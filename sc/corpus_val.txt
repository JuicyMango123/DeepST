- (FR) Mr President , honourable Members , since the election of President Berdymukhamedov , Turkmenistan has effectively entered a new phase of its development , and several positive signs of change have
For example , they have lifted certain restrictions on freedom of movement within the country , they have amended the constitution so as to strengthen the role of the parliament , they
have created an institute of democracy and human rights , they have hosted the United Nations Centre for Preventive Diplomacy in Ashgabat and , for the first time , they authorised international observers
Moreover , in the last two years , since the new president was elected , several of the proposed measures have been adopted - I do not wish to repeat those mentioned
Reforms have also begun in the field of education , with the modernisation of the teaching system , the training of teachers abroad , the extension of the education period and the
Furthermore , in September 2008 - again , for the first time - a visitor's permit was granted to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief , who
Of course , you may rest assured that , during these meetings , we will still address issues of concern , notably the situation of political prisoners , the freedom of assembly , of the
media , of worship , and the rights of minorities , and on each occasion we will stress our commitment to respect for human rights and their importance for long-term economic and social
In principle I share some of these fears , and I also recognise that Turkmenistan still has some way to go before it is fully compliant with international standards on
Applying the Interim Trade Agreement , by which I mean the trade-related provisions of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement , would be a positive first step that would enable us to engage
In this regard , I should like to point out that Article 1 of the Interim Trade Agreement and Article 2 of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement contain clauses referring to
respect for democracy and fundamental rights as essential elements of each agreement , but above all that both agreements contain clauses enabling each party to take appropriate measures in the event
It will certainly not resolve all of the human rights problems in Turkmenistan , but it will help to ensure that international standards are complied with more fully , particularly in
This collaboration is all the more important given the recent renewed engagement of the international community in Afghanistan and in Pakistan , and , in fact , regional conferences are due to
That is why I remain convinced that , by engaging with Turkmenistan , we will be in a better position to put forward our arguments in favour of a more open
We shall continue to encourage the authorities to make progress in other areas , such as the reform of the penal and civil code , the legislation on religion , the freedom of
- Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , before giving the floor to the various speakers for this debate , I am going to allow myself - being , as I am , responsible for multilingual
issues in Parliament's Bureau - to read you some advice from a leaflet prepared for new MEPs on how to speak so that the interpreting can be correctly done , and
Also , when you are chairing a meeting , wait a moment before giving the floor to the next speaker so that the interpreters can finish the speech and change to
Thank you very much for your interpreting , and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the interpreters , who make our work possible through their own , which is so
First of all , and it is no coincidence in the context of this debate , I would like to welcome the compromise reached at the last European Council meeting on the
I am pleased that the Nabucco project has been declared a priority energy project and that our efforts as Members of the European Parliament in support of this project have
However , returning to today's debate , I believe that among our concerns with regard to Turkmenistan there are clearly two which stand out of equal importance: economic cooperation , specifically in the
However , I would like to highlight that it is not too early for us to discuss specific paths of cooperation with Turkmenistan and its inclusion in the European Union's
Based on the EU's experience so far , it should be obvious that progress is made on these topics quickest when they are part of a broader discussion touching on
I wonder whether it would not be useful to have similar ones too for the level of economic integration , but of a realistic , long-term nature , or some which relate
- Mr President , I thank the Commissioner and Mr Vondra , for the Council , for their explanation , but I am certain they felt that there is still some hesitation on
The difficulty arises because for the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) , Parliament will have to give its assent , whereas this is not the case for the Interim Trade Agreement
Because of this , when it comes to the Interim Trade Agreement , in our resolution we can only highlight our points and raise our concerns and give support with regard to
We are fully aware of the facts , but I am certain you can find some form of commitment and look into further developing and exploring legal bases on which
So it is not that we are not fully aware of what has happened and it is not the case that we are not aware how important Turkmenistan is ,
I would like you to look into this again and that is why I specifically ask you to do me a favour: look into our paragraph 11 , where we raise
Commissioner , I am aware of and took note of your points , but I am certain there is something you can do to further explore how we can strengthen this
If you could do something about paragraph 8 , this would be more than helpful for us; it relates to monitoring which we always like to have and which we are
We have done this under other circumstances , so look at what you can do here , how you can be helpful in defining what monitoring means , but do us a
- (FR) Mr President , I believe that we must try not to fool ourselves but realise that , although Valery Pal has been released , the Turkmen Government will continue to
Although the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion has travelled to Turkmenistan , nine other special rapporteurs are still awaiting their permits , and these are people who cover such
We continue to be faced with one of the world's most repressive and closed regimes , even if there has been some progress and even if we do need to
It is important for us not to be na√Øve , either , or obviously to demand that Turkmenistan become a model of democracy and human rights before reaching any agreement with
I propose quite simply that we have a real foreign policy , and that we meet criteria which are extremely precise , which are measurable , which are realistic and which are
I am thinking of the realignment of the education system with international standards - which is under way but still very far from satisfactory - of the release of
I believe that , when the time comes for the Commission and the Council to discuss the future of the human rights clauses , it is imperative that these clauses be
The President has a light in front of him through which the interpreters send him an SOS when they stop interpreting because they are not able to keep up
- (DE) Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , it is already a year since this Parliament said very clearly and plainly what progress it considered necessary in
They were demands that are relatively easy to satisfy: free and unimpeded access for the International Red Cross , the release of political prisoners and conscientious objectors , the abolition of
I do not necessary share their views , but as the social democrat Members said , we - Parliament - want a guarantee from you that , if Parliament demands that this Interim
The fact that it states that it can be done is not the point; the point is that you are prepared , if Parliament so demands , to accede to that
I ask all my honourable friends , if we want to take ourselves seriously , not to agree tomorrow , unless the Commission agrees in writing and reads out here that this demand
- Mr President , like the two previous speakers , I fear that the Commission and the Council have both painted rather a rose-tinted view of what is now the situation in
The current President may be marginally better than the President he replaced in February 2007 , but is he sufficiently better for us to agree to an interim trade agreement as
As Mr Markov and Ms Flautre said , in the Committee on International Trade we set five very clear tasks for Turkmenistan that we would want to see met before
Unless the Commission and the Council can tell me differently , I understand that up until now the Red Cross has not been able to visit one single prison or
The Council is right to say that it has expanded the secondary education system by one year , but my understanding again is that , despite minor improvements in the education
Well , there is no press freedom , there is no free access for NGOs , and , while the UN inspector on religious tolerance may have been allowed in , Turkmenistan has the
Cynics might say that it is because gas and oil have been discovered in Turkmenistan , because we want to build a new pipeline , because we suddenly find it in
- (DA) Mr President , I , too , totally disagree with the proposal that the European Parliament should unconditionally approve the trade agreement with Turkmenistan , which is , after all , what we are
We can write whatever we want in our justification , but once we have pressed the green button the matter will be out of our hands if we do not
In my opinion it is an absurd justification that indirectly invites all dictators to hold out , for in that way we will come to heel at some point down
I think that it should be said loud and clear that there can be too high a price for gas and if the price of gas is agreements with
In fact they are of vital strategic value to the EU , given the Union's wish , and Turkmenistan's apparent desire , to move out of Russia's shadow when it comes to
The country is a prime example of a peaceful and stable Muslim country with a secular government committed to fighting Islamist terrorism in Afghanistan , where we have a war
Of course there are still serious concerns about human rights , democracy and political freedoms , but such concerns also exist with regard to Russia and China , and I do not remember
- (IT) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I hope that this debate on the interim agreement can serve as an opportunity to begin a thorough examination of the situation in
The Ashkhabat government recently rejected a series of recommendations including the release of political prisoners , reviewing past cases of political imprisonment and lifting the travel ban arbitrarily imposed on human
In 2006 I myself was part of a European Parliament delegation that travelled to Turkmenistan , and we made a number of proposals at that time which you have taken up ,
Clearly , I understand your arguments and those of the Council , but when I compare what has been proposed and the report on Central Asia - which we voted in favour
of in this very House a few months ago , on 20 February 2008 and in which we repeated our demands concerning the release of prisoners , the Red Cross , and so
Personally , when I read 'Turkmenistan report' , I actually read 'Nabucco report' because , at the end of the day , we are interested in the energy , in the gas of this third
Furthermore , I know - it was explained to us very well when we were in Turkmenistan - that , were the European Union not interested in Turkmen gas , then the
His concluding remarks , had he not been cut off , were to the effect that the EU should be encouraged - and indeed the Commission and Council should finance -
trans-Caspian pipelines to Central Asia in order to reduce the danger of being reliant on a monopoly source , so that we are able to avoid possibly falling prey to the
We are going to examine within the Bureau whether , in this section , the floor may be given to speakers who have already participated in the debate , because what they usually
Would it be the Commission that decides whether there has been a breach of human rights and , if the Commission so decides , will it be agreed in the Council
We have human rights clauses in many of our international agreements and to date - with the exception of the next debate - we have hardly ever invoked any
I would like once more to stress that the current human rights clause in the agreement allows for suspension in the case of breaches of human rights; on suspension
Of course the final decision will be made by the Council looking at all options of restrictive measures , including the possibility of suspension , and here we have precedents regarding some
So , based on the information available , we have to admit that there is much to be done and improved , but at the same time we can see positive things
The Presidency is convinced that there is an opportunity now to engage with Turkmenistan , and that approach is the only effective means of establishing a frank dialogue on issues such
A negative opinion from Parliament would be damaging to our nascent dialogue with Turkmenistan and would undermine our ability to secure progress in important areas such as greater respect
May I just remind you that , after the events in Andijan , for instance , the Council did decide to impose restrictive measures on Uzbekistan , including an arms embargo as well as
In this regard , should such a similar incident - or just a grave deterioration - occur , the Council could take similar measures or even consider a suspension , and the Commission
In our view , this seems quite difficult as it would imply reopening negotiations with Turkmenistan - which already signed and ratified the PCA in 2004 - as well as
Insofar as this aims at establishing whether a breach of human rights can lead to a suspension of the PCA , I would like to reiterate that both the PCA and
Both the PCA and the Interim Agreement have a clause to the effect that , if either party considers that the other party has failed to fulfil an obligation under
Both the interim agreement and the PCA also contain a joint declaration clarifying that cases of special urgency mean cases of material breach of the agreement by either party , both
This would be , in the trade agreement , a stepping stone for increased cooperation , and would take us a step further in bringing the framework for dialogue with Turkmenistan on
One core statement by the Council , my dear Mr Vondra , has particularly stuck in my mind: the people of Turkmenistan will certainly not learn what democracy and human rights mean
It would be a huge concession by the European Parliament , if we now basically ignored the specifications which we set about three months or six months ago and said that ,
I am also clear about the fact that we should not use Turkmenistan and the Interim Agreement as a hostage in order to shift the balance of power between
I am also clear about the fact that it would set a precedent if the Commission and the Council were to agree to the demands which many of us have
I therefore await - preferably this evening - an undertaking from the Commission that , if this monitoring shows that the situation in Turkmenistan has deteriorated and if Parliament passes
I would be delighted if we were , in any case , to receive an undertaking from the Council that it would immediately include and discuss this issue at one of its
Formal sitting - 20th anniversary of German reunification
Dear colleagues , ladies and gentlemen , let me , on your behalf , welcome to the European Parliament all our honoured guests
Thank you for coming
Many of us remember - some of us who are very young will know it from history - the reunification of Germany 20 years ago
Margaret Thatcher and the President of France , Fran√ßois Mitterrand , and , of course , the foreign ministers of the four countries , negotiating the reunification treaty
One of the foreign ministers is today with us
I am very glad to welcome to the European Parliament Mr Roland Dumas
We are very glad to see you
We also greet both German leaders at that time: the Chancellor of West Germany , Helmut Kohl and the Prime Minister of East Germany , Lothar de Maizi√®re
Welcome to the European Parliament , 20 years later
The European institutions played a very important role in German reunification
I should also like to say on behalf of all of us: welcome home , Enrique Bar√≥n Crespo , former President of the European Parliament
Enrique , it is your home
Thank you for coming
And last , but certainly not least , the President of the European Commission in those times , President Jacques Delors
We are very glad to see you
We are very grateful and we remember very well your speeches from those times
You were a great supporter of German unity and it was very important for all of us
There would be no reunification of Europe without the reunification of Germany
Those days were momentous for our continent and we can be proud of it and we will forever remember those days
(The House accorded the speaker a standing ovation)
again
It is a great honour for me to be able to speak to you on this occasion today in the European Parliament
This makes it clear that the reunification of Germany was by no means just a national matter , but also a fundamental European issue
I could even say that by unifying Germany , we have put an end to the misguided nationalism of the European peoples
things that unite us
Today , 7 October , is an appropriate day for this occasion because it marks the founding of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) 61 years ago
For 40 years , the Day of the Republic was celebrated lavishly and even ostentatiously on 7 October
However , I became Prime Minister in order to abolish the GDR and to lead the East Germans into unity
At no point did we have the opportunity to resolve the open German question except in the context of European unity
world wars
In 1957 , Chancellor Konrad Adenauer ensured that the treaties enshrined the full membership of the East Germans in the case of reunification
This turned the intention behind the preamble to the German constitution , which refers to acting on behalf of those who have been prevented from participating , into a practical policy
As a result , the German question always remained on the agenda , because it was also one of the keys to overcoming the division of Europe
The two things are inextricably linked: the war which was started and lost by Germany and the Iron Curtain which divided Europe
One particularly tragic aspect of this was that those people who were particularly hard hit by the Iron Curtain were the same people who had suffered most under National Socialism
rule
However , from this moment on , many people across the Eastern bloc states knew that the system that we lived under could not be reformed , but only overcome
me , believed would not be fulfilled in their lifetimes
Freedom had no voice
It was a time of oppressive silence and paralysis
However , all of this changed in October 1978 with the election of a Polish cardinal as Pope
His faith and his words alone unsettled the intolerant regimes
Firstly , the Polish people and then the whole world realised that this man said what he believed and believed what he said
of upheaval
(Loud applause)
no longer be stopped
The decisive factor in all of this is that none of the peoples were fighting just for themselves
Anyone who called communism into question was doing so on behalf of everyone
Perhaps that is an ironic result of internationalism
Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa not only changed their own world , but also ours
We Germans have a great deal to thank the Polish people for
(Loud applause)
Today , we should also remember the names of other figures who were representative of many people
I will only mention Andrei Sakharov and V√°clav Havel , who had already pulled stones out of the wall in Berlin long before it actually fell in 1989
(Applause)
I would also like once again to emphasise our respect and gratitude towards Hungary which was the first country to be brave enough to open its borders
(Applause)
It was a time when people acted on behalf of one another , because of their longing for freedom
This upheaval was a genuine joint effort and its most important result should and must be a lasting European community
Therefore , we should see these experiences as a challenge to search in Europe from now on for the things which unite us
(Applause)
and lethal borders
In this situation , the Brandenburg Gate in November 1989 bore witness to the fact that people were shaking off and destroying the yoke of oppression
The closed Brandenburg Gate stood as a symbol of separation
unity of Germany had been achieved in freedom
Now , people could rightly say that the Brandenburg Gate had become the gate of freedom
of the Berlin Wall , the Brandenburg Gate has become a symbol of European unity
which I have outlined here
(Applause)
the vitality and persuasive power of democracy as a form of government
A total of 93
4% of the electorate turned out to vote in the elections
I believe that this is a record which will not be matched in the near future
No one was left untouched by these elections
in the spring of 1990
The people of the GDR acted confidently and responsibly and did justice to their newly acquired freedom
Democracy and freedom are not simply abstract concepts
They permeate and define all aspects of our lives
the Volkskammer immediately made it clear to all our neighbours that the changes in the GDR and the reunification of Germany were not a cause for concern
The parliament immediately , and of its own free will , admitted responsibility for the whole of German history
It bowed its head before the victims and guaranteed our Polish neighbours secure borders
It also asked for forgiveness for the GDR's involvement in crushing the Prague Spring
and community
This admission of responsibility alone represented the beginning of the work of the only freely elected East German Parliament
Everything that followed was linked to this admission and was the consequence of it , so to speak
unite us in Europe
The East German Parliament gave me the responsibility of putting in place the process which would bring about the unity of the two states
the people's enthusiasm for unity
The elections on 18 March 1990 were also a plebiscite on the German question
However , we still had to devote ourselves to drawing up treaties and putting in place regulations covering an almost endless number of problems
All areas of society were subjected to fundamental change
all democratised
local elections on 6 May 1990
I am very pleased to see Roland Dumas here - which we signed in Moscow on 12 December
(Applause)
In those six months , we achieved a huge amount and we are justified in referring to this as the most hardworking parliament in our history
I remain grateful to this day for the fact that all our partners were highly committed comrades-in-arms
There are so many names which I could refer to at this point , but I would just like to mention Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev and George Bush senior
The speech about a common European house was one of the main starting points for Gorbachev's policy of glasnost and perestroika
It finally opened a door to unity for the Germans
For this reason , we should never forget that Russia is an important part of this European house and that our partnership with Russia is essential to our survival
(Applause)
On the basis of the Atlantic Alliance , George Bush provided special protection for our right to self-determination
in the process of bringing about German unity
He was a true friend to the people of Germany
Many thanks
(Applause)
Kohl , who is undisputedly a very great European
(Applause)
Two important things came together here
In an unrivalled act of self-liberation by peaceful means , the East Germans overthrew an oppressive regime and brought down the wall
Through democratic elections , they succeeded in bringing about fundamental change
With heads held high , the East Germans said 'We are the people' and then , a few weeks later , 'We are one people'
Those who achieved so much in such a short time should be full of self-confidence and pride
They have every reason to believe that they can withstand what we are now referring to as a crisis and that they will emerge stronger from every crisis
We have experience of transformation
(Applause)
On the other hand , we have also realised that we are part of this great community of European peoples and part of the Atlantic Alliance
Other states and peoples have also defended our freedom and have done everything in their power to help us to achieve unity
Therefore , it is important for us to remind ourselves and future generations that we Germans were ourselves responsible for the defeat and division of our country
We have our friends , neighbours and partners to thank for our unity and freedom
(Applause)
However , reunification did not just create the Germany that we know today
It also , of course , brought about fundamental changes in the old Federal Republic and throughout Europe
This process of change is continuing undiminished
Our people and our country were able to stop running round in circles over the German question
acting as an equal member of a united Europe
have achieved our unity peacefully , in cooperation with our neighbours , and we largely owe it to those neighbours
However , above all , we see this task as a valuable service provided by our country
This will allow us to put something into practice externally which internally represents the decisive content of democracy
Democracy is much less a type of state and much more a genuine service offered by everyone to the community and for the common good
More than any other type of regime , democracy calls for everyone to take action and to become involved
The same applies to the social market economy , which is more than just an economic system
It requires and encourages a sense of responsibility among all citizens
It puts the common good before self-interest and it uses property in the service of the community , without which it cannot be guaranteed
In one way or another , we must keep saying to ourselves that the important issue is to replace division with participation in our country and in Europe
However , participation does not mean that everyone is given something
Instead it means that everyone can contribute something and needs to participate
I am increasingly concerned about the growing contempt for the rights which form the foundation for our freedom
The authenticity and the power of democracy come solely from the attitude of the citizens
This concept of citizenship is what allows us to live together as a community and encourages us always to search for those things which unite us
We are part of a community of peoples who guarantee the rights of citizens , strive for peace and prosperity and want to live in peace
freedom and if it can find the unity which we lost after the Second World War
no longer had a centre
An honest search for the things which unite us is also a search for our centre
granted and go almost unnoticed
I am thinking of freedom of travel , of speech , of trade , of the press and of religion
I am thinking of the right to free and fair elections with a secret ballot and the right to codetermination
People nowadays take all of this so much for granted that they hardly notice it any more
There is always a risk that no attention will be paid to these things and that they will not be valued
Sometimes I feel disturbed when I remember how often people tend to gamble away what they have achieved , because they take it for granted and no longer appreciate it
They also make too little effort to expand their achievements
(Applause)
We are often faced with difficult tasks
Now that we have enlarged the European Union , we also need to give it more depth
However , these tasks are still much more appealing than a relapse into conflict
It is so much better to work together to overcome crises and resolve problems than to face them alone
(Applause)
The greatest disaster for the peoples of Europe would be a return to a lack of unity
For this reason , and in particular on a day like today , let us search for all the things that unite us
The rights and the freedoms which I have referred to form the heart and the centre of our society and of the European Union and our community of values
These are the things which unite us
From this centre comes the decisive and perhaps the only important duty which is imposed on us as citizens of Europe
We should be prepared to defend these rights and freedoms
The defence of freedom lies at the heart of Europe
(Applause)
We have learned that freedom is indivisible
Germany
Europe
It has also made the freedom of the whole of Europe complete
For this reason , the peoples of Europe can only find the things that are their own in the truest sense of the word within the community
We must preserve freedom within our community in order to ensure ourselves a positive future
The last century , with its climaxes and terrible low points , has taught us one thing
History is not a mysterious destiny that is visited on peoples
History is simply the things which people do
However , it is more difficult to influence people's actions by calling on them to change than it is by setting them a good example
Those things which apply to individuals also apply to members of parliament , governments and entire peoples
We cannot demand that our citizens take a freedom-loving , democratic approach to life
We have to set them an example
the things which unite us in everything we do
a united Germany , the fatherland that I love , and for Europe , whose unity will determine our fate and our future
Thank you very much
(Loud , sustained applause)
and our common European future
But the most exciting moment was , of course , on 3 October 1990
You will have realised that I did not welcome to the European Parliament former President of the European Parliament , Hans-Gert P√∂ttering , because Hans-Gert , you are one of us
You sit here every day and work with us , but we are very glad that we are sitting in your honourable place among us
Now we have our second honoured speaker , Jacques Delors
First , he was appointed as an advisor to the Prime Minister of France , Jacques Chaban-Delmas
Later , for two and a half years , he was a Member of the European Parliament
Probably not all of us remember that
Later , he was also a Minister of Economy and Finance
He had two terms in office as President of the European Commission
He led the single market project and was a key player in the preparation and implementation of the Maastricht Treaty , which was very important for the whole European Union
He was the founder and the President of the think tank Notre Europe , and some other initiatives
(Applause)
former President of the European Commission
the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany
part in peaceful demonstrations
West
We therefore witnessed a moment in time when history accelerated , and we must admit that it took us all by surprise
Some of us knew intuitively that there were growing imbalances in the communist countries , but no one could have known that the lid would blow off so fast
in China
threats to peace
This did not happen
This is the second lesson , after the one learned from the popular uprising
We , who have lived through these events , must bear witness to them
Indeed , new generations must be taught about the events of that period , since they did not experience them first-hand
Today , they live in prosperity and peace , while seeing the tensions and revolts that are shaking the world from afar
Therefore , the only images of violence and hatred they see are through the prism of the media
that Europeans were able to live through a transition that was admittedly emotional , but free of any significant bloodshed and dangerous contamination
(Applause)
forgetting someone , offending sensibilities , or being misunderstood
Some of them , I should add , have unfortunately suffered the ingratitude of their peoples and their successors
History , I am sure , will correct these errors and omissions and will shine the light of truth on these events
However , let us return for a moment to the shock of the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989
to which Mr de Maizi√®re has referred
free to choose , and that there was a place for them in the European Community
I added , and I quote: 'We are a great community within which we shall together build our destiny to better harness history in the interest of all
'
At the time , it was not possible to say more
It was my duty to send a message of welcome and hope to our East German friends
At the same time , I tried to allay the fears and anxieties felt by many people
East and West Germany and the four allied powers of World War Two , the 'Two-plus-Four' Process
Kohl
This raised many questions , it should be said , within the European Community in light of this radically shifting political landscape
Dublin
the Community remained true to the values for which it stands: peace , mutual understanding between peoples , and solidarity , especially with all Germans in the East and in the West
beacon for the peoples living under the communist yoke
Indeed , let me just remind you: the Community was moving in concert with these events
had persuaded the G7 to adopt a plan to help the countries of Central and Eastern Europe
The spirit of openness and a favourable predisposition towards enlargement had already been formally confirmed
Nevertheless , after the fall of the Wall , the German question , it has to be said , was a major concern
What path would reunited Germany choose
On 19 November 1989 , on the initiative of Mr Mitterrand , an extraordinary European Council met to pave the way for regular consultations between the two Germanies and their partners
A long presentation by Chancellor Kohl summed up the situation which , of course , was still necessarily in flux
History had begun on its accelerated course
The European Parliament was also very active and attentive during this time
boost given by the Single European Act of 1987
the right to live within secure borders as currently defined
' In this way , the European Parliament referred to one of the most difficult debates , which was resolved by maintaining the Oder-Neisse border
On 17 January 1990 , I stood before the European Parliament as President of the European Commission and stated that , and I quote: 'East Germany is a separate case
It belongs within the Community , if that is what it wants
' This prospect led your Parliament to set up a temporary commission to study the impact of the German reunification process on the European Community
and paved the way for it
but a reality
The commission demonstrated it on that occasion
(Applause)
All things considered , we should not underestimate the achievements and influence of European integration , regardless of the obstacles standing in its way
Of course , I will not attempt to single out the most important facts and ideas that were able to influence this great liberation movement
Undoubtedly what comes first is the people's ability to stand up to oppression , to express their thirst for freedom , and to quietly display their courage
juncture: 'Have no fear
' Nor can I forget West Germany's firm but open and generous policy towards the GDR during the years leading up to the fall of the Wall
Freedom triumphed , but with freedom come obligations
The treaty on the reunification of Germany presented two challenges
The first was for the people of West and East Germany to understand each other
This was met with great presence of mind , understanding and generosity
The second was economic and social , and equally difficult to meet
ladies and gentlemen , EUR 1 400 billion over 20 years
This is without mentioning the other contributions in the form of technical assistance , which was required to restructure the East German economy
A single figure illustrates the scale of this achievement: over a twenty-year period , per capita income in the GDR went from 40% to 73% of the West Germans' income
The effort will continue over the years to come thanks to the ongoing payment of the solidarity tax - if I am not mistaken , it will continue until 2019
The Germans themselves agree to this
Work still needs to be done to change mindsets as much as economic and social structures
For its part , the European Community contributed by extending economic and social cohesion policy , which MEPs know well , to the Eastern L√§nder
in the European adventure , the increased human and technical exchanges and the regular dialogue between the European Commission and the leaders of the new L√§nder
Fund effort any further
to deepen European integration , or to live day to day as a result of compromises that may well be necessary but that do not bode well for the future
(Applause)
Today , as we joyfully celebrate German reunification , how can we fail to ask Germany what future it sees for Europe
Reunified Germany is the economic powerhouse of the 27 countries that make up the Union
To cite just one figure , Germany produces 25% of the total GDP of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)
but also the obligations , that this entails
Many people in Europe perhaps tend to forget this
(Applause)
In geopolitical terms , Germany is today poised between the European Union and the rest of the large European continent
This is a strong and , in many ways , attractive position , which raises many questions both within and outside of Germany
The Germans themselves agree with this view , as the White Paper on security in Germany clearly shows
the heart of the continent
'
We are therefore no longer in the pre-1989 period , when Germany showed restraint and tact , for reasons that everybody could understand and even be thankful for
Deutschmark because it is 10 Marks and is the symbol of Germany's rebirth - in exchange for the euro , for the single currency
Member States
Are the values handed down to us by the founding fathers of Europe still meaningful
Do they still prevail
The legacy we have been given has more to do with why we want to live alongside one another than with the treaties , which are merely necessary institutional agreements
However , I would not wish to end on this slightly pessimistic note , with this question mark hanging over matters
No , emphatically not
the pleasure and honour of being invited to that memorable evening gathering in the former Reichstag
The leaders of West and East Germany enthusiastically came together in an atmosphere marked by solemnity and joy
All Europeans would have shared that deep emotion
After the ceremony I wanted to experience what a nation was feeling by going out on to the streets of Berlin
There , too , I saw only solemnity and joy; there was no fanfare or ostentatious demonstrations

You will surely agree that so much remains to be done to consolidate our achievements and progress into the future
(The House accorded the speaker a standing ovation)
We remember , Mr Delors , your speech at the College of Europe in Bruges at the beginning of 1990
It was about German reunification , and German reunification , in your words , was the best way for better coordination in Europe and a better future for Europe
It was a great and visionary speech
Thank you very much for your speech today as well
Let me thank our honourable guests from Spain , from France , from Germany , and the presidents of our institutions , the Commission and the Council , for being together with us
We will now hear the European anthem
Four great world leaders were there: the President of the United States , George Bush senior , the leader of the Soviet Union , Mikhail Gorbachev , the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom ,
Mr President , Mr Delors , ladies and gentlemen , as I look around , I can spot many well-known and familiar faces here and I am very pleased to see all of you
Therefore , I want to use the opportunity presented by this anniversary and my speech to call on all the people of Europe to strive to achieve all of the

History will see them as astonishing proof of the fact that we East Germans , after liberating ourselves in the autumn of 1989 , succeeded in introducing democracy to our country
On the 20th anniversary of these elections to the Volkskammer , I said in the Reichstag , and I would like to reinforce this once again here , how important it was that
It did all of this before choosing a new government , because the new era after the end of the Cold War was to be a time of reconciliation , peace
This admission remains valid even now that the GDR has come to an end and it represents an obligation to search in everything we do for those things which
I would like to emphasise that all of us at that time were only able to achieve those things that had long since become clear as a result of
The German states were reintroduced , the separation of powers was re-established , the state under the rule of law was restored and education , the police and the administrative bodies were

Rights-based management tools in fisheries (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Attwooll on rights-based management tools in fisheries
rapporteur
in many ways sensitive issue
In some public debate , rights-based management is equated with the employment of individual transferable quotas
are seen as a common public good
So understood , it is clear that there is a variety of such forms currently in operation throughout the EU
some mixture of these
Similarly , although the right is implicitly transferable , there are various limitations in this respect
For example , that from Community to Member States is conditioned by the principle of relative stability
Further , there seems to be a considerable range of such limitations
One particular form of divergence between Member States is how far transfer for economic value is permitted , either formally or informally , and thus amounts to a tradable right
The central issue is , then , how fisheries management should engage in constituting the right to harvest in order best to obtain the objectives of the common fisheries policy
The Commission communication raises the question of the extent to which a single system might be introduced , either at Community level or by harmonising the practice of Member States
in which some of these might be prevented
It indicates too the way in which certain types of rights-based management can have positive effects , provided they are properly devised
issues involved
It is consequently rightly cautious about the idea of moving to any single system
species and multi-species fisheries
allow a longer time for debate
In conclusion , I would like to touch more deeply on one aspect of the report
Although rights-based management is essentially a juristic concept , I have the impression that much of the drive towards its discussion has come from economists
I do not think that anyone here would doubt that fisheries management must take account of sound economic principles
Indeed the report indicates some of the positive outcomes to which economic efficiency may give rise
But such efficiency has to be seen as an instrumental good
As the report states , it is valuable insofar as it promotes the objectives of the CFP
may prove counterproductive to some aspects of them
I seek reassurance , therefore , that the Commission will take a genuinely rounded approach , both in relation to the content and to the outcome of the study
Member of the Commission
contents of which I can almost fully endorse
The report recognises the main advantage of rights-based management systems as being increased economic rationale in fisheries
This is a crucial issue in the present context , where poor economic performance is the rule rather than the exception
The quest for a higher degree of economic efficiency generally has very positive effects on overcapacity and hence on sustainability of fisheries activities
The report , however , also accurately identifies the possible negative effects
the report , to protect artisanal fleets
some time
As stated in the report , such systems are a complex matter , but difficulties associated with them are not insurmountable
On balance , I think the possible benefits are larger than the possible negative effects
However , I would like to confirm once more that the Commission has no intention of proposing Community management systems
Nor is it the Commission's intention to promote a given and universal rights-based management system
Different fisheries will require different systems
I am also fully aware of the sensitivity of this issue in relation to relative stability
The Commission will continue working on this issue
with fisheries competences
We will also consider issuing guidelines or similar supporting documents to that effect
Member States and experiences in third countries will be important inputs for this process
In the medium term , rights-based management is going to be one of the topics in our reflection towards the next reform of the common fisheries policy
The Commission will keep you informed about these future developments and I look forward to further fruitful discussions with you on this important issue

for the better
they are dragging the more dynamic sectors towards a dead end
sustainable approaches , it has advantages that are far from negligible
in discards and lower dependency on public aid
therefore perhaps we need more economists in fisheries than there are at present , to analyse these issues in more detail
Having said this , I wish the Commission great success in this debate and I hope that the management model , which has been a failure , can be changed in the future
on behalf of the PSE Group
- (PT) I should like to congratulate Mrs Attwooll for her hard work to achieve the maximum possible consensus on her report
most precious resource for all who make up Europe's innumerable fishing communities
I therefore think that the report strikes exactly the right balance between the different points of view
The results of the vote in the Committee on Fisheries - 21 in favour out of 24 - bears out what I have just said
It is important not to avoid this debate but equally important not to decide too hastily
introduction of management systems involving trade in fishing rights , which might bring benefits for shipowners with greater purchasing power to the detriment of smaller shipowners
I also fear that the general adoption of such a system might be counter-productive , possibly even leading to higher catches to offset the cost of acquiring the fishing right
and the different types of fisheries plus a wide-ranging debate to assess all the variables involved in this issue

as the sovereignty of Member States in the management of their fisheries resources and the setting up of private property rights for access to and exploitation of that public good

In our view , each Member State should be responsible for managing its marine resources , in particular as a way of safeguarding its food sovereignty

Madam President , this is a complex area and I certainly commend Ms Attwooll for her report and her efforts in that regard
EU-based management system
Rather , I am quite clear that Member States should be able to decide what management system works best for them
Moreover , maintaining stability , I fear , could be severely jeopardised in the industry if unregulated transferable quotas were embraced , with particular threat to single and small-scale operators
of enjoying the confidence of those affected
I also fear that this new study will prove to be another protracted excuse for putting off real and helpful change
I hope that does not prove to be so , but we have seen that in the past

kind of stock market , which would naturally lead to the industrialisation of fishing and pose a threat to the equilibrium of the ecosystems and fishing communities
as cautious as possible in this debate
Madam President , I would like to thank Ms Attwooll for her work and welcome this report as it has initiated a much-needed debate on alternative management measures
an answer to our problems , and that it is necessary to hold a wide-ranging debate
In its green paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy , the Commission states that: 'Alternative management mechanisms can play a significant complementary role in Community fisheries management

Furthermore , fisheries management will have to be increasingly based on adaptive approaches as historical data will be less valuable
and ensure sustainability of resources
Member of the Commission

I agree with what the rapporteur said , namely that fisheries cannot be looked at purely in economic terms
I need to stress here that the subject is far from simple
I certainly agree that such systems are a complex matter
protection of artisanal fisheries , and we have to approach this matter gradually
States and look at experiences in third countries
All this will clearly be an important issue for discussion in the context of the next reform
I certainly look forward to the input from the Committee on Fisheries on this issue
I have noted all the comments made by all the parliamentarians who have spoken on this subject
rapporteur
giving pre-eminence to one particular form of rights-based management , whereas what the report is seeking is a review of all different types of forms to assess their merits and demerits
I think we are all agreed that the common fisheries policy is in need of reform
A newspaper in my constituency that picked up the European Parliament press release on the report cites me as being cautious about the reform of the CFP
This is certainly not so if it is taken to mean that I have any doubts about the need for reform
I am cautious , as I think we all are , to the extent of wanting to be reassured that the reform is in the right direction

My feeling was that , whilst quota and effort limitations both combine readily with territorial restrictions , neither of the first two sits that comfortably with the other

I would not like to think that , in advance of a thorough study , some prior decision had been taken as to what might achieve the very best balance
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday
- Madam President , my thanks are due to the shadow rapporteurs and all on the Fisheries Committee for producing a well-balanced report on what is a very complex and
The report takes a much broader view , treating the term as covering any of the forms that can be taken by the right to harvest fish , given that these
For example , the extent of the right may be specified by reference to the territory to be fished , the amount of fish to be harvested , the effort allowed or
The report of the Fisheries Committee details a number of concerns about the adverse impacts that certain types of rights-based management might have , but also touches on the manner
The report notes the variety of systems of rights-based management currently in place , the degree to which the forms of right concerned are hybrid ones and the complexity of the

- Madam President , first of all allow me to thank the rapporteur , Ms Attwooll , and all the members of the Committee on Fisheries for a very thorough report , the
In my opinion , such effects could be contained , if not eliminated , by introducing provisions intended to limit concentration of rights , to deal with allocation issues and , as proposed by
These are being dealt with by various means in third countries where rights-based management systems in general , and individual transferable quotas in particular , have been in place for quite
In the short term , we are aiming at increasing the general knowledge on rights-based management and identifying best practices to be shared with Member States' national or regional governments

We can therefore only express our satisfaction at the Commission's decision to finally examine the possibilities of this fisheries management tool , although in my opinion , in a too simplistic and
Those who are the most resistant to change and the least enterprising , both in the fisheries sector and in the Council , have always feared any change to management systems , even
This does not mean that these sectors and Member States are in a better situation , or even in the same situation as they were 30 years ago , but rather
It is true that management through the allocation of fishing rights raises questions with regard to implementation , but it is just as true that countries in which fishing is an
important sector for the future have been able to resolve them , demonstrating that , at least for parts of the fleet that are able to evolve towards more modern , efficient and
We therefore also welcome Mrs Attwooll's report , which , alongside the concerns , has succeeded in reflecting the possible advantages , which could include improvements in control , a reduction in capacity , a decrease
I would like to say to Mrs Attwooll that fishing is indeed an economic activity , and one that needs to be profitable , which is now ceasing to be the case ,
This is a complex and controversial issue but it is extremely important for all who are concerned about the sustainability of resources , and this includes the sustainability of the
As a Member elected for a Member State where the small-scale and multi-species fisheries which predominate in the south of Europe are very important , I am concerned about the
I therefore repeat that I support the overall conclusions of the report , to the effect that no decisions should be adopted until we have studies covering all Member States
- (PT) I should like to begin by paying tribute to the commitment of the rapporteur , Mrs Attwooll , in drawing up a balanced report on a question as fundamental
However , although we appreciate paragraph 11 , the report contains many points on which we totally disagree , for example , viewing this debate as an anticipation of the necessary modification of the
We therefore reject any step-by-step process that could , in future , lead to the setting up of a rights-based management system in Community fisheries , that is the marketing of fishing
Representing a region whose overall experience of the common fisheries policy has been far from positive , I must say that my natural inclination is strongly against the imposition of any
It would be better by far in my book to repatriate real powers over fishing to Member States and concentrate on getting in place viable local management systems capable
(PT) I would also like to congratulate our rapporteur , Mrs Attwooll , and to say that , in my opinion , the natural marine heritage should be preserved and should be used in
I therefore do not share the vision of marine ecosystems and the associated fishing communities as a market , where fishing rights may be freely traded , perhaps even on a
Even more , it seems to me that we simply must not allow anything to jeopardise the principle of relative stability and I therefore think that the Commission should be
I strongly agree with the report when it points out that the current fisheries management systems within the EU , specifically in the area of TACs and quotas , do not provide
' However , I would venture to suggest that alternative management measures should and must play a compulsory role in the future , as we need to take on board a range
As I pointed out in my now redundant opinion of the Committee on Fisheries for the report by the Temporary Committee on Climate Change , I have no doubt that climate
change will impact on EU fisheries regulations , as allocations of quotas based on historic catch patterns will need to be revised as a result of the shifting distribution of fish
As climate change and other factors increasingly impact on our fish stocks , our management will need the necessary flexibility , based on sound peer-reviewed science , to adapt to the new conditions
- Madam President , I think that we all share a common objective: that of achieving a balance between the economic efficiency of such systems but , at the same time ,
As I said before , we have to take into account in our reflections possible limitations on the concentration of rights , the resolution of allocation issues and measures for the
In the short term , we need to learn more , we need to identify best practices and we need to study where rights-based managements systems have operated successfully in certain Member
- Madam President , I cannot say that I am altogether reassured by the Commissioner's response , because it seemed to me that , in what he was saying , he was actually
In the course of writing the report , for example , it occurred to me to ask just how compatible with one another the different ways of defining the extent of the
This in turn made me realise that , technical though a report on rights-based management might , on the face of it , seem , the issue it raises goes to the very

Meeting of the European Council of 14 and 15 December 2006 - Activities of the Finnish Presidency
statement by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council on the activities of the Finnish Presidency during its six-month term
President-in-Office of the Council
Council
A meeting of the European Council during Finland's Presidency was held in Brussels on 14 and 15 December
My purpose now is to report to you on its outcome
As Finland's six-month Presidency of the Council draws to a close , I also want to tell you what we have done for our Union during our term
Last Thursday at the European Council we offered President of the European Parliament , Josep Borrell , our sincerest thanks , now that his duties are almost over
I would like to thank him here once again for his dedicated efforts for the good of Europe
Mr President , it has been a pleasure working with you
We have achieved many good results , for which I thank you sincerely
Your work has been much appreciated
(Applause)
Here I would also like to thank the European Parliament for all its support and the combined efforts that it has made
Together , we have achieved some significant results
The Union's legislation on chemicals , the Reach Regulation , has finally been adopted
Consumers and industry have both been awaiting this legislation
We also adopted the Services Directive , thus creating the world's largest market in services
The seventh framework research programme , meanwhile , will lay the foundations for European competitiveness
At the start of the Finnish Presidency I said that the European Parliament was clearly becoming the place where European solutions are found for thorny , complex problems
That is still my firm belief and today I want to thank Parliament sincerely for its excellent levels of cooperation and express my appreciation for its work
In an increasingly politicised Europe , Parliament is a more important player than ever
The main themes at the December European Council were the EU's enlargement policy , justice and home affairs , and consolidation of the results of the informal summit in Lahti
Since the conclusions of the European Council are available to you , I am not going to explain them in any great detail
I just want to bring to your attention a few of the most crucial policy decisions
The European Council conducted a thorough and wide-ranging discussion of the EU's policy on enlargement , in line with the mandate given it by the June European Council
I wish here to reiterate one basic point: the Union's enlargement policy has been a huge success
The Union has succeeded in uniting Europe and overcoming the two-way split of the Cold War
Today , the EU is a proud and close union of 25 Member States - 27 from the beginning of next year
It is a pleasure to welcome Bulgaria and Romania as members of our European family
Turkey's membership was not on the European Council's agenda
The decisions concerning its accession process were taken at the General Affairs and External Relations Council preceding the European Council meeting
The EU is thus capable of making decisions
During its Presidency , Finland worked hard to find a solution that would have led to implementation of the protocol to the Ankara Agreement and direct trade with North Cyprus
We did not succeed in this and so we had to decide on measures relating to Turkey
The situation was clear: Turkey had not honoured its commitments and that has consequences
I want to stress , however , that Turkey is a country whose future is in the European Union
Turkey's accession process did not grind to a halt during the Finnish Presidency , nor was it shunted into a siding , to say nothing of the much predicted collision
The process may have slowed down for a while but the final destination is as before
The outcome of the European Council is that the Union remains open to new members
Enlargement will continue and those applicants that meet the demanding conditions set by the Union will be able to join
This open membership angle is essential to stability in Europe; it encourages reform in neighbouring countries as they progress along the European path
This incentive must not be taken away from them
One of the objectives which the Finnish Presidency set itself was to keep the EU's enlargement policy open and not close the door on deserving applicants
We succeeded in this
Our future is an ever-stronger and open Union
On the basis of the discussions we can emphasise that the Western Balkans' membership prospects are real
The region's future clearly lies in the EU
That is of fundamental importance to us
At the same time , obviously , the Union's enlargement policy must be respected
The counterweight to an open door policy is rigorous application of the conditions
There are no short cuts to EU membership
Membership is possible only when the membership criteria have been met
It was very important that there was no discussion of limits to Union enlargement , as there is no place for them
We cannot set up artificial barriers to the Union
Our real borders are not to be found on the map but in values
The construction of Europe is work in progress while there are still democratic black holes like Belarus so close by , which is a blot on the European landscape
We do not need places like that in Europe anymore
(Applause)
At the European Council , I gave an appraisal of the situation regarding the Constitutional Treaty
During our Presidency , we have had systematic discussions with all Member States concerning the Constitutional Treaty
you the general picture the Presidency got of the situation during the course of the consultations
The first thing to mention is the change in atmosphere that took place during our Presidency
When it started , people were still in a bit of a dream world
No one really wanted to give the Constitution active consideration
Now the Member States have started to think seriously about the future and many take the view that the Constitutional Treaty was actually a well thought-out and successful package
remains a well-balanced package
Upsetting the balance would cause more problems than it would solve
For that reason there is broad consensus that restarting negotiations as if there had been no Treaty is not possible
The institutional provisions in the Constitutional Treaty in particular are the result of long negotiations and deliberation
It is difficult to reopen talks without creating new problems
At the same time I want to say that my personal view is that picking the Treaty apart would be no more than an apparent solution at best
For example , we cannot separate Part I from Part III: the competences of the Union and of the Member States need to be clearly demarcated
Part II of the Constitutional Treaty , on the other hand , sets out the fundamental values on which the Union is based
I do not understand why they should be ignored
For now , 16 Member States have ratified the Treaty and at the start of next year there will be 18 of us
This is not a question , however , that can be resolved by force of numbers
The Constitutional Treaty will not enter into force unless it is endorsed by all 27 Member States
It would seem only reasonable to try and find a solution before 2009 when the next European Parliament elections are held and a new Commission appointed
The fact nevertheless remains that the Constitutional Treaty is still on hold and that soon we will be handing the baton on to Germany
We are looking to the German Presidency to take this difficult issue forward
At the same time , though , it is important that we use whatever practical means are available to us to push ahead with European cooperation
Justice and home affairs are one outstanding example of this
Our citizens expect concrete action to improve security and justice
Justice and home affairs , however , is beset by a serious problem
The requirement of unanimity in police and criminal matters prevents genuine progress from being made in cooperation: cooperation which is important to our citizens
They are entitled to expect more effective collaboration in improving security and combating crime
At present , however , decisions on cooperation are either watered down or cannot be made at all , as we saw just recently with regard to the transfer of detainees
The requirement of unanimity is a barrier to justice and home affairs and hinders real progress
unanimously to switch to qualified-majority voting
number of Member States opposed it
This avenue has been closed to us , therefore
along with the principles set out in the Constitutional Treaty , and that means switching to qualified majority voting
This is a major breakthrough , which we are pleased with
Future Presidencies , furthermore , should honour this decision
would be to increase substantially the number of decisions taken by qualified majority
It is without question the most effective , the fairest and indeed the best way of arriving at good decisions
The unanimity requirement does not serve European common interests in any but the most critical of matters
The European Council held in-depth discussions on the Union's immigration policy
It is in a spirit of solidarity that we all remember the problems that the Mediterranean Member States faced in the summer
The Finnish Presidency actively addressed the challenges of illegal immigration and the matter was discussed at the extraordinary summit in Lahti
This time , at the December European Council , we agreed on a comprehensive approach to both legal and illegal migration and we acknowledged the complexity of the issue
Immigration is not primarily and only a question of better border controls
Equally crucial are developments in the countries of departure , transit issues and a controlled immigration policy , which the EU so badly needs on account of its own ageing population
Europe is not some remote island
The European Council also endorsed the important results of the informal summit in Lahti
We all agree that Europe needs a more focused innovation policy
We cannot maintain our current levels of prosperity unless we are genuinely competitive in the future and cultivate our capacity for skills
A significant feature of the Finnish presidential term has been that innovation has been at the very centre of competition policy
Promoting innovation must be an integral part of the EU's competition strategy
Now that the groundwork has been done , we expect the spring European Council to formulate some forward-looking innovation-policy guidelines
manage climate change
These themes have attracted a growing amount of attention during the Finnish Presidency
At the same time they were among the most important areas of cooperation discussed this autumn with Russia , the United States and our Asian partners
during the German Presidency , at which these issues will be high on the agenda
On Friday , I received some direct feedback from the press
They thought that this European Council was boring , that the decisions lacked drama and that there were no last-minute solutions hammered out in the dead of night
it
Europe needs tangible results , not contrived political drama
(Applause)
I am convinced that a Europe of results , as Commission President Barrroso so often emphasises , is the best way to take the Union forward
We need practical solutions of benefit to our citizens
Only that way can we build the sort of legitimate structure on which major solutions like the Constitutional Treaty can rest
Mr President , there are 13 days remaining of the Finnish Presidency
We will do our duty until the last minute
One important theme during our term has been to strengthen the unity of the Union
We will not cope in world affairs unless we can be more united in our external relations
In the early days of Finland's Presidency we experienced a serious crisis in the Middle East , culminating in a serious war-like situation in Lebanon
most crucially , was able to mobilise troops , which was decisive for the success of a sufficiently strong UN operation in Lebanon
The summer in Lebanon was a testing time but the Union came through the crisis laudably
And I would like to say thank you here once again to all the Member States for the support which the Presidency received in trying to resolve this matter
better world
Since enlargement the Union has moved into the leading position in the world on a number of counts and we must take full advantage of this
like the EU
One of the priorities we set was to consolidate the EU's policy on Russia
Here too , the practical importance of a united policy is very much in evidence
At the informal summit in Lahti , we had a good discussion with the Russian President , Mr Putin , and the EU was able to speak with one voice to Russia
Russia is clearly an important partner for the EU
A glance at the map is enough to see that
that worry us
I am not persuaded that Russia is heading in the right direction
We need to see a firmer commitment to democracy , the rule of law and the market economy
We do not want Russia to go in an authoritarian direction
We are fully entitled to be concerned about developments in Russia
Russia is an acid test of the EU's unity
Finland would like to have reached agreement on starting negotiations on a new and comprehensive agreement with Russia
For reasons that are well known , that agreement has not been reached up till now
I think that the new agreement provides an excellent illustration of the problem we face
We need a strong joint agreement which incorporates the main basis for cooperation between us , values , and which provides a lasting foundation for trade and energy cooperation
If no common agreement is possible , a regrettable and short-sighted option is a network of bilateral agreements that would enable Russia to treat different Member States in different ways
Some will get good agreements , some will get bad ones , and some may get none at all
Yet it goes without saying that a united EU is such an important partner for Russia that it can , as one single entity , negotiate a decent agreement
Just how united is Europe if we are competing amongst ourselves to see who can get the best terms
That is not what European solidarity is about
Presidencies start with big goals , but real life brings us all back down to earth
We have achieved a great deal but many crucial matters have been left unresolved
Finland worked hard for a decision on amending the Working Time Directive and I think we got pretty close
It was not enough , however
The problem has not gone away of course and I wish subsequent presidencies every success in finding a solution to this European issue
I am rather sad that this is the last time that I will be representing the Finnish Presidency at a plenary session of Parliament
endeavours
I believe that Europe has a common future: a more united Europe where border fences will vanish
I am particularly pleased that we achieved a result on Schengen enlargement
That is the kind of practical progress that Europe's citizens expect from us as decision-makers
Once again I want to thank the European Parliament sincerely for its excellent show of cooperation
(Applause)
Thank you very much , Mr Vanhanen
Minister , Mrs Lehtom√§ki
the Services Directive
Thank you all
President of the Commission
Mr President , last week's European Council was an important demonstration that Europe is moving decisively forward for results
It showed a Europe of consensus and progress , the right kind of Europe to build for the future
Prime Minister Vanhanen has given you a comprehensive overview of the results of the Summit , to which I fully subscribe
The issues addressed - enlargement , immigration , innovation , climate change - are all long-term issues which require determined , ambitious , persistent action at the highest level
They are not one-minute wonders which hit the headlines for a day and then fade away
The momentum and focus which the European Council can provide is central to their success
that is concentrated on delivery
policy agenda we have today
Another requirement for making this work is partnership
The achievements of the past year are generally shared achievements of the Council , the Parliament and the Commission
I would like to underline the contribution of the European Parliament
defending the European Parliament in a responsible and constructive way , taking the approach of a good partnership with the Council and Commission
I think the past year has seen a new phase in the way the European Union operates
We have got away from the idea of the Union as a zero-sum power game
On a whole series of dossiers the past year has shown that this is not how the European Union works
It works through a constructive exchange between a unique mix of institutions producing , hopefully , a win-win situation for everybody
much less on Brussels turf wars
I think that we can learn some lessons here as we deepen the debate over the future of Europe next year
Today I would like to concentrate on three areas concerning the European Council
Firstly , on what I call a renewed consensus on enlargement
Europe is not enlarging by default
There is a common understanding that we need to combine the strategic vision of enlargement - our open Europe - with the capacity of integration of the European Union
public consent
the aspirations of the Western Balkans
This was clearly underlined during the European Council meeting
It also helps to remind us why , with the right preparation , enlargement is a win-win policy , making Europe stronger , more prosperous and more successful internally and globally
I am glad that the European Commission was able to provide the European Council with the right groundwork to make this consensus possible
Secondly , in the area of migration the European Council successfully translated common concerns into common action
We have taken real steps to help prevent and address the crisis we saw this autumn
In particular European Union leaders recognise that it was not enough to manage the problem
They acknowledge , rather , that it had to be tackled at source with a new emphasis on development
I am particularly happy that the Council agreed to the European Union Africa Summit next year , which will provide an excellent platform for dialogue
But we should not need the personal tragedies we saw on our television screens this autumn to spur us into change
We need to give ourselves the right tools to save lives , fight terrorism and tackle crime
It is true that we would have liked the European Council to have gone further in the streamlining of the decision-making process in the area of justice and home affairs
of the passerelle clause that is possible under the current Treaties
that area
Thirdly , on innovation , I am also pleased to have the support of the Member States for our proposals on innovation and the European Institute of Technology
coming months
Concluding next year would mean that the European Institute of Technology could start its work in 2008
This should be our common goal
that concrete projects are a way to fulfil the EU-grade projects
research , which I have just mentioned , and the Globalisation Fund which was also approved , not to mention the very important cohesion agenda
citizens
On the economy we have had four quarters of significant growth in jobs this year
The fruits of economic reform are starting to be felt , but we should not sit back
Last week's annual progress report on the Lisbon Strategy showed how much is to be gained from pressing on with the commitments made in the national reform programmes
On energy and climate change , the Commission is now finalising its proposals and we have received a clear signal from the European Council
citizens will not thank the European Union for timidity in this matter
The scale of the challenge demands a credible and ambitious response
Finally , on external policy , we are starting to see the fruits of a new coherence and determination in that policy
Siberian overflight issue - the past six months have seen the European Union showing the right mix of political , economic and aid policies
The result has been a positive European contribution to global issues
While we recognise that a lot more has to be done , it is fair to acknowledge that some progress has been achieved
Last June we agreed our twin-track strategy of a Europe of results
At the European Council meeting we recognised that this kind of policy is going in the right direction
We made this a natural way to progress on the future of Europe and hopefully on the settlement of the constitutional question
We have to say once again that the Europe of the future cannot be built with the tools of the past
We cannot fulfil all our ambitions for Europe and concrete results for citizens with the tools and instruments of the past
We need the democracy and efficiency offered by the Constitutional Treaty
precise questions with Member States in order to determine the room for manoeuvre and the best time for making progress
institutional reform
The report made by Prime Minister Vanhanen to the European Council was a very important contribution to the work that should now continue under the German Presidency
The European Union is well placed to take a decisive step forward in 2007
Let us show that we are up to the challenge
for their very serious , very committed and very energetic contribution to the progress of Europe
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group
on his Presidency on behalf of our group
at the helm of the EU has done us a power of good
We should like to see all the subsequent Presidencies showing this kind of goodwill
I should like to congratulate him on his commitment to our common cause - Europe
Several successes have been achieved during his Council Presidency
have also worked on the Services Directive - as they have on REACH and the Seventh Research Framework Programme
more
The President-in-Office has described our difficult relations with Russia
This is indeed a difficult partnership , but we affirm that it must remain a partnership
We also affirm that we do not want to secure our energy supply at the expense of our human rights
We want both
We need orderly relations with Russia , and we shall continue in our role as human-rights lawyer in that country , in Europe and worldwide
On no account should we entertain the idea of bilateral treaties between EU Member States and Russia; there can be only a joint agreement between the EU and Russia
This has to be made clear
(Applause)
In the matter of Turkey , the President-in-Office of the Council has found a compromise solution that is good considering the circumstances
On behalf of our group , I can state most firmly that we want a partnership and , if possible , friendship with Turkey
Turkey is an important country
We do not want a collision or clash with Turkey
We are partners and also friends
one
A number of clarifications have been made within neighbourhood policy
We have to understand that it is not possible for all the countries with a European outlook to join the EU
Nevertheless , we affirm that we want good neighbourly relations
The neighbourhood instrument for the countries to the south and east of the EU has been adopted , which represents a great success
The Development Cooperation Instrument for the countries of Asia and Latin America has also been adopted
In addition , the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights , in particular , provides us with the opportunity of acting without the agreement of the countries concerned
That will enable us to support democracy and human rights worldwide , including financially
I believe that these are very positive developments
The Constitution has featured in the comments of both the President-in-Office and the Commission President
Constitutional Treaty , the reforms , and also the common values that link us
indicator of our will to lead the EU towards a better future
Immigration has been mentioned
to opening our eyes to the poverty and concerns of the countries south of our borders
gain in intensity at the EU-Africa Summit - I believe this will be a step in the right direction
Finally , allow me to say a few words of a more personal nature
Last week , the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats decided to elect a new chairman on 9 January
This means that , after seven-and-a-half years , or 90 months , this will be my last speech as Chairman of this great - and sometimes difficult - group
Of course , this is also true of the other groups
so today on my own behalf
The cooperation I have enjoyed with President Borrell has been constant
It has also been very sincere and - I say this from my point of view and hope he can confirm it - very friendly throughout
I should like to give him my sincere thanks for this
I should also like to say a word of thanks to my fellow Members
have enjoyed with him
This has always been based on professionalism , oriented towards our common convictions , where such exist - we have diverging convictions , too , of course
Above all , I should like to thank him for the mutual trust that underpins our relationship
with his predecessor Mr Cox
I wish to thank Mr Crowley , with whom I have always enjoyed a relationship of profound trust
Parliament
Mr Wurtz , even though our opinions differ on many issues , we have nevertheless been fellow Members in this House since 1979
Our cooperation has been characterised by mutual respect throughout , for which I am obliged to him
Common ground has always existed with Mrs Frassoni , Mr Cohn-Bendit and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance on the issue of human rights
be said
representation
By way of conclusion , I should like to say a few words to the Commission
Mr Commission President , the formation of the present Commission was the toughest period of my political life - but that is now in the past
I am glad that , under the leadership of the Commission President , the Commission has found its feet and is doing an impressive job
Even though the Commission and Parliament have different roles , we nevertheless have a common goal , namely an EU that is strong and capable of action
President Borrell , by way of conclusion , allow me to make a request , which I address to the political groups , the Chairmen and this House
Let us show respect throughout our meetings here and in all our dealings with the other institutions
Mutual respect establishes trust and , in turn , this trust benefits Europe
of law
This is a new element in the 21st century
I am convinced that , with this respect , this trust , the EU will develop to the benefit of our values and interests , both internally and externally
(Sustained applause)
Thank you for your speech , Mr Poettering , and for your words
the other speeches
on behalf of the PSE Group
good thing , and I should like to join them in doing so
I am much obliged to Mr Vanhanen of the Finnish Council Presidency , who I agree has done a good job
Considering the circumstances under which the Finnish Presidency had to take leadership of the EU , I would even say he has done a very good job
I also share Mr Vanhanen's view that the fact that journalists describe a summit as 'boring' does not necessarily make it a bad one
on the boredom or joy it imparted to journalists
I shall list two positive points
This Summit sent out the clear message that Europe does admit its responsibility with regard to enlargement
The enlargement process entails a responsibility on our part
In the Balkans , in particular , prospective accession has had - and continues to have - a peacemaking effect
of the constitutional process
This was that there will be no enlargement without the necessary reform of the EU
that Europe could function effectively , and meet popular expectations in the countries wishing to join the EU , on the basis of the existing treaty structures , has been reduced to absurdity
Anyone in favour of enlargement , therefore - as the means to meet people's needs and make peace - needs a Europe that functions effectively
my group , but with the constitutional reforms there shall be
(Applause)
for the coming years
immigration is a very positive signal
'At long last ,' it has to be said
been rightly pointed out , is not being used
not make me very credible
In that respect , this was not a boring Summit , but instead yet another wasted opportunity
if we want to manage migration , we have to provide the EU with the legal armoury it needs to actually carry this out
As all the speakers have now mentioned , Parliament , together with the Finnish Presidency , has brought to a conclusion two important legislative procedures that point the way ahead
My group considers the Services Directive one of the greatest successes to date in terms of shaping the internal market
A destructive neoliberal concept has been turned into socially responsible legislation
The second concerns chemicals policy
At the reception , I noticed representatives of the chemicals industry drinking sparkling wine with representatives of Greenpeace - so it cannot be such a bad piece of legislation
sense and consumer rights
this great achievement by Parliament under the leadership of our group
(Applause)
end
I do not want to address all the other Group Chairmen - I shall address him and him alone
We have indeed enjoyed extremely constructive , collegial cooperation , for which I am obliged to him
I should also like to pay Mr Poettering a great compliment
I have to say that he is an extremely skilled politician - something I should like to illustrate with a little example from this morning
Two-and-a-half years on , no one now remarks upon the wording of the phrase 'speaking for the EPP component of our group'
Of course , the group is called the PPE-DE Group , and this phrasing implies that a whole section of his group is not even given the chance to speak
After all , these are really two political groups , and the PPE component always says the opposite of what the ED part says
In this respect , Mr Poettering has actually managed to be the Chairman of two groups without anyone noticing
That is what I call political skill , and I compliment Mr Poettering on it
(Laughter and applause)
Ladies and gentlemen , a man of this calibre is capable of greater things - just wait and see
I am much obliged to him for the cooperation we have enjoyed
with him , be annoyed with him or share one's happiness with him , but the fact always remains that one will never be misled by him
He speaks clearly and is above all reliable
In my opinion , these virtues are rare in politics and , the further one progresses in one's political career , the rarer they become
When a politician has reached such a high level and has held on to them so tightly , he deserves thanks , recognition and best wishes
(Applause)
I have not yet finished with the festive proceedings
thank him and the Secretary-General for the fantastic job Parliament's services have done again this year
We would not be able to do our jobs if it were not for the truly qualified and , above all , collegial and humanly impeccable input from Parliament's services
I think that a few words should be addressed to the people I consider the true heroes of Parliament , namely the ladies and gentlemen behind the glass
In my opinion , Parliament's interpreters do an outstanding job , a job without which this Parliament would be inconceivable
(Applause)
I am grateful to one and all that I have finally been allowed to speak for eight-and-a-half minutes
I am much obliged to the President
(Laughter)
It is certainly rare for us to have so much time available in the European Parliament
We should not abuse it
on behalf of the ALDE Group
- Mr President , the Monty Python team once very uncharitably described Finland as a poor second to Belgium when going abroad
Prime Minister , you and your government have shown that Finland is a poor second to none when it comes to running a European Union Presidency
Thank you for your work in bringing Europe closer to its citizens
Following on from the comitology agreement with the Austrians , you have opened legislation to public scrutiny
I believe that 86% of legislative decisions under your Presidency have been taken in public: a total of 90 decisions compared with only 17 last year
that we can see how Member States put into national law decisions taken at European level and make a fair comparison
the Socialist rapporteur's amendments , an agreement on next year's budget and an agreement to bring Bulgaria and Romania into our Union
concrete results'
with the existing decision-making procedures and that the framework needs to be strengthened
I hope the German Presidency will get agreement on Article 42
We cannot wait for a new Treaty and our message to Chancellor Merkel must be: Europa muss handlungsf√§hig sein
Justice and home affairs is just one example of where such progress is needed
We have talked a lot about migratory flows
Hitherto , too much of the focus has been on security and too little on the economic or humanitarian aspects of these flows
policy opening up the front door a little , in order better to close the back door to illegal migration
More work is needed on illegal migration
It is no good just to have a rapid enhancement of Frontex or permanent coastal patrols
They are only part of the answer
We need to know why people are coming
people would be moving out of Sudan
Palestine , Lebanon , Afghanistan
Unless we are able to provide security and good government and life chances for people there , they will continue to move
It is no coincidence that some of these countries are the countries of origin of the greatest numbers heading towards our shores
Perhaps the most important outcome of the Summit is paragraph 5: a strong statement on how enlargement has been a success
Clearly if one looks at the Eurobarometer published last week , that message has not got through to our citizens
constitutional arrangements in place
If leadership is needed on enlargement it is needed , too , in ending the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots
On reading the sections in the Presidency Conclusions we see too much leadership has been left to the United States
We are particularly concerned about the Eurojust arrangements signed with the USA
Perhaps if we had the passerelle in foreign and security policy , we would be able to promote European values further and better
hope , by the clatter of reindeer hooves
Mr Poettering has given his final speech to this House
He has been a fair , frank , and I am pleased to say federalist companion
The European Parliament needs an ideological majority rather than a gro√üe Koalition
We were pleased to work with him in an ideological majority for a while
He will find that this
(DE) empty togetherness is nothing but accompanied loneliness
Nonetheless , we wish him all the best for the future , whatever he ends up doing
(Laughter and applause)
Thank you , Mr Watson
I see that we have all been touched by the Christmas spirit
on behalf of the UEN Group
- Mr President , I also wish to join my colleagues in thanking Prime Minister Vanhanen for the work of the Finnish Presidency
here in Parliament and has been most attentive and engaging at all times
Several things immediately strike me with regard to the Summit
Firstly , as the Prime Minister pointed out , there were no serious headlines highlighting a split or a division amongst the Member States of the European Union
a spin on why the failure happened , to blame somebody else
Therefore there is success concerning the decisions that have been taken
That success is predicated under four Cs: consistency , coordination , cooperation and consensus
try to do is going to make that happen
different areas
However , it is a mistake to speak of bringing in tax harmonisation through a back door , when it is clearly not within the powers in the Treaties
out the wrong signals with regard to what the European Union should be about
One of the major successes in the Council's Conclusions has been the idea of solidarity amongst the Member States concerning our dealings with Russia
there is a collective agreement amongst the Member States not to give in to that kind of negotiation
certain areas
at the core reasons why immigration takes place and why there is so much illegal immigration
horror or danger to themselves
respond and to react
country to speak for them and , in fact , have been let down not just by the European Union and the US but by the United Nations itself
Our resolve for 2007 should be to ensure that we will never see that occur again
we are understood
To make sense of what Mr Schulz has to say is even more important , and I appreciate that from them as well
greater heights
(Applause)
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group
the series of incidents observed in recent months in various European locations , which have been passed over in total silence
perplexed
What are we talking about
With regard to the issue of immigration , the previous Finnish Presidency achieved considerably more significant results in Tampere
our citizens
drafted , and that we will obviously have to look for alliances , within and outside the European Institutions , in order to be able to resolve the major problem of institutional reform
of the island , and today we are inheriting this failure to reach a solution by the European Union as a whole
Therefore , quite frankly I can see nothing particularly new or specific
Am I happy with this situation
No , I am not happy , but nonetheless I can see the need for transparency , with respect to our citizens too
give the Balkan countries an unambiguous prospect of accession
way , placing an obstacle in the way of enlargement
We cannot accept it , because it is not the case and should not be the case
Mr President , before thanking Mr Poettering I would like to touch on one final point , which has to do with relations with Russia
as independent as possible , which means reducing our consumption by 30% and promoting renewable energy with even greater conviction
Otherwise , we will always be dependent , if not on Russia then on another country
well together
to be seen - and to express , as well , the wish that he will still be able to fight for Europe , because this Parliament truly has need of champions
varying degrees of support from his troops
certain emphasis that is a little too close to a religion , which benefits neither Europe nor Parliament
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
- (DE) Mr President , as this is the last plenary joint debate of the year , I too wish to take the opportunity to express my thanks
us have enjoyed
I should also like to thank the Secretariat , Mr Priestley and all Parliament's staff for their truly excellent joint work
We all know how difficult it can be at times for this Parliament to really function as well as we should all like
I should also like to address Mr Poettering , including on behalf of my Group Chairman Mr Wurtz personally , as he has not been allocated any speaking time today
Mr Poettering belongs to a different political group , but I think that that is a good thing
It stimulates the exchange of opinions and is important for democracy
It is also important , however , to be able to cooperate constructively across the group divide - and we have done so in recent years
next opportunity to underline this publicly in person
I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for the Finnish Council Presidency , and for the constructive cooperation there has been between the Presidency and Parliament
set in motion during the Finnish Presidency - the Services Directive and REACH - as they stand
move away from neoliberal policies , and , as we see it , the Directives are certainly not masterpieces
(Applause)
to honour the commitments we have made to the countries participating in the enlargement process
membership of the EU
It is my personal conviction that the Treaty of Nice in force is not a suitable basis for future enlargement
of the Union of 27
The candidate countries are not the only ones who have to change; the Union itself , first and foremost , has to do its homework
From my point of view , this entails finding a universally accepted way out of the constitutional crisis during the German Council Presidency
of reflection will also entail consequences for other aspects of politics
Advertising brochures will be no help to us there
The people must be able to associate their personal vision for the future for themselves and their families with Europe once again
Work and social security - this is what they expect from Europe
Decent working conditions , genuinely equal opportunities in education and careers , protection in case of illness , a guaranteed minimum income - all of this counts
To the President of the Commission I say that this would really be a Europe of results
people's everyday experiences , Europe will continue to lose support
political priority
(Applause)
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group
- Mr President , my congratulations to Mr Vanhanen and the Finnish Presidency
You have passed the test
opinion poll only one in four of your population supported that course of action
So Mr Barroso must be very pleased with you
Your Presidency sums up the whole EU project: an exercise in political dishonesty , where the views of ordinary people count for very little
Well , the Constitution may be dead , but its contents most certainly are not and your Presidency Conclusions talk about the need for further enlargement
Under justice and home affairs you - and we heard Mr Barroso earlier - talk about the need to improve decision-making
Well , that word means more power for the European Union
You praise the idea of a common energy policy and increasing activism in foreign affairs
Carry on regardless
are
It is now clear that the plan is to come back with a new treaty
You are going to drop the dreaded C word
Will the French and Dutch be asked to vote again
No , of course they will not
with taxpayers' money to bully those small countries into submission
In Britain it will not wash
We have already gone a treaty too far and the voice of the people will be heard
We have seen this morning in this EU Parliament self-congratulation and backslapping
You all ought to be very thankful that the proceedings in this Chamber get so little press coverage
I think the general public of Europe would be appalled
Thank you , and a happy Christmas to everybody
(Laughter)
British humour
(NL) Mr President , like Mr Farage , I fear that I too will shatter the overworked consensus that was mentioned a moment ago
Failed European summits are starting to become one of our traditions
These failures are always eventually wrapped in fine euphemisms in order not to hurt the presidency's feelings too much
This summit , though , about the enlargement strategy - which is suddenly being taken down a gear - has been yet another complete waste of time
press and the Armenian question , should result in the negotiations being brought to a permanent halt rather than a merely temporary one
in the freedom of press and domestic politics of other Member States
What a travesty
of Flanders , located at the heart of Europe , must not become an independent Member State of the EU , as we found out last week
public television station RTBF broadcast last Wednesday about the scenario of Flemish independence , something that Europe apparently cannot tolerate
So the Flemings know where they stand with these Heads of State or Government
After all , Mr Juncker and his colleagues have decreed , without tolerating any opposition , that the Belgian monarchy must be sustained
Nobody else has a say
that they can interfere in the freedom of press in a Member State and ignore the will of the Flemings
This will of the Flemings , however , is very democratic and legitimate
Flanders wants to be freed from the Socialist Party's corrupt dictatorship in Wallonia and from the dastardly royal offspring of the House of Saxe-Coburg
Like the Czechs and Slovaks , we want to avail ourselves of the right to self-determination
It is not the European Heads of State who should dictate to Flanders when it comes to how it should address the future
Thank you very much , Mr Dillen
That brings to an end the speeches by the Group spokespersons
We will now hear from the individual Members who have requested the floor
Mr President , thank you for that pronunciation
Stubb turns to 'Stub' and I think that next year it will be 'Schtub' , so it is all going in the right direction
I have three brief points to make
Firstly , I would like to thank and congratulate the Finnish Presidency , especially four Ministers , and then a group of people
job; and then there is one Minister who is absent , Mr Pekkarinen
Most of all I would like to thank the civil servants , especially Ambassador Eikka Kosonen
We all know that the machinery does not work without the civil service
and Schengen
I think you did a very good job on that
I should like to say to Mr Schulz that the last person I want lecturing me on the Services Directive is a German Socialist
As regards alcohol tax , I think there is a minus , but as a consumer I do not really mind the fact that you failed to raise alcohol tax
To finish off , I would like to say that the Finnish Presidency was cool , calm and collected
If you could personify things , I would say that you , Mrs Lehtom√§ki , were Mrs Cool
Mr Vanhanen , you were Mr Calm , and I think you , Mr Tuomioja , were Mr Collected
(Applause)
(PT) I should like to congratulate the Finnish Presidency on the calmness with which it performed its duties , which was the right approach given the tension around the world
these issues to the fore
of elections being brought forward
relations between Europe and Africa
(FR) Presidents of the three institutions , I am going to concentrate solely on the re-launch of the constitutional process
A few days ago I sent you a document which , as the Finnish Presidency has said , shows that the package cannot be reopened , which is a good thing
not; that will be a much more complicated exercise than simply separating the first and second parts from the rest
The third aspect of what I propose relates to the means of validating this 'thing'
It will have to be put before the European citizens again , and why not do it transnationally , as Parliament says , holding a referendum everywhere on the same day
Member States and parliaments , but certainly not 100%
Populations and future generations cannot be taken hostage
I think that is a basis on which things can develop in the days ahead
They will move very quickly
On 26 January , the 'yes' countries will be meeting in Madrid
Ten days later , the 'no' countries , acknowledged or presumed , will be meeting in Luxembourg
For pity's sake , do all you can to get these things moving
Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking the Finnish Presidency
As a representative from a neighbouring country , I am proud to be a neighbour to Finland these days
You have achieved a lot and have shown that Europe is moving
That is important because all the things we have discussed this morning show that we are able to move Europe forward
face globalisation or the need to do something about the developments in Iran
All these discussions result from the fact that we are able to take a higher degree of responsibility than ever before
When we are discussing the new challenges from countries applying to join the Union , that is a result of achievements and success , not of the failure , Mr Farage
If we had failed no one would want to be a member of this Union and now they want to be members of this Union because of our success
We have more steps to take
A credible Union needs a credible common foreign and security policy
Happy Christmas , Mr President
Thank you very much , and the same to you , Mr H√∂kmark
with REACH and the Services Directive
They are all important issues
I especially appreciate the trouble that was gone to over cooperation with Russia
and we have to begin to act accordingly in the wake of it
Perhaps the only negative issue is idealism over enlargement , which is troubling the Finnish Government
For six months Turkey has shown how difficult things get if we move forward too fast
We really need to insist that terms and conditions are met , and we should give them sufficient time
Prime Minister , you are wrong when you say that there should not be any barriers
The public expects us to have a vision of how large Europe will be in 10 to 20 years' time
Our citizens would rather have a small Europe that works than one which is too large and which functions poorly
(Applause)
large Member States have their own problems
Finland has been praised for establishing an excellent working atmosphere , and this way such hard compromises as the Services Directive and the chemicals regulation were achieved
comes to the big issues
The governments of all Member States need to pay more attention to this when they discuss issues with their own national parliaments
their economies grow healthier
It seems appropriate to hope that Germany will not put the brakes on enlargement policy
So far all enlargements have been economic and political successes
(PL) Mr President , I would like to thank the Finnish Presidency , above all for the way it dealt with the highly delicate strategic partnership with Russia
the same time putting some pressure on the country to respect human rights and democracy at home
The presidency's second achievement is the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union
And I would also like to congratulate it for ratifying the European Constitution
also opening the European Union to the outside world
(NL) Mr President , I should first of all like to thank the Finnish Presidency for its good cooperation with regard to the development instrument
way in which we managed to get this off the ground
I have two questions
watch as these human rights violations in Darfur get worse and worse , without being able to respond effectively
I would again ask you to consider the possibility of a special UN initiative and of the promotion of others of the kind
Secondly , as for enlargement , you are in favour of it but at the same time prescribe requirements with regard to the Treaty
Make up your mind
Why not say that we should first be more democratic and more effective before we can enlarge
We are keen to enlarge , but we need these requirements
Be clear and show leadership , otherwise we will remain stuck in this sneaky and slippery way of going about things , which is hardly effective
(FR) Mr President , the Finnish Presidency told us we needed a Europe of results
able to show that it had real political vision and that it was not a rubber-stamp chamber
I will mention the Services Directive , REACH , etc
On Turkey , you told us that Turkey's accession process was only slowed down
You tell us the European Union's borders are set by our values , but our values are universal and we cannot take in everyone
Do we want a European Europe or an Asian Europe
President Barroso referred to the European Union's integration capacity , saying it was essential
Geographical borders do need to be defined , because Europe will not be built without the agreement of the European nations
want to do with that immigration policy
Some are opening their borders wide; others , on the other hand , want to develop agreements with the developing countries
The German Presidency will therefore have a tremendous amount of work to do; I wish it good luck
(NL) Mr President , I too am indebted to the Finnish Presidency
I have a question in connection with relations with Russia
Trade , especially agricultural trade , is currently experiencing major problems as a result of veterinary or phytosanitary objections
intend to resolve this
(PL) Mr President , I would like to thank the House for this debate
We have now achieved a wonderful compromise and consensus , which is praiseworthy , particularly if this atmosphere can rub off on certain national parliaments
I do , however , have one doubt and one word of warning: the statements of some leaders contain a sort of intellectual blackmail which I do not like at all
Some of them say that institutional reform is a condition of further enlargement
decided whether or not to carry out institutional reform
road to accession
(FI) Mr President , during its presidential term , Finland promoted qualified majority decisions on third pillar issues by means of the passerelle clauses
The historical notion that nations have had of right and wrong , however , is only written into national laws , and that constitutes the legitimacy of societies
EU laws are synthetic laws used in matters of justice for half a billion people
They are compromises which no one originally wanted
They eat away at the EU's legitimacy , as does the Constitutional Treaty still under discussion , which requires unanimity for it to be adopted
It requires unanimity , and because that has not happened , it is defunct as a consequence
When it comes to the Constitution , Finland has acted as a minesweeper for Germany and the next presidency
Unfortunately , during its term the Finnish Presidency has not made the legitimacy of the EU any stronger in the eyes of its citizens
It has just photocopied the message of the elite to the people
Mr President , the strongest statement that the President-in-Office made in his speech was in advocating more communitarian-friendly procedures
best and most effective way to govern the European Union , that was the best part of your speech
This also makes it clear that rotating presidencies still have some meaning in the European Union
At least it keeps the Member States better committed to the European Union and its common policies
I should also like to say to those who said that Turkey's accession talks will slow down that this will not happen
Of the 35 negotiating chapters , only eight are closed , which is a very good result for the Finnish Presidency
Twenty-seven chapters are still open to advancement and going forward
In fact , Turkey's accession talks will be much improved as a result of this excellent Finnish Presidency
I can only echo what my colleagues have already said
(Applause)
- (PL) Mr President , almost everything that can be said , has been said
It was a good presidency and we are grateful for it
Despite the impasse on the constitutional process , there has been progress - 'Europe on the move'
An example is the adoption of 'Schengen for all'
This is extremely important for the new Member States
the lurch
President Barroso deserves particular thanks here
and economic selfishness
One further point: I am dissatisfied by the reduction of eastern policy to the northern and Russian dimension , to the exclusion of the issues of Ukraine and Belarus
(ET) I would like to talk about Russia
According to the European Union's official position , the blockade of Polish meat products in Russia is a bilateral matter in which Brussels will not intervene
The EU uses the same pretext to avoid demanding Russia ratify the Estonian-Russian Border Treaty
The Kremlin eagerly supports this foolish behaviour
Now Russia is blockading all food imports from the European Union at most border crossing points
Russia's next well-considered step was to offer the five leading exporters bilateral agreements for food exporting
Absurd
Russia understands the European Union inside out
Russia is putting our agricultural policy and solidarity to the test
As Mr Vanhanen correctly said: 'We must open our eyes about Russia
' In the Putin era Russia is led by people for whom the Cold War was their life and work
As was the case with that conflict , Europe will emerge triumphant only if it remains true to its core values , democracy and human rights
I wish the new president luck
(FI) Mr President , I also wish to express my appreciation of the Finnish Presidency in just a few words
There have been quite a few speeches here appraising the term and its success
These are six-month presidencies , and as such they are perhaps difficult to judge purely quantitatively
Thinking qualitatively , however , I can say that Finland has done well in legislative projects and taken them forward
We made headway on REACH , the Services Directive , the seventh framework research programme , and so on
Let me say that , as a Finn , I have been especially happy that our ministers have been here on frequent occasions , in particular Minister Lehtom√§ki
This shows that Finland is keen to get to grips with these issues , become involved , and bring its own skills and know-how to joint European decision-making
So I might say that this Presidency
(The President cut off the speaker)
(PL) Mr President , as far as external policy is concerned , the European Union has shown its weakness by not having a single standpoint
actors of the European institutions success in 2007
(ES) Mr President , as your mandate is drawing to an end , I would like to thank you for your visits to Poland
I would like such visits to become a tradition of this House
of the Europe of Fifteen
Thank you very much , Mr Zaleski , and congratulations on your perfect command of Spanish
It is an incentive for me to try to learn your language
You are a fluent Spanish speaker
Mr President , I rise if only to show that not all Brits agree with the somewhat eccentric views expressed by Mr Farage just now
Monsieur Farage claims that it is somehow wrong for the Presidency - any Presidency presumably - to try to find a solution to the Constitutional Treaty
In his argument he says that the people have said no
Yet he only wants to listen to the answer that suits him
He only wants to listen to those who have said no
He fails to recognise that 18 Member States have said yes , even where a referendum was held
If you add them all together , more people have said yes than have voted no , so it is right to persevere and find a compromise
That compromise must take account of the views of those who said no , but it must also take account of the large majority who have said yes
(Applause)
(EL) Mr President , I shall confine myself to the reference which the President-in-Office of the Council made to the issue of enlargement , especially as far as Turkey is concerned
If the translation I heard was correct , I would ask him to correct the reference which he made to 'Northern Cyprus'
soldiers of the occupying force in this area of Cyprus
Mr President , Europe will gain the support of its citizens by coming up with practical initiatives that respond to what they expect from us
I particularly thank them
and economic growth , which is what the Services Directive will do
However , I want to make a plea to you , Prime Minister , in your role as a continuing member of the Council
Those directives that you got through will be effective only if the Member States do their job properly and if they transpose them quickly and effectively
Will you guarantee to put them on the agenda at Council level to ensure that your work is not wasted by ineffective and inefficient work by member governments
with Russia , would make the effort to resolve two issues that are important for the European Union as a whole
import of food products to Russia
Unfortunately in December 2006 there has been little progress on either issue
the problem into one that affects all Member States
I hope that the Germany presidency will act quickly to resolve these two issues
Mr President , I want to welcome the Summit Conclusions on immigration
They take us one step closer to a more balanced immigration policy and one based on solidarity
For far too long we have been focusing on long-term measures in the hope that we would solve immigration problems through development policy
of illegal immigration
Today we see that the entire burden is on the southern Member States , which are simply inundated by the incessant flow of illegal immigration
Therefore , the Summit Conclusions in this respect take us one step further because they include a series of concrete steps in this regard
presidency
I am happy to note an increased amount of agreement , particularly on the question of enlargement
We have also seen agreement between the three main institutions , which has not always been the case
In addition , I am particularly happy to note the changes concerning the enlargement of the Schengen area , which is strengthening credibility and trust within the Union
I do have one regret , however , concerning our continued failure to establish a supervisory body for the Galileo programme under the 2003 Council decision
I should also like to congratulate Finland for having joined the ranks of the Member States who have ratified the Constitutional Treaty
Mr President , on behalf of its southern neighbours I would like to congratulate the Finnish Presidency
I fully agree with what you said , Mr Prime Minister , that the borders of Europe are not drawn on maps but defined by common values
Second point
We need to address this huge gap of popular opinion through joint efforts
We need to exchange our experiences , our prejudices , our fears
Practice shows that often these fears are not founded
We need to share common historic experiences and common fears and this will be , I hope , a real way to ratify the Constitutional Treaty
Mr President , my thanks and congratulations to all those involved in the Finnish Presidency
I have felt for some time that the success of a Presidency is inversely proportional to the size of the country
And so to the Constitutional Treaty
The Irish are due to ratify by referendum , but my question is: which text
We have had President Borrell Fontelles telling us that there is no doubt the text will not be implemented as it stands
He said that in Italy
In Ireland recently he said we must go ahead and ratify the text as it stands
I was not there; I was in Brussels voting at a part-session
and Dutch
On the other hand , 18 Member States have already ratified it
We have heard from my good colleague , Mr Poettering , who wants ratification of the Constitutional Treaty
Mixed messages are going out
The countries that have to ratify it by referendum particularly need clear guidance
Is it the existing text or do we wait for a new text
Yes , it is over to the Germans
A happy Christmas to everybody
Mr President , first I wish to congratulate the Finnish Presidency on completing Romanian and Bulgarian accession
one of delicate national sovereignty
I am also grateful he accepted some of my report's amendments on higher duty-free allowances coming into the European Union from third countries by air or sea
community
I agree that it is also right to get tough and speak toughly with Russia
It is also a great idea to negotiate free trade agreements with Asian democracies such as India
Lastly , enlargement in the Western Balkans , in particular Croatia , is now a German Presidency priority , but we do not need a full-blown EU Constitution to achieve that
- (PL) Mr President , I agree that the last six months have been overshadowed by relations between the European Union and Russia
What more can we say
is becoming more united
I would like to add to the list of this presidency's practical achievements , which have not already been mentioned , the European Institute of Technology project adopted in Lahti
his persistence in bringing this project to life
disgrace on Europe
of changing this situation
the European Union in Brussels was termed 'remarkably quiet and boring'
In my view , the Summit was highly business-like and of great importance for the idea of a unified and non-discriminatory Europe
By this I mean free movement without passport controls for all , including citizens from the new Member States
Mr President of the Council , the Finnish presidency conveyed an important message to all Europeans
Within the context of the so-called Schengen area , the border of Europe will move eastwards as of 1 January 2008 , from the Czech-German to the Slovakia-Ukraine border
The Finnish presidency set the necessary basic tone
I believe that Slovakia in particular , together with all the new Member States , will meet all of the requirements and that the Schengen area will be extended
I wish all of you a Merry Christmas
(PL) Mr President , Prime Minister , six months ago you outlined two main priorities for your presidency: energy and European innovation
next six months
However , I would like to congratulate you on completing the seventh framework programme and implementing it
I would also like to congratulate President Barroso
The collaboration between Parliament and the Council and the Commission in the field of innovation was generally exemplary
We can now make ourselves understood in many matters that are important to Europe
There is no European victory or civilisation that is of importance on a world scale without economic innovation
For this reason I repeat my congratulations both to the Commission and to the European Council for their success in this field
Thank you very much , Mr Buzek
We have now come to the end of speeches based on the procedure of opening the floor without a previously established list of speakers
It is now the turn of the Presidents of the Council and the Commission
Parliament will understand if you are unable to respond exhaustively to all of the questions that have been raised
President-in-Office of the Council
mine
I would nonetheless like to mention one , where the speaker was clearly of another opinion
Mr Farage said that we would like the Union to have more power
That is not the issue here: the Union already has a good deal of competence
The question is that the Union should have the means and tools to exercise its competence
tools to do it
At present , the Council , in particular , does not have these means available to it owing to decision-making and voting systems and requirements of unanimity
sought and results achieved
I would endorse what Mrs Grosset√™te said that 2006 has been Parliament's year in particular
This year has seen perhaps some of the biggest legislative projects of this decade brought to conclusion
to make decisions
One of the challenges of the future will be facing us already next year , when a decision must also be taken on the European Institute of Technology
The European Council declared that 2007 should be the year to make a decision on that
The Commission and the Council are going to have plenty of work to do next year regarding this
With regard to enlargement , I think that we need to focus particular attention on the Western Balkans
own amendments to the Treaty and to continue negotiations on enlargement
the European Parliament elections in 2009 can be put in place
If we succeed in this , there are bound not to be any problems with enlargement either
can be surmounted in the name of cooperation
The early part of this debate in particular was evidence of that
this same sort of cooperation here at EU level
My sincere thanks to everyone
One or two specific questions were asked , one of which related to Russian agricultural trade
I believe that the President of the Commission will reply to that
(Applause)
President of the Commission
Mr President , we in the Commission are used to having the more difficult questions to solve
This was indeed a successful Presidency and , as someone said , it was the last Presidency of a European Union of 25 members
On 1 January 2007 we are going to welcome Romania and Bulgaria
One of the achievements of these last six months was the finalisation of all these processes - the ratification in the Member States
The good work that has been done was important , as was the election , with a great deal of support , of the two new Commissioners from Romania and Bulgaria
Once again , I would like to thank Parliament for its support
It was a very clear signal of this Parliament's support for the enlarged European Union
Regarding Russia , I think the debates we have had over the past six months have been helpful in establishing the basis for our relationship with Russia
Russia is a very important partner , a close neighbour and a partner with whom we want to have a strategic long-term relationship
We should avoid two risks
One is the 'business as usual' approach , pretending that everything is going in the right direction
It is not
There are some concerns
Another risk is a kind of confrontational position with Russia
I do not think this is in our interests , nor is it in the interests of all those who want a democratic , progressive Russia
We should have a constructive , positive engagement with Russia , trying to make it a win-win situation , namely on the energy issue
I have said before that we were divided from Russia and the Soviet Union for so long because of our ideologies
Let us not now be divided from Russia because of energy
Let us make it a positive factor
be very firm on matters of principle , namely on human rights
On this matter we have to tell our Russian partners that this is non-negotiable
That is the position we have been taking publicly and privately in the talks with our Russian partners
When it comes to Russia , we will be able to control some events but not others
The future of Russia will depend mainly on the dynamics of Russia
It is a huge country
It would be a mistake to think that we can control its future
We do not and should not control that
However , there is something we can control , which is solidarity among our Member States
on the issues that are now on the table
That depends on us
We can have a common approach to Russia if we really want to
There have been some attempts to divide us but at the Lahti Summit we were able to speak with one voice on energy
Now , in the face of an embargo on one of our Member States , we can also express a common position
We hope that common position is maintained when it comes to the mandate for the future framework agreement with Russia
I hope that matter can be solved
and a position that is also useful for the future of our relations with Russia
This principle of solidarity has to be a cornerstone in our external relations and also in how we build the European Union
for everything he has done as leader of such an important group in the European Parliament and say how much I appreciate his sincere commitment to our European values
say goodbye or adieu but just Auf Wiedersehen
I wish you all a merry Christmas and a very good 2007
(Applause)
The debate is closed
The next item is the joint debate on the European Council report and Commission statement on the meeting of the European Council of 14 and 15 December 2006 and the
(FI) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is a pleasure for me to be here once again to talk with you in my capacity as President of the European
I will not go into details regarding the individual Member States' positions , as we are bound by the confidential nature of the talks , but I do want to give
We are still in a dilemma , though: the Treaty cannot be put before the Member States that rejected it in exactly the same form as before , even though it
We have a procedure that would enhance decision-making on justice and home affairs , the passerelle provided by Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union , which allows us to decide
The Finnish Presidency was very eager to explore this possibility but at the September meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Tampere it was evident that a
That is why I welcome the fact that , in spite of everything , the European Council sent an unequivocal message that more effective decision-making on justice and home affairs is important ,
In this connection , I would say that , if there was one thing that I could change in the Union generally , with the experience of the EU Presidency behind me , it
Something else essential for the Union's sustainable economic growth and our competitiveness is how we are to agree on common energy policy goals and engage in wide-ranging , global cooperation to
The European Council's conclusions on energy and climate issues demonstrate that more consistent progress is now being made , as they point the Union to the path towards the spring summit
If it is dull for decisions to be taken in an orderly fashion and on schedule , then yes , I have to say that I am dull and proud of
I am proud to say that the EU took a strong and united position on Lebanon , acted decisively to implement the resolutions passed by the UN Security Council and ,
It is essential that we have a Union that is united and resolute in its external relations and that can use its wide range of instruments to work for a
During our Presidency , we have also done a great deal to improve the coherence of development policy , for instance: an issue of primary importance to a significant global actor
Russia is important for the EU and we are bound together by many ties , but it is fair to say that there are a lot of developments in Russia
I will now have some splendid memories of good cooperation with Parliament and I would like to thank you all for the support you have given Finland in its
I would also like to thank you on behalf of the European Parliament for your excellent collaboration and constant presence , and that of your ministers , especially your European Affairs
The consideration you have given to the European Parliament has produced tangible and concrete legislative results that will be remembered , such as the acts we have just signed and
So I believe that Prime Minister Vanhanen and the Finnish Presidency are to be congratulated on holding fast to a clear direction for the Union: a Europe of results
I think it illustrates a general trend towards a consistent approach , building ambitious policy reform for Europe year on year , an approach better suited to the kind of consensus
At the European Council meeting we expressed our gratitude for the role that President Borrell Fontelles has played during his period in office , the role he has played while
If you look at what has really happened in concrete terms on the Services Directive , on enlargement , on energy , on REACH (we have just witnessed the signature of the REACH
regulation) , on the seventh research framework programme (the biggest ever , with a 40% increase in real terms) , on the new system for Schengen (especially important for new Member States) , on
our response on Lebanon , on our response on the Congo (where the European Union was by far the biggest contributor to the successful democratic elections , the first ever in that
important African country) , on all those issues and on several others we have seen the three institutions much more focused on delivering results to the citizens of Europe and , hopefully ,
The Commission's report on integration capacity was praised and , I believe , succeeds in demonstrating that rigour and fairness are at the heart of how the enlargement process works , that
For us , enlargement is not only an important policy in itself , it also embodies some core principles of the Union: that we are forward-looking , open , rules-based , fair and grounded in
The consensus shows that strict conditions must be met , but we must keep the momentum moving forward in relation to our existing negotiating partners and give new impetus to
I have to tell you very frankly it is regrettable that some Member States oppose the proposal of the Finnish Presidency , supported by the European Commission , to make use
I have to underline once again that we need a more efficient decision-making process in the area of justice and home affairs in the European Union , and not only in
I know that Parliament shares the conviction that the innovation agenda is central to a competitive Europe and I look forward to our working together on this in the
Over the last six months we have seen the European Union delivering , showing that it is serious about the twin-track strategy of a Europe of results to move Europe forward ,
We have a springboard to take us forward into next year , with a wide range of new programmes now negotiated and in place , such as the framework programme for
If you look at three key areas - economy , energy and climate , and external policy - you can see the European Union delivering real change on issues that matter for
Therefore the report adopted by Parliament last week on cleaner , greener energy was excellently timed: it will help us shape our final recommendations and confirms our own conviction that
In various parts of the world and on a wide range of issues - Lebanon , Congo and the results achieved at long last with our Russian partners on the
At the Summit , Chancellor Merkel made it clear that the time for general debate on the future of the Constitution is over and that she will be focusing on
It is my impression that there is a gathering momentum and a degree of willingness among Member States to work constructively to find a way forward on the issue of
I look forward to working closely with the incoming German Presidency and I should like to thank once again the Finnish Prime Minister , Mr Vanhanen , and all his team
- (DE) Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to start by congratulating the President-in-Office of the Council
Not only has his been a successful Presidency , but also - and maybe it takes a country such as Finland to achieve this - the goodwill he has shown
We have just seen the signing of REACH , and the Seventh Research Framework Programme and the Services Directive have been adopted , although we know that previous Presidencies and Parliament
Parliament can also take a little pride in the increasingly influential role it has been playing in the legislative process - as the Commission President has just emphasised once
Nevertheless , Turkey , too , must honour its commitments , and that is why the path taken by the Presidency and Parliament together at the suggestion of the Commission is a good
Speaking for the EPP component of our group , let no one mistake our resoluteness in affirming our desire for results , before the European elections , on the ratification of the
I hope that the joint declaration of 25 March - that is , the declaration by the European Council , the European Parliament and the European Commission - proves an early
It may even be our most important task to make a commitment to refusing to accept the misery and death being suffered at the borders of the EU and
If we really make the beginnings of a contribution to giving people a future in their own countries too , with our assistance , namely through dialogue - which will hopefully
Subsequently , on 15 January , our new Group Chairman will thank the President officially on behalf of the PPE-DE Group for his impressive work; whereas I should like to do
I wish to thank Mr Schulz , as the representative of his group - and also his predecessor Mr Bar√≥n Crespo , but particularly Mr Schulz - for the cooperation I
The same goes for Mr Watson , whom I should also like to thank for the professional cooperation and the relationship of trust I have always enjoyed with him , as
The next Group Chairman should ensure that the Chairman of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group also takes his place in the front row of the European
There is even common ground with Mr Bonde on the issue of transparency , although I should like to add that there are few other issues of which this can
There is common ground with Mrs Belohorsk√° , representing the non-attached Members , on the conviction that even those who do not have strength in numbers have the right to fair
I am certain that our dream can become reality: the dream of a strong Europe , a democratic Europe , a Europe capable of action , a Europe oriented towards the rule
You will have noticed that I have not been too strict with the time given the special circumstances surrounding Mr Poettering's speech and I will do the same for
- (DE) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has thanked the President-in-Office of the Council , which is a
It is true that journalistic bloodbaths are less important to the EU than tangible results , and so I , too , wish to judge this Summit on its results rather than
A clear message was also sent out at the weekend to those who believe that enlargement can be continued without carrying out the reforms that are essential as part
That , too , is an important message , as those saying that enlargement should be carried out on the basis of the Treaty of Nice have to understand that the notion
For this reason , I should like to make it clear here that , without the reforms built into the constitutional process , there will be no enlargement with the support of
In the course of the debate at the weekend , we heard a second positive - in my opinion very positive - series of statements that will point the way ahead
The fact that the EU has declared its support for migration policy by moving away from just restrictions and admitting that we in this continent need migration and controlled
Here , too , however , this much is quite clear: the necessary legal armoury - the bridging clause - which is also in place under the Treaty of Nice , as has
If I were to describe an objective on the one hand , but on the other hand refuse to use the instruments I needed to achieve this objective , this would
For this reason , it is my firm conviction that Parliament must apply further pressure on the Council to take consistent action once and for all and to say that ,
As can be deduced from the heckling , my group worked to ensure that the legislation made it possible to reach a sensible compromise focusing on social equilibrium , industrial good
I should like to extend warm thanks once more to Mrs Gebhardt and Mr Sacconi , who carried out pilot work in this connection on behalf of our group , for
By way of conclusion , I should like to mention Mr Poettering's reference to the fact that his term of office as Chairman of the PPE-DE Group is coming to an
There is one thing that has defined Mr Poettering as a personality since he became an MEP in 1979 , and that is that one can disagree with him , argue
I shall not thank the President on behalf of my group colleagues for the performance of his duties just yet - that is for later - but I shall
That is a great step forward and I hope that the German Presidency will take it further by getting agreement among Member States to publish the correlation tables so
Prime Minister , you also have to your credit an agreement on REACH , an agreement on the Services Directive , on which thankfully - whatever Mr Schulz says - we defeated all
Liberals and Democrats also salute your efforts to try to get agreement on the footbridge Article 42 clause and we regret that this was not possible at the Lahti Summit ,
but we therefore disagree with paragraph 3 of the Presidency Conclusions , which says that the Union is 'making best use of the possibilities offered by the existing treaties to deliver
It is clearly not making best use of the possibilities , as you recognise a few paragraphs later , when we say that responding to the expectations of citizens is difficult
We therefore welcome the recognition in the Presidency Conclusions of the wider aspects , particularly the link between development policy and immigration policy and the need for a legal migration
If you look at the other things you discussed at the summit about Sudan , if the European Union really recognised the new UN doctrine of the duty to protect , fewer
We need leadership from our Heads of State and Government telling people what a success enlargement has been and how continued enlargement will be needed , once we have our
Your Presidency has , in our view , been a success and we hope the return to the land of Santa Claus will allow you a good rest next week , undisturbed , I
I also wish to put on the record once again my thanks to Minister Lehtom√§ki who , over the last six months , has been so good to all of us

Having thanked the Presidency , I have to say that the direction of the debate , which defines this final summit as a Council towards a Europe of results , leaves me truly
With regard to the issue of enlargement , ten years ago , before the accession of Finland , Sweden and Austria , we waged an enormous battle in this Parliament to ensure that
the issues of the Constitution and institutional change were tackled earlier and better , as compared with an enlargement carried out hurriedly and which will certainly not benefit the majority of
Next , with regard to the Constitution , we have reached the obvious point that many in this Parliament are trying to state , with greater or lesser success , depending on the degree

We are also talking about preventive measures from a different source

Where does the resistance lie
Ladies and gentlemen , it does not lie in the complexity of our legal system , which will continue to exist
The law is not a tool for creating conflicts , but for resolving them
This has been the view of the conservative governments that have supported the initiative based on sound judgment

All this work is very important

Thank you for this work
It is going to be taken into consideration when we prepare the victims package
Mr President , roughly 8 000 Romanian women in Spain have benefited this year , as victims , from protection orders which are valid in Spain
They must also be extended to Romania and other Member States in which they travel
According to unofficial estimates , there are roughly 100 000 women in Europe benefiting from protection orders which are valid in the state that issued them
The draft directive changes the limited , territorial aspect of these protection measures
the area of freedom , security and justice becomes a reality and the victims of violence or other victims can live and travel without fear
Parliament's desire is for victims' protection to be extended
area of justice and security
We are therefore awaiting the package with eagerness and interest in spring 2011
for victims
repeated threats from known and previously identified persons - often ex-boyfriends , husbands or partners - who threaten their physical and sexual integrity , dignity and personal freedom
Indeed , the number of attacks and killings - particularly against women - is on the increase
in which they are issued
Commissioner Reding , the measure under approval may not be perfect , but it plugs a legislative vacuum
After all , in creating the European area of freedom , security and justice , we have always acted empirically , at times pushing matters through where necessary
the proposal
Through the establishment of the European Protection Order , the protected person is guaranteed to be looked after even in other Member States , through a fast and free-of-charge procedure
order has been issued
involving codecision between the Council and Parliament for the first time
does not miss this particular chance to respond right now to this extremely serious situation , which is also demonstrated by European and national statistics
Amongst other things , this could lead to important legal convergence among Member States
I would therefore suggest that we avoid any delays and make a specific commitment to this particular type of victim protection
is preparing in order for us to have a similar instrument for all types of crime
I regret the fact that the drafting of this text has been so difficult and complex , despite the fact that we all share its central objective
I would also have liked this order to have incorporated two issues
Firstly , the European register of protection orders , with the corresponding privacy guarantees , in order to prevent bureaucracy for the beneficiaries and have the orders applied immediately
Moreover , this would reduce the cost of the processes that have to be carried out by the competent authorities , and would ultimately provide standardised , constantly updated statistics
of the victims and their possible changes of residence
real to all Europeans at the moment
I would like to thank the rapporteurs for all their work , and I hope that Commissioner Reding will be sensitive with this initiative
too , we must protect women who are victims of violence and put a stop to murderers
As has been said , this is about combating a type of social terrorism , which is chauvinist violence
We must not , therefore , get caught up in statistics or legal ins and outs
2 500 women every year are victims of the legal lethargy in which we are all immersed
We are all aware of the legal difficulties and that this is an innovative exercise in the post-Lisbon interinstitutional dynamic
However , those difficulties should not , under any circumstances , be an excuse for not moving forward

harassment by a relative or a former partner
I have seen at first hand the distress that physical , psychological and sexual abuse can cause and the state of vulnerability of its victims
I fully support the aims and objectives of this proposal
However , I also have to express concerns regarding the legal base and scope
It seems clear to me that this proposal has a criminal base only , through the use of Article 82 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU
of Article 81
can be effectively implemented at Member State level without compromising existing Member State legal systems
on behalf of the EFD Group
- Mr President , I support the protection of victims
intrusive and dictatorial pieces of legislation ever to be imposed on the British people
The proposal for the European Protection Order which is being touted says it is about the protection of women
that
Let us be clear and honest here: the underlying goal is to put in place footings for a pan-European justice system which will undoubtedly undermine British law
If proof were needed , we only have to look at the European Arrest Warrant
foreign judge in a foreign land who knows nothing about the conditions of a British town or our way of life
We have a saying in England: 'once bitten , twice shy'
We have been bitten once by the European Arrest Warrant
I suggest that we shy away from the European Protection Order
important goals
the European Union
For this reason , I believe that we should support the rapporteur's position
It should be noted , too , that the initiative has a deliberately broad scope
both sexes , provided the perpetrator has been identified
nationals or residents , are in need of special support and legal protection
incest and other crimes of this type
This initiative should therefore be supported , and I lend my full support to the rapporteur
(NL) Mr President , one hundred thousand people are currently benefiting from the European Protection Order
One of them is Rasja , who would like to move to Spain with her children
the Spanish authorities recognise or enforce the same order
Fortunately , however , Spain does recognise it
This protection also applies to those being persecuted for exercising their right to free speech
They have to be able to speak in other European countries with the knowledge that those who have threatened them will not be sitting there in the audience
The European Protection Order makes that possible; it is a splendid initiative and one that has been supported by the Dutch Government
every day are callously being left high and dry
It is simply unacceptable that an individual's safety should stop at the border
For the sake of one hundred thousand people , I am now saying 'yes' to the European Protection Order

The text being presented to us today is an extremely important text , and I once again extend my congratulations

Madam President , domestic violence , genital mutilation , honour crimes , forced marriages and trafficking are just some of the types of violence against 45% of women across Europe
Women and minors need improved protection
of freedom , security and justice serving the citizen
Protection orders issued in one European country against an offender will thus be enforced in all the other 26 EU Member States
The initiative of the Spanish Presidency , embraced today by all of us , emphasises the protection of victims and prevention , and promotes uniformity in legal order procedures
It empowers victims to break their silence in seeking protection beyond geographical boundaries in Europe
I hope the Commission fully endorses the report of the two co-rapporteurs in its ambitious package on victims' rights
guarantees , above all for women , but not exclusively so , as has already been said
The guidelines for this measure had already been developed , firstly by the Treaty of Lisbon , and then by the Stockholm Programme
the Council to smooth the way for this particularly important proposal , for an area of freedom , justice and security that will really serve citizens
The proposal combats domestic violence firmly and determinedly , has quite a significant range of measures and a scope that appears to be wholly consistent
These ready-made , timely and effective precautionary measures lead us to believe that this proposal could also be used effectively to protect victims' families
We await with interest the more structured package announced by Commissioner Reding regarding the protection of victims of violence , which will be ready in the coming weeks
this measure in practice , just as it is crucial not to forget the importance of psychological support for the victims
I am sure the Commission will duly bear this in mind in the final phase of the legislative process
(FI) Madam President , the European Protection Order is an important step towards the protection of victims throughout Europe
into force soon
for opposing it
It is important that the directive should be applied over a wide area
It must incorporate not just orders in respect of criminal acts but also various other kinds of protection order
It should not involve any sort of legal hairsplitting
This protection order should also be flexible enough to take account of the differences in national legislation
It is important that Parliament focuses attention not only on the victims of genderbased violence , but on other victims of violence
myself have tried to highlight in Parliament's position
It is also important that the country in which the protection order is being requested informs its citizens of these procedures
When the protection order enters into force , the work will not have really stopped there
The authorities need to be educated , and we cannot be completely satisfied with an information campaign that is simply restricted to the framework of the present one
(PL) Madam President , the provisions included in the report under discussion today fill me with great enthusiasm
fear of repeated violence represents an opportunity for them to lead a normal life
The European Protection Order will mean that protection measures adopted in one EU Member State can be recognised , applied and enforced by courts in another Member State
What is more , extending the application of the directive to the victims of any kind of violence , not just the victims of gender-based violence , represents a further milestone
All victims deserve respect and expect that the perpetrators of their suffering will be punished fairly
real protection to the victim
I am delighted that Poland was one of the countries that put forward this initiative
States
Victims of violence must be protected against the perpetrators not only in their own countries , but must have protective measures made available to them throughout the EU
Although this is a broad proposal , it directly concerns women who are victims of domestic violence
or the situation of witnesses or of victims of terrorism and organised crime
I personally very much applaud the effort to provide the best possible protection to victims also by ensuring the necessary legal certainty , among other things
the countries they want to move to , or to which they have already moved
(IT) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I greatly appreciate the work carried out by the two rapporteurs
by another and therefore must be defended against a repeat of whatever physical or mental abuse took place
Obviously , this is a matter of fundamental importance for hundreds of thousands of women in the European Union and therefore I fully support its content
identifiable person , but from organisations against which a restraining order certainly cannot be applied
of criminal activity , and it seems to me that Mrs Jim√©nez and Commissioner Reding are of the same mind
in the course of duty on a European level
(DE) Madam President , the European Protection Order is a step in the right direction
The principle must be that recognised victims of violence are afforded the same level of protection in all Member States
The best solution would be harmonisation of the laws of the Member States on this matter , but it was not possible to achieve this
and , above all , exploitation of minors , which I consider to be very , very important
It therefore sends a positive message to the victims of violence and to women in particular
States to avoid compliance with the directive
Therefore , in a year's time , we need to assess very carefully how we can take this debate further , because all victims in all countries need the same protection
(SK) Madam President , I would like to support the idea contained in the draft European Protection Order
The protection of persons under threat at the level of individual Member States appears to be insufficient in many cases
Thanks to the openness of the European space today , young people often enter into international marriages and international marriage commitments
Not all of these commitments last long , however , and the children often then become hostages to disputes between their parents
hands and carry off the children of former partners to their own countries , exploiting differences between the legal systems of individual Member States to overcome valid court decisions
The victims of this European legal anarchy are often small , innocent children
I hope this problem will be resolved by the European Protection Order
(DE) Madam President , even though some measures have been taken in recent years to protect victims , many of the people affected often feel left in the lurch
While lawyers and judges hear a great deal in their training about the rights of defendants , they learn very little about dealing with victims
This is not the only area where greater awareness is necessary
It is also needed in medical training so that the use of violence can be better recognised
For child victims , the matter of the statutory limitation of civil compensation claims in the case of sex offences is essential
Only those who have an unblemished criminal record are allowed to work with children
of genital mutilation performed on a minor , this clearly shows the potential danger of the much lauded multicultural enrichment
In my opinion , it is important to take this development in the EU into consideration , as well as its significance in the fight against human trafficking
means of protecting victims , but it is far from being the only one
sorry to say , the greatest experts in terms of what they need
I have two questions for Mrs Reding and the rapporteurs
experience
Union's twin , the Council of Europe , and to what extent we are participating in the preparation of this work
(DE) Madam President , the safety of the women affected really ought to be a matter of concern to all of us
account
This European Protection Order should apply to all victims of violence , irrespective of their age or gender
Madam President , I would like also to thank the rapporteur
Safeguarding life , physical and psychological integrity , as well as sexual integrity and freedom , are priority objectives where victim protection is concerned
that are effective within the Union and grant legal protection and assistance for victims of crime , in particular , violent crimes
to uphold this right within and beyond national borders
the European Union
Madam President , I think that in this debate , we have clearly seen that we are all in agreement in supporting the objective of this report
The various political groups have shown their support for this directive , which offers greater protection to victims
My question is , therefore: what obstacles are there to adopting this instrument
I repeat: what fears are there regarding something as essential and simple as protecting victims equally across Europe finally becoming a reality
legal hurdles in our negotiations , and I welcome the fact that the Commission acknowledges our work , just as we acknowledge the work that it will do in the future
will be presented by the Commission , with which I promise to cooperate
Let us therefore be brave and responsible , and let us help all those who have the right to live in a safer Europe
I repeat: let us help everyone , be they men , women or children
all , their dignity
Madam President , Commissioner , we know that there are no legal measures included in the package that is being prepared for victims
This has just been criticised by the European women's lobby in Parliament: there is talk of good practice and coordination , but we still have a long way to go
I would also like to say that the origins of the violence that we are experiencing are not exotic: it is our own violence
I would like to say to the Council and the Member States that violence that comes from other cultures also requires a legal instrument
It is not possible to combat genital mutilation , honour crimes and all the harassment suffered by women from other cultures without an instrument of this nature
are also included in this legal instrument

Even if Parliament and the Commission had agreed on the same text , we would still have a battle to fight
the case
You said during your previous appearance that we had not realised the significance of the Charter of Fundamental Rights
We did realise its significance
measures , and sometimes there are obstacles in their path
The greatest obstacle is political will
This is why it is so important that we all agree on an initiative of this nature , and it is now up to the Council
It is now up to the Member States to decide whether this instrument is really one that is going to be effective for victims and necessary
We believe that it is , which is why we have defended this instrument and why we are here
We also defend its urgency
this initiative will see it as the only procedure that can be used now and in the future
It is an instrument that is difficult and complex in nature , but which opens the way and will protect victims and the citizenship of women
Vice-President of the Commission
- Madam President , I did not intend to speak again , but what has been said needs to be corrected
a proposal on civil protection measures and , if necessary , a proposal on criminal protection measures
This will be put on the table of this House in May next year
We cannot just go ahead and put our ideas on paper
All our proposals must be accompanied by a thorough impact assessment
We need to take this very seriously , aiming for sound studies with real added value
That is what we are doing at the moment
efficient protection measures

It has been rejected on the basis of subsidiarity
We are in the middle of a very complicated issue

Frequent domestic tension , brawls and beatings turn family members into traumatised victims who are forced to accept this situation as being the norm

area and civil society
In this respect , the European Protection Order must be a strong instrument capable of providing a safer haven for victims of violence across Member States' borders
genital mutilation , forced marriages , honour crimes , incest , gender-based violence , as well as witnesses and victims of terrorism and organised crime
The next item is the report by Mrs Jim√©nez-Becerril Barrio and Mrs Romero L√≥pez , on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality , on the draft directive of
Today , Parliament will honour all victims , reminding those who believe that the borders will shield them while they persecute their victims , that this European Protection Order will protect all victims
We started working more than a year ago to achieve this objective and make progress with the area of freedom and security that was mentioned in the Stockholm Programme , and
today we can say with a degree of pride that , although the path has not been easy , as many people have frequently failed to understand the order , and doubted its
I must say that , following the trialogues with the Belgian Presidency , and many conversations with the Commission , we have achieved a text that almost all the political groups were happy
This report was therefore adopted by a huge majority with no votes against in the joint vote by the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs and the
This would send a clear message to the Council about what Europeans want , which is nothing more than to live in an area of security and justice , to be
I therefore wanted to include victims of terrorism , people trafficking , organised crime and honour crimes , along with a special chapter for minors , who are the most vulnerable victims , and
Although this order will protect all victims , women who suffer from domestic violence will benefit most from this instrument for judicial cooperation , as their aggressors will not be able to
We will therefore vote with our eyes fixed on the victims , on those who suffer , on those who need us to protect them , on those who are afraid and
We are not going to give up on such a fair and necessary aim that is supported by the majority of Europeans just because there are some who are afraid
We need to be brave , the Member States need to be brave , and I hope that the vote today will be a majority in favour and encourage those who
I also hope that in the near future , the Commission will put forward wide-ranging legislation in favour of victims' rights , for which it has my full support and , I
I repeat: this small but major step that is the European Protection Order will improve protection for all victims , preventing further crimes and relieving the consequences of those that have
Mr President , this proposal for a directive that we are bringing to plenary today to keep away aggressors who pursue their victims until they kill them , wherever they hide , is
We are not going to remain defenceless against the crimes that are still repeatedly committed on a daily basis in European countries , and remain hidden in the shadows of people's
These crimes also remain in the statistical shadows , as if the law of survival of the strongest took sole precedence at the heart of cohabitation , but we are trying
Did it not occur to those drafting Chapter I of the Charter that a threat to physical integrity and dignity could come not only from the public institutions and the
For the 25% of European women currently suffering some form of violence , their torturers have private names , and defending themselves against the attacks does not allow them to be
Let us create a climate of mutual trust; through the protection order , we are creating an area of justice and freedom , because the victims of these crimes can be
Not all countries have or are going to have the same legal traditions: the more progress we make , the more an instrument that can provide for our diversity is
If we were talking about guarantees and fundamental rights when we talked about terrorism , how could we have implemented international agreements if it was not because we were talking
The improvements that we have incorporated regarding the right to information , translation and procedural guarantees have taken into account the fact that this is a recognition instrument , and Parliament
Through this vote today , we want to send a message to the Council that this is Parliament's will; now it is up to the Council to take on its
- Mr President , the protection of citizens , in practice mostly women , subjected to or at risk of violence is very high on the agenda of all the institutions working
That is also why I have supported the aim of this protection from the outset , and that is the reason why I am preparing the ambitious package on victims'
I am fully aware of the work of the co-rapporteurs , Ms Jim√©nez-Becerril Barrio and Ms Romero L√≥pez , and of both the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and the
I look at some of the proposals you have made: for instance , that victims do not have to bear the costs , that they receive translation and interpretation services or
The corollary of this is that we work on the rights of persons who have been victims , because we very often speak about the accused in court proceedings but
That is why the Commission's future victims package will build on and develop the excellent work undertaken by the Spanish Presidency , the Belgian Presidency , the Council and , of course , the
It will be put together so that when the victims package is on the table , it will be comprehensive , it will be complete , and it will make a real
difference to all victims - be they women , children or men , although most are women and children - to enable us to quickly come up with concrete measures which are
The instrument being introduced will ensure that a protection order issued in one Member State will be recognised in the Member States in which the victim travels so that
This is why , after this directive , we are asking for and anticipating from the Commission that the next step will be to extend protection to victims in this common
I would like to end by reiterating that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) gives its support to protection for victims , this draft directive and extended protection
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , through this proposal for a directive - for which I should like to express my great thanks to the rapporteurs , with whom I worked as
a shadow - Parliament is supporting and expanding the Council's proposal , which was designed to protect people across all 27 Member States who suffer forms of persecution or serious and
Their complaints are often not taken seriously enough by the police and the judiciary , and protection orders and measures against the aggressor are currently only valid in the country
Indeed , we believe that this initiative is important because it will allow all citizens of the European Union - men and women - and all European residents to travel
freely across borders , taking their human rights and their rights to protection and security with them , as stated in Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon , which we in the
Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament intended as the legal basis , in order to give a more coherent direction to the structure of
Each Member State must appoint a competent authority to inform victims of their rights , carry out campaigns , collect statistics and inform the person as soon as their national protection
Furthermore , it gives a great boost to the creation of the European legal area and the implementation of freedom of movement , and it also applies the ordinary legislative procedure
I hope that the Council will confirm this commitment and I hope that the Commission - though showing particular attention to the coming 'Security for Victims' package of measures -
Mr President , I want the European Protection Order to be particularly effective in preventing violence against women and to serve as a helpful prelude to the proposal that the Commission
Secondly , I believe that we should have made an effort to explore cooperation in this field with third countries , especially if we pay attention to the statistics regarding the origins
The incipient European External Action Service has thus lost the opportunity to publicly introduce itself with a mission such as this , which Europeans understand and which solves problems that are
Mr President , I think that we in Parliament need to be very responsible and act within the mandate that we have been given , which tells us that , at European level
We are talking about justice , basic rights , life and death , defending those that must be defended against their attackers , and , most importantly , not having to regret the fact that
The protection of the rights of the women who have been or could be victims of violence and murders and the prevention of such acts cannot be subordinated to
It goes without saying that it is important to do things well but , above all , it is essential that we do them and , in my view , that is the fundamental
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the two rapporteurs and both the Spanish and Belgian presidencies for the work they have done in order to continue making
- Mr President , I have been following the trialogues closely and would like to thank my colleagues , especially from the EPP and S&D Groups , for the work they have
As a lawyer in the UK , I have had experience over the years of providing legal advice and support to people who have been victims of domestic abuse , stalking or
By their nature and by law , some of the offences that this proposal intends to cover are civil law matters , yet there is a noticeable absence of the use
Whilst I do not object to EU legal cooperation , I strongly believe that we need to ensure that the legislation we produce at EU level is legally sound , robust and
However , when I first came across the European Protection Order , I thought it sounded scary , like the European Arrest Warrant , which , in my opinion , is one of the most
We were told that the European Arrest Warrant was about helping to fight terrorism - and we all know it has gone on to be a lot more than
I also see these orders as being extremely difficult to enforce in the UK , for we will end up in a situation whereby an order is handed down by a
(PL) Mr President , taking the proposed amendments into account , there is no mistaking the fact that the directive in question is one of the first initiatives aimed at achieving these
We should ensure not only that the victims of violence are safe from further harm in their own country , but also that they benefit from such protection measures throughout
Although the majority of protection orders issued relate to women who are victims of gender-based violence , the initiative can cover all victims of violence - children and adults of
In this context , the Stockholm Programme states that the victims of crime , including terrorism , who are most vulnerable or who find themselves in particularly exposed situations , such as persons
subjected to repeated violence in close relationships , victims of gender-based violence or persons who fall victim to other types of crimes in a Member State of which they are not
In connection with the above , the European Protection Order should apply to the victims of all crimes , including human trafficking , the victims of female genital mutilation , forced marriages , honour killings ,
If the order pronounced against her stalker in the Netherlands does not relocate with her to Spain , she and her children , too , will become a sitting target there , unless
Unfortunately , with the new coalition , the status of people enjoying such protection has undergone a 180 degree reversal: women , men and children who are having to live in fear
I expect all governments , including that of my own country , to do their utmost to increase the safety , protection and freedom of their citizens , so that all people can
(FR) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I should , of course , like to thank the two co-rapporteurs who , following difficult negotiations in the trialogue , are proposing a
Secondly , although I regret , as some have said today , that certain points such as , for instance , the translation of documents for victims , were not included in the body of the
text of this agreement , or that the simplification elements were not sufficiently detailed - and I am counting on the 'victims package' to polish them up - I want to
stress that in the end , all this sounds like common sense today , like a logical continuation of the ever-greater integration of a European area of freedom and justice and , in
This bears witness to a certain amount of political boldness and of the will to go beyond political posturing for a large majority of us , in order to have a
That tool represents to a certain extent , as Mrs Reding highlighted earlier on , a true 'rights' policy in Europe , that is to say , a real policy for the people ,
(FR) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , may I say first of all that I find the Council's absence since yesterday regrettable , since the Council has generally been present in
I wish to congratulate the two co-rapporteurs - who have done a huge amount of work on this text - on this landmark progress for victims of all kinds: victims ,
firstly , of domestic violence - did you know that 45% of European women are victims of domestic violence , as are some men , for we should not forget those men who
We are anxious to see the 'victims package' that you will be presenting to us next year , Commissioner , and which will complete the text that we will vote on
The European Protection Order is a good step forward to doing just that , in full compliance with the vision of the Stockholm Programme for a united Europe: an area
(IT) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , there is no doubt that this directive on the European Protection Order to safeguard victims is another sign of a momentous shift in real
In particular , I should like to congratulate the two rapporteurs , Mrs Jim√©nez-Becerril Barrio and Mrs Romero L√≥pez , on their diligent work and on tackling the many problems encountered in
I should like to conclude , Madam President , by affirming how important it is to have close cooperation between the Member States as well as great sensitivity for the application of
We are now sending a powerful signal to the Council and the Commission that the European Parliament is keen to have this protection order and that it should enter
We should now try to overcome the opposition that there is to it in the Council as well as all the legal reasons that the Commission is putting forward
The directive needs to spell out what a victim's rights are and what the procedures are for lodging a complaint , and these are some of the things that I
The guarantee that protection granted to victims in one Member State will also apply in any other European Union Member State to which they are forced to travel for
It seems to me that only a protection mechanism which follows the victim can be fully effective and prevent a repeat of the same offence , as well as offering
(SK) Madam President , if the European Union is to become a genuine area of freedom , security and justice , we must eliminate the differences still persisting in this area between Member
It is good that this also provides an opportunity to deal with the situation of other potential victims , whether victims of human trafficking , forced marriages , honour killings or incest ,
Victims should be able to rely on clear rules and should always be informed about the measures that are available to them in their country of origin and in
However , the problem with this draft directive is that it is based on the most usual kind of stalking , in which a person has been a victim of violence
Unfortunately , however , these measures do not take into account the victims of organised crime who , in the majority of cases , do not need to be defended from an identified or
Therefore , I think that the European Parliament should regard this directive as a first step in implementing the Stockholm Programme , which talks expressly about measures to protect the victims
I appeal to the European Commission to ensure that the package of measures to protect victims , which is planned for 2011 , also protects victims of organised crime and victims injured
A positive aspect of this protection order is that it is to benefit every victim of violence as much as possible and its scope is broad: sexual violence , stalking
However , there is one fly in the ointment: the grounds for non-recognition in Article 9 are very extensive and may also , to some extent , represent a means for Member
Hostile parents often refuse to respect the decisions of courts from other countries granting custody of the children to one of them and simply take justice into their own
If , for example , forced marriages are now being prosecuted in Liechtenstein , even without the consent of the victim , and it is possible to take legal action in the case
(HU) Madam President , as a lawyer , I have dealt with cases of victims of violence against women and children for over ten years , whether it was domestic violence , rape or
trafficking in women; and I had the opportunity to see for myself that the protection order , which is the topic of today's debate , is one of the important and indispensable
Complex measures are required , such as legal advice , psychological support , support to the children concerned , and it is very important to listen to the victims , who are , I am
First , I would like to know to what extent they are involving the victims of violence against women in this work in order to enable them to share their
Secondly , I would like to know how familiar Mrs Reding and the rapporteurs are with the convention on violence against women that is currently under preparation by the European
Regardless of where victims are , it is a question here not only of them receiving physical protection from their aggressors , but also of their human dignity being taken into
With our political support for the European Protection Order Directive , we have given the issue the visibility it deserves and provided a Europe-wide , comprehensive package of special protection measures
The right to protection from violence is a basic human right regardless of ethnicity , legal status or immigration status , and it is therefore a moral duty for all of us
I am convinced that this new approach to the protection of vulnerable victims is a very strong political message with a view to strengthening freedom , security and justice within
In the hope that Parliament will adopt this report by a majority , I would like to address the Council and the Commission to remind them that we have overcome the
We should not therefore exclude ourselves , but rather help ourselves by adopting this more specific instrument today , and tomorrow by adopting the broader package of measures to help victims that
Let us help those who are looking to us today to give them a better life , a life that will restore to them their freedom , their security and , above
This is why it is so important that they are also included , and Parliament has worked , through all the amendments from the shadow rapporteurs , to ensure that all these victims
This is why it is so important that we work together on this issue , and why we regret the fact that Parliament and the Commission have not agreed on the
Commissioner , it does little to help victims of violence to consider that delaying the initiative by two , three or four years would be better for them , because that is not
The problem is that it has to be applied; the problem is that we need to take measures , and sometimes when measures need to be taken , they are legal
That is why we wanted Parliament to vote in favour by a huge majority , so that the countries that have not yet decided or have decided that they are against
The measures which will be part of the victims package include an overarching communication , the Lisbonisation of the 2001 framework decision on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings ,
We are finalising the impact assessment in order to determine the details of any actions on legislative and practical measures , with the aim of legal certainty and rapid and
Having said that , I would also like to inform this Parliament that , to date , four opinions have been sent by national parliaments on the protection order: positive ones from the
Italian , Greek and Portuguese parliaments and a negative opinion from the German Bundesrat arguing that the directive goes beyond the scope of Article 82 , as it covers non-criminal measures and
By carrying out a serious analysis before putting the legal and non-legal proposals on the table , I will try to propose measures which are sound enough not to victimise
In Romania , domestic violence incidents are estimated to affect 1 200 000 people every year , yet only 1% of the victims of violence are brave enough to report it to
Proactive measures are required to combat this phenomenon , along with amending the relevant legislative framework and establishing dialogue and cooperation between all the state institutions with powers in this
This will also include protection against acts of violence committed by groups of people and will apply to all victims of crime , such as victims of human trafficking , female

Approval of the Minutes
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed
Are there any comments
Mr President , I refer to an item in the Minutes concerning my report on ferry safety
The Minutes indicate that Mr Papoutsis answered my question in response to his statement to this House
In fact , the record should show that Mr Papoutsis gave me an undertaking that he would respond to my question in writing
I would appreciate it if the Minutes could be changed to reflect that particular assurance he gave this House
Mr Watts , I have taken note of that so that it can be corrected
Mr President , this is not really related to the Minutes , but today I must once again draw your attention to a very unpleasant state of affairs in Brussels
Two weeks ago , at 7
30 p

, one of my assistants was attacked in the vicinity of Parliament
I really do think that action should finally be taken - in the interests of Brussels and Belgium as well - to stop this kind of thing happening

I believe that all of us who work in the institutions have a right to live and work in safe surroundings
(Applause)
Mrs Schierhuber , I must admit that problems in this area of security are serious and have often occupied the Bureau's attention
Just the day before yesterday , Mrs Schleicher raised some problems of this kind
I admit that we still cannot deal with them and we will look into how we can do so more effectively
then we know for sure that nothing will ever come of it
it is now high time that we started meeting for longer and more often in Brussels
of course from other Members who have the same view
Now is not the time to begin discussing the issue
in Brussels only

European Conference/Malta
with enlargement
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , yesterday the European Conference met for the first time at foreign ministerial level
Foreign Minister , Mr Cotti , participated as members elect
Turkey had already indicated beforehand that it would not be taking part in the Conference
Discussions during the first Conference session centred on problems related to cross-border organised crime and regional cooperation on environmental issues
There was also an opportunity for a group photograph with our partners
During the working lunch , the situation in the western Balkans , in particular in Kosovo and Albania , was also discussed
topics which the Heads of State or Government , meeting in London , had agreed should be addressed by the Conference in the future
Let me now turn to the topics in detail
By way of an introduction under the heading of cross-border organised crime , the presidency reported on the work of the group of experts on drugs and organised crime
June in Brussels
At the meeting , participants expressed their support for the presidency proposals for the types of problem the group should address
Those from countries outside the EU then gave detailed information about the organised crime and drug-trafficking situations in their own countries
They informed the group about the action they are taking to combat these problems at home
All participants agreed that effective international cooperation must be guaranteed
This cooperation should be as broad as possible and include the police , customs authorities and criminal prosecution authorities
They also agreed that every effort should be made to ensure that information could be exchanged between those involved as quickly and smoothly as possible
In this context , it was also discussed whether structures to aid cooperation , or networks , already in existence within the European Union , should be extended
Those participating in the meeting of the group of experts also proposed an extensive list of topics for their further work
At the end of the discussion , it was agreed that several proposals , such as arranging contact points and inviting people to seminars , should be implemented quickly
It was decided that other ideas , for example measures on criminal prosecution and combating money laundering , should first be examined at further meetings
The group of experts will be meeting again under the Austrian Presidency
In moving to the main topics for discussion at the Conference , the presidency referred to the importance that the EU attaches to the fight against organised crime
politics , economics and the law
In the view of the European Union , two areas of organised crime are particularly abhorrent , because their victims are the weakest sections of society , children and migrants
children are the victims of a particularly detestable form of violence , that of sexual abuse
Usually this takes place behind closed doors
Such acts of violence are known to occur throughout the world
Since the advent of business , the exchange of information and tourism on a global scale , the sexual exploitation of children has been a matter of concern to all countries
The Conference participants agreed , for this reason , that effective measures to counter it also require productive international cooperation in the various fora
The reports on the discovery of cross-border paedophile rings are something we all recall with horror
but , we believe , to all states
The Conference participants here reaffirmed that these challenges should be tackled across national boundaries
reporting on the progress of discussions in the General Affairs Council
in February 1997
This joint action contains proposals for improving judicial cooperation in the fight against trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children
adopt
Finally , the Conference participants agreed to step up coordination in the United Nations , so as to fight together against the sexual abuse of children
Under the topic of cross-border organised crime , the Conference participants also discussed the problem of illegal immigrant couriers
Lately , in particular , there have been repeated reports about the huge influx of illegal migrants trying to reach the richer countries of Europe and North America
This new wave of migration , which is growing every year , has led some countries to tighten their immigration laws
The final topic discussed in the first session was that of regional cooperation on environmental issues
States and the Council for the European Arctic Regions of the Barents Sea
Conference participants emphasised that environmental policies should be complementary
Agency , to submit contributions and suggest solutions to the problems identified
of a subsequent debate
agenda the important issues that Mrs Ferrero has just raised
is of the utmost importance that they should be discussed in a forum which brings together all the future Member States and the current members of the European Union
It was particularly interesting yesterday to hear what the future Member States are doing or intend to do in these areas and how we can further strengthen cooperation
States
I am thinking here of the activities which the Amsterdam Treaty has transferred from the third pillar of the Maastricht Treaty to the first
This and all future presidencies can count on the Commission's support in putting these areas of cooperation into practice
These are all areas which are directly related to bringing Europe closer to the people and about which people are , I think , rightly very concerned
Mr President , looking at the screen in front of me I can see the words 'Conference' and 'Malta'
I am not sure whether I am supposed to say something about Malta now
to the presidency
As normally happens , the presidency and the Council have asked the Commission to deliver an opinion on it
and economic situation
Malta can best be reintegrated into the accession process
It is rather difficult to give a precise timetable for all this
in Malta
Minister of Foreign Affairs , and I told him that we are delighted that Malta has renewed its application
the European Union
and more people that this major political step that Malta is taking is both useful and necessary
the coalition that has just returned to power lost the last elections but one
It is another point on which clarification is needed
This is all I can tell you for the moment about Malta's application to join the European Union
Mr President , Madam President-in-Office , Commissioner , I believe the topics focused on by the European Conference to have been wisely chosen and worthy of our full support
for concern -whether this is justified or not - and to which they demand a response at European level
My colleague , Mrs Malone , in particular , will be commenting on Malta; I do not , therefore , wish to go into detail on that now
I should , however , like to make a number of fundamental remarks and ask a number of fundamental questions
European Conference as a kind of umbrella forum to negotiate with some of them , was the right way
these countries as applicants
Nevertheless , we must give them time and provide certain incentives for them to put the appropriate measures in place
I am glad that this has actually demonstrated that we proceeded in the right way , even though our course of action was disputed in certain quarters of this House
The incentives method - providing support for improvements on democracy , the rule of law and minorities - has proved to be the right method
We failed - unfortunately , at this European Conference too - to secure the participation of Turkey
I wonder how topics such as international crime , drug trafficking and so on can really be dealt with effectively without Turkey
I should also like to take this opportunity to express my particular concerns about the current strained relations between Turkey and its neighbour , Syria
Nobody should support terrorist groups and thus enable them to be active in other countries
in another country
be made to Turkey about its relations with Syria
as well as those in the European Conference
Both the countries of south-east Europe and those in the Barcelona process are , of course , very much affected by issues such as crime and drug trafficking , but also immigration
I wonder how these issues should be dealt with in the future
as it might have been , and the details still need to be considered
the countries in the Barcelona process are involved
I should like to ask you , Madam President-in-Office , whether you can comment on how people envisage this in the future
That apart , I would repeat that the issues you are addressing are of central importance for our continent
I wish the European Union every success with the European Conference , so that we can find solutions to these problems
you , Madam President-in-Office , because I had actually expected you to comment briefly on this in your statement
As vice-chairman of the Malta Delegation , I do , however , appreciate the opportunity to discuss this issue here today
that stage , along the same lines as those it made today
The Council now tells us that it is waiting for a Commission communication , so as to first ascertain its assessment of the situation
The procedure is rather bewildering , because on other enlargement issues , the Council has always taken the initiative
come after the preceding enlargement
Malta was then , as it were , catapulted into the ranks of those countries which are experiencing severe difficulties in preparing for accession to the European Union
In the two intervening years , Malta has not closed any doors
The government , too , in the meantime , has done all it can to give a subsequent government , of whatever political hue , the possibility to reactivate its application for membership
Besides , the Commission must certainly also have been aware of these signals from Malta , through the regular reports of its delegation
Malta and that Malta is now once again a part of the European Conference
For Malta belongs in this forum , if only because of its constructive role in the Barcelona process
will prove very helpful when eventually we have to move into the serious negotiations and the application of the new powers of the Amsterdam Treaty
will have the accession Conference , which is an integral part of the general Conference reported today , and marks an important psychological and political threshold
In that regard , with the Council and the Commission present , I wish to make a number of political points
My own Group , the ELDR , strongly believes in a wider and deeper political Union
own institutions urgently in advance , lest it become an obstacle later; none of us want to see that happen , but it has that capacity
Secondly , politically , we strongly welcome the green light which was given this week to Cyprus as part of that process
of the United Nations lest , again , we should institutionalise inside the Union an intractable and difficult problem on that divided island
Turkey
It is little wonder that Turkey does not participate
We really need to get our act together at Council level there and indicate a capacity for a maturing EU relationship with all the states in that region
My final political comment , in general terms , with regard to the upcoming Vienna Summit , is that this will afford an opportunity to review the claims of other applicant states
My Group believes , especially in the context of the Russian political and economic crisis , that we need to review our position with regard to the Baltic States
They have exhibited a deep commitment to reform and have made commendable progress
This must be recognised at Vienna as , indeed , must the renewed interest in Malta
Union
public national finances in Malta
comply with in the single currency system
accordance with commitments given by EU Heads of Government at Corfu
Malta are real and tangible
There will be access to a frontier-free trading bloc encompassing over 20 European countries , assuming that the accession negotiations with the countries of Eastern and Central Europe prove successful
markets for its domestic manufactured goods
Malta has a lot to gain if it manages to align itself more closely with EU membership rules
Signs of Malta's close ties with the EU are clearly evident on the island
In fact , one of Malta's stronger arguments for entry rests on the close affinities that exist between the island's economies and the European Union
Many industries in Malta which export a wide variety of semi-manufactured goods are owned by British , French , German and Italian companies
As a result , 66 % of the visible Maltese import and export business is done with EU states
Malta's other important cash income activity is tourism , which also depends on EU markets for its survival
However , many of Malta's administrative , legal and fiscal structures have already been aligned to European Union standards
The accession negotiations still have to overcome other difficult issues such as state support to industry and levies on imports , but I believe they can be overcome
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen
a forum for discussing issues in the common interest
That is a step in the right direction
and peace
of illegal immigrant couriers and is , if you will forgive me , Madam President-in-Office , hypocritical
Regional cooperation , on the other hand , is an important step in the right direction
this time , but will allow the regions to develop in parallel and along the same lines
Finally , I hope , Mr van den Broek , that your Directorate-General will at last take a step in the right direction , and amalgamate the PHARE and Interreg funds
Mr President , Madam President of the Council , Commissioner , I would like to speak about Malta , because today is a very important day for Europe and , I believe , for Malta itself
European Union put on the agenda for this part-session , in the presence of the Council and the Commission
As chairman of the delegation to the EU-Malta Joint Parliamentary Committee , I have been a privileged and attentive observer of Maltese political life for two years
prevail over partisan interests
peoples of Europe a similar common destiny , a destiny that included , on the eve of the reunification of the continent , full membership of the European Union
I am convinced that after having made certain necessary technical adjustments , Malta can be immediately integrated into the enlargement process
In fact , agreements were reached in 1995 that stated that negotiations with Malta and Cyprus would begin six months after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference
Therefore , I personally believe that , in accordance with these agreements , it should be possible to begin accession negotiations with Malta in January 1999
I truly hope that a decision in this direction will be taken by the Vienna European Council in December
There is an additional reason why we should be pleased with the relaunching of Malta's application to join the Union
On an institutional level , Malta's return will mean that the process of institutional reform will have to be speeded up
This is a necessary condition , in Parliament's opinion at least , for successful enlargement
when the Union is faced with the prospect of having 20 members , which would be the case here
Without Malta , the Union , Europe , would never feel complete
Mutual coexistence will constantly enrich both parties , Europe and Malta
It will also be an important asset in relations between the Union and the Mediterranean countries involved in the Barcelona process
consideration should be given to whether , from the point of view of its infrastructure , Malta is in any kind of a position to run a Council presidency
A similarly small country such as Luxembourg , for example , cooperates with Belgium in this respect
No such possibility is open to Malta
Secondly , I believe that it is essential that value added tax , which has been abolished in Malta , should be reintroduced
unacceptable competitive advantage
But , with your permission , I will close with a general comment on the value of the European Conference
This instrument was created , as a matter of urgency , as a forum for dialogue between the EU and Turkey
The fact that this state has again failed to participate should give EU strategists cause to rethink their policy on this matter
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the Presidency and the Commission for the reports they have presented to us here today
here this week in Parliament
We did ourselves debate the whole question of the harmonisation of the pharmaceutical industry
membership of the European Union
by the opposition , that there will be a referendum held on the conclusion of the negotiations
That is of vital importance
Treaty
see if and how they can catch up on the past two years while the application was frozen
My Group will also , by way of amendment , be defending Parliament's absolute right to express our opinion on the Commission's updated opinion on Malta's renewed application
We consider that Malta has a natural vocation , both in terms of its democratic institutions and respect for human rights , to form an integral part of the European Union
We look forward to receiving the Commission's analysis of the economic and political developments since the freezing of the previous application in 1996
with some small industries and so on
There is also the whole question of neutrality which has not been touched on
I know this is a very sensitive and divisive issue in Malta as indeed it is in other Member States including Ireland
for all on their future place in the European Union
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin by congratulating our friend , Prime Minister Eddy Fenech Adami , on his recent electoral success in Malta
line taken by the previous Fenech Adami government , and which obtained a favourable opinion from our institutions in 1995
to the possibility of including Malta in the first round of negotiations on enlargement , but should also give us great satisfaction
and return to the Maastricht criteria - already achieved in the recent past - will reward this country's legitimate aspirations to join the monetary union
We need only recall that in 1995 , Malta achieved a deficit of 3
9 % of GDP and inflation of 2
9 % , and that the Maltese lira has been pegged to the ECU for eleven years
the cultures and economies of third countries and of the European Union
given , that Malta should be considered in the first round of negotiations for EU enlargement by 2002
I should like to hear the views of the Council presidency on this point
at the last minute thanks to the prompt on the screen
We have not heard anything from the Council , although I am assuming that this will be covered in the response at the end
Mediterranean presence in the European Union should be a little larger
The Barcelona process could certainly do with a little consolidation
It is also a clear illustration of the fact that Europe is expanding not just towards the east , but towards the whole of the continent of Europe
membership , and we naturally support the calls for a referendum here
Finally , I do not think we need to adopt a paternalistic attitude towards Malta
waves , which is that it is very easy to move from the second to the first
This is what we want to see
Mr President , I was delighted to hear the report from the Council on the activities in the European Conference
It is clearly a very thorough conference
the battle against crime
It is important to know how seriously governments are now taking the way crime undermines the basis of a democratic society
I am pleased the conference was able to find a mechanism to deal with these problems now rather than wait until we have negotiated full European Union membership
I believe it is a step forward in the security of the continent
I am particularly pleased to hear that attention is being focused on one group of people who are often ignored by politicians , namely children
return to Europe of slavery
movement in the single market are the murderers , the blackmailers , the criminals , the junkies , the paedophiles
We must make it very clear that we are not prepared to allow them to abuse what we wanted as economic benefits
I would like to hear the Council say something about what it feels is the future of the European Conference
Mr Swoboda has already mentioned certain countries which he feels should participate in the conference
I would add to that list Ukraine
I believe that is important because Ukraine is tied very closely to the West
I would like to hear the presidency give us its observations about where we go from here in the conference , because it can be a major force
On Malta , like everybody else I welcome the decision by the Maltese Government to apply for European Union membership
But we must not get carried away
This is not the return of the prodigal son
This is not the opportunity to slay a few fatted calves and have a feast
This is simply a democratic government expressing the will of its people
Our enthusiasm must not blind us toward the many problems that come with Malta
EU membership still remains a political football , which is not the best way to prepare for full membership of the European Union
Secondly , the Commission in its avis identified certain weaknesses , particularly in relation to the structure of the economy
What we have to do now is look again at the situation in Malta and judge it on the same basis as any other country
Talk of Malta jumping to the front of the queue - which I have heard in Parliament - is nonsense
Malta has to be judged the same as any other country
But we are delighted that it is part of our family again
forms of slavery , subjects which we hope to return to on other occasions for further consideration
the matter of Malta's accession to the European Union
have before us a firm request for accession from the new Maltese Government
We should like to hear more warmth , as much enthusiasm for Malta as for the other applicant countries
Malta is not demanding special favours , Mr Titley
Its Prime Minister has declared his intention to comply with the Maastricht criteria in full
full , and now it needs to catch up again
As for the neutrality issue which has been raised here , the Prime Minister has singled it out and said that the problem can be solved
So Malta has all its papers in order
I do not believe that a credible Mediterranean policy can be pursued without Malta being a member of the European Union
The benefits would be considerable , especially as the Mediterranean will be a major policy area over the next few years
It is our second main border , and we cannot tackle the problem of large-scale migration unless we conduct a serious policy , in conjunction with Barcelona
Malta is a much-needed protagonist in all of this; that is why we are strongly in favour of Malta's accession to the European Union
we did take the first available opportunity
that to discuss the subject
I believe that a very positive signal was sent out yesterday
be re-examined and revised
namely the updating of the opinion
Malta
I should like to make that quite clear
On the contrary , we are delighted that Malta is back on board , if I may put it like that
Secondly , I should briefly like to mention Syria and Turkey
degree of calm to the situation
in those countries which are not applicants or have no prospect of acceding at the present time
Unfortunately , perhaps because it had not been prepared in sufficient detail , many countries provisionally rejected this idea in Salzburg , saying that it was premature
I myself believe , however , that opportunities will certainly also be provided in the future for these countries - Ukraine , Moldova , Belarus , etc
to at least have the prospect of working in collaboration with Europe
As regards institutional reform , which was also mentioned , I should like to say that it will soon be the P√∂rtschach summit
course , soon be back on the agenda as part of the follow-up to ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty
But obviously , we know that institutional reform is one of the preconditions for our really being in a position to accept further applicants for membership
all the countries in the first wave - five plus one , Cyprus - on 10 November
This could not be taken for granted , and we struggled over it to the last
It is , therefore , all the more gratifying that we have managed it
in close contact with the UN Secretary-General , Kofi Annan
too , talks are being held with both sides , but as yet we have not achieved a breakthrough
We will continue our efforts , to the end of our presidency at the very least
I should like to make one more point on migration
Although we will be debating migration issues next , I simply cannot let the accusation stand that our action in this respect is hypocritical
Convention on the Status of Refugees and its instruments; in fact , it was only referring to complementary protection measures
Incidentally , there has been cooperation on migration and asylum within the European Union for longer than you think
But I will say more about that during the next debate
The debate is closed
I have received seven motions for resolutions on this subject pursuant to Rule 37(2)
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
Situation in Kosovo
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Kosovo
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is now exactly three weeks since I last spoke to you on the subject of Kosovo
Since then , the situation has again worsened dramatically
The High Commissioner for Refugees , Sadako Ogata , visited Kosovo , Montenegro and Albania just last week
forests and hills
Almost every day , more displaced people join them
Belgrade's repeated proclamations that the fighting was being stopped and the Serbian forces withdrawn have proved to be either untrue , or a tactical manoeuvre on the part of President Milosevic
suffering of the displaced people and make it possible for them to return home very soon
The reality , as perceived by Mrs Ogata and regularly reported by the KDOM , tells a different story
that the Serbian security forces are waging a campaign of terror and violence against the civilian population in Kosovo
Unfortunately , it is all too obvious that , given that winter is approaching , we are heading for a humanitarian catastrophe , unless the situation changes soon
The Kosovo Albanians currently seeking refuge in the forest have no fresh drinking water , increasingly scarce supplies of food , no sanitation and no medicines
The situation is , therefore , particularly serious for children , the elderly and the sick
the Government of Serbia and Yugoslavia , that is to say with Milosevic himself
the attacks carried out by the KLA
Obviously , the KLA bears some of the responsibility for the worsening security situation , but we should keep a sense of proportion
As for the European Union , what I said three weeks ago still stands
It demands an immediate halt to the violence and early negotiations to find a political settlement to the crisis
this as the most important starting point for any negotiated solution
The Union is particularly active in the humanitarian field
In the margins of the United Nations General Assembly , EU foreign ministers agreed to appoint the Austrian Ambassador in Belgrade , Wolfgang Petritsch , as special EU envoy to Kosovo
Two days ago , the Council also adopted the corresponding formal decisions
as a point of contact for the Belgrade government and as an intermediary between it and Kosovo's political leaders
Russia , UNHCR , the ICRC , and the ECMM and KDOM observer missions
return , in safety and with dignity
Within the last few days , the presidency has also presented 'Project Home' to its EU partners
This initiative aims to make it easier for displaced people living in the open in the Komorane and Lapusnik area to return home
In addition , it provides for a number of accompanying , confidence-building measures
Admittedly , all initiatives of this kind were called into question by renewed clashes and fear of further persecution , destruction and massacres
tortured and murdered
without delay and punish those responsible
Furthermore , it requested all those involved to cooperate with the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the investigation of these crimes
of experienced forensic experts to Kosovo
The resulting invitation from Belgrade University to a forensic team from Helsinki University on 2 October , represents the first modest fruits of our efforts
Finally , from the Union's point of view , I should also like to recall the decisions the EU made on sanctions
lastly banning the Yugoslav airlines from flying and landing
More far-reaching measures can only be taken with the support of a qualified majority of EU States
were an embargo on Belgrade
In the same way , it is agreed that , wherever possible , Montenegro should not suffer as a result of the sanctions applied
Nevertheless , at the most recent Council meeting , in Luxembourg , it was decided to examine the gaps in the current sanction regime and make proposals to close them
In the Council's discussions and many other events over the last few days , however , another more fundamental development has become apparent
A certain shift of opinion on the crisis in Kosovo can be observed within the international community
There is increasingly clear support for tougher action from the international community
Resolution 1199 , adopted by the United Nations Security Council on 23 September , was the first outward sign of this
the international community's patience is running out
There is no doubt that the decisions which lie ahead are also of tremendous significance for the European Union
After all , they affect the security and stability of the whole continent
For the sake of the presidency , which is involved in the work of the Contact Group , I do not wish to pre-empt these decisions
in Kosovo continue
decisions are not implemented immediately and in full
displaced persons
A tough response towards President Milosevic , of course
But what use are all these tough statements
to act , with political and diplomatic pressure and economic sanctions
a way that the Member States are forced to take tough measures without backing down
I am thinking here of the ban on flights which , as far as I know , is still not being complied with by all the Member States
is allowed or not
It is not primarily for the Commission to answer this question
We can have an opinion on it , but it is only one of many
go ahead on the basis of a 'coalition of the willing'
solution , is removed , by military force if necessary
We have often discussed the lessons to be learnt from Bosnia , and now history is repeating itself and another humanitarian disaster is looming
Once it is too late we will all agree that we should have acted earlier
It took 300 000 people to die in Bosnia before we realised this - how many will it take in Kosovo
Since Resolution 1199 , there have been 15 to 20 000 new refugees and displaced persons
cleansing is still going on at this very minute
Belgrade will issue new invitations to representatives of the UN , the OSCE , perhaps even the EU and the Council of Europe
Endless talking against a background of endless shooting
This may be my frustration talking , but I feel that we must take every opportunity to condemn this process as unacceptable
such measures , is currently facing a serious financial , economic and political crisis at home
in Moscow
Those who are the worst affected after the refugees themselves are other countries in the region or in western Europe
So there are very clear interests at stake in ensuring that this destabilisation and humanitarian disaster are not allowed to happen
I have nothing more to add to what the presidency has already expressed in very clear terms
have the power to decide give a clear , unequivocal response
Mr President , for nine years I have sat in this Chamber and heard lots of pleas for a common foreign and security policy
could be fitted onto an institutional shelf
They were not talking about an effective policy and were not concerned about the effectiveness of its outcome
This week all my suspicions have been proved absolutely correct
these Members represent are the countries which are not prepared to take action on Kosovo
When the going gets tough , the tough talkers sit on their hands
That is unacceptable
The common foreign and security policy is being seen as a total sham
the European Union , the Council of Ministers , simply not prepared to do anything
I am not naturally somebody who instinctively talks about military action: I am naturally cautious
Since my son recently joined the British Royal Air Force , military intervention is no longer an intellectual debate but is now a personal issue for me
But I cannot accept that we continue to allow babies to have their throats cut while we sit around having ever more byzantine arguments about legal bases
Resolution 1199 is enough to justify military action
Milosevic is not adhering to Resolution 1199
How many more hurdles do we want to invent to excuse inaction
I say to the Council: how many people have to die before it does something about Kosovo
Let us have action
No more words , no more hurdles , no more intellectual arguments about how many laws you can get on the end of a pin
Enough is enough
Do something
Mr President , Madam President-in-Office: hear , hear , Mr Titley
so as to put an end to all that he has so forcefully denounced here
Thank you very much , Mr Titley; I hope we will adopt a resolution along those lines today
All diplomacy could achieve with Milosevic was a scornful smile at so much Western stupidity
Hitherto , he has always simply taken our weakness as a licence to continue the genocide in Bosnia and now in Kosovo
Unfortunately , however , the situation is even more unsavoury
apartheid
Suddenly Mr Rugova is the most important man
Why , then , did no one help him over the eight years that he led his people in peaceful resistance , hoping for our support
The crocodile tears which the West now sheds for Mr Rugova , the contravened sanctions and the empty threats are all signs of helpless political disarray
And now the countdown has started
It has started , but , we might well ask , where will it end
What does come after a military strike , which I have been calling for for so long in this House
in Kosovo , removing their fears of extermination , and granting them self-determination of their affairs
guilty because it did not give itself up to be eaten and because the poor spectators were forced to look on pityingly
That is how it will end , and I very much regret it
I hope that the Council , the Commission and the international community will see reason and come to the aid of the people of Kosovo , who are dying every day
Mr President , in Kosovo we have seen torture , burnt-out villages and violence against men , women and children - and a great deal of it
Just as there has been a great deal of talk in this House and at the United Nations , but we have not actually done anything
I am filled with dismay , especially since I get the feeling that a number of today's speakers have some sympathy for the Serbian position
Maybe they want Serb forces to crush the Kosovo Liberation Army before we undertake any steps
That would soften up Kosovo , rendering it more pliable over the question of continued union with Serbia
Despite all the fine-sounding resolutions , I sense that some people would not mind seeing the violence go on
Afterwards it would be that much easier to impose a solution
Take Mr Titley , who just had the floor
His actions to date could well have helped bring about what has happened in Kosovo
He won applause today for saying that we must intervene
Yet when he himself could have intervened , when he could have demanded that measures be taken , he did nothing of the sort
I read in the newspaper this morning that President Bill Clinton is now saying that the time has come to end the violence in Kosovo
That time came a long time ago , in my opinion
come
Our own humanist values are on the line
Let us demonstrate that democracy can muster a little strength at least
Mr President , there are a number of questions I should like to ask
Why has the war criminal President Milosevic not yet been brought before the tribunal in The Hague
This would have solved part of the problem
Yesterday evening I was in contact with the opposition in Belgrade
Mr Draskovic told me that if there is an air strike he will fight to defend his country
hole and the opposition will find things very difficult'
People in Europe see refugees shivering in the cold and expect the international community to do something
Air strikes perhaps , but what does the EU plan to do afterwards
Is the Council aware of the divisions within the KLA
How will it negotiate
Air strikes will simply provoke all these groups to take action
The Serbs will resist , knowing their partisan mentality
Is the Council prepared to support an international initiative to provide ground troops to break Serbia's resistance and protect the people of Kosovo
Does it think that a forensic examination of all these terrible murders should be taken into account when deciding on air strikes
Is anything known about the outcome of the talks between Rugova and Holbrooke
If all diplomatic efforts fail , we have no choice but to order air strikes , and I support this
But I still think that the scenario after the air strikes is not clear and has not been thought through properly
This brings me back to my first point: Milosevic must be brought before the tribunal and part of the problem will be solved
Mr President , I really do feel that , at this stage , we could do without speeches and meetings
I believe we have to make very clear statements and , in particular , specific requests to the Council
ethnic cleansing
We are also certain that he will ignore Security Council Resolution 1199 , as he did all the preceding ones
In the face of all this , what is the key question
The key question is whether Milosevic really believes that the international community is prepared to implement the measures it announces with monotonous regularity every two or three weeks
I believe that the European Community must take some simple steps
For instance , the Council should urge the United Nations to adopt a resolution to implement Resolution 1199 , military action and humanitarian aid
implement the United Nations resolutions and which are not
I also feel that , on the whole , public opinion needs a clear signal on this matter
on Serbia becoming a democratic country
In this connection , I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council if the latter is really prepared to support Mr Gonz√°lez and act on his recommendations
Finally , I earnestly hope that this Parliament will not become a laughing-stock and fail to agree on a resolution on Kosovo , as happened a few weeks ago , in September
Mr President , this situation is nothing short of surreal
Obviously , we are in favour of air strikes in Kosovo or on the Serbs
The question is , who can make the decision
It can only happen if there is a proposal from the United Nations , a Security Council decision on the basis of a proposal by Mr Annan
But , now you are saying , if they are not in a position to do this , then
of air strikes , not yet ordered his troops in Bosnia to catch Karadzic
There are 50 000 soldiers there
strikes
Everyone knows that this is not the way heroes behave
Mrs van Bladel is right there
If we want to have a say in Kosovo , then we have to be prepared to leave 30 000 soldiers there for a certain period of time
You are right there , Mrs Pack
But then we have to actually do what we say
And that means not discussing air strikes , which will not solve anything , but doing some straight talking about the action we need to take
I ask you: why did we not do this in Bosnia
Why do we not make sure that all those who should go to The Hague actually do go there
We mentioned Karadzic
That is why I do not believe any of you
I do not believe you when you say that you want a solution
You know that the situation is unbearable in Kosovo
This fact is unbearable for all of us
But , Mr Titley , you have a stake in Mr Blair
You all have a stake in some government somewhere , on which we are not getting a return
All of a sudden , we are playing at being strong
situation it always responds in the same way and is never in a position to implement what we have the potential to do
be blackmailed by Russia
Mr van den Broek , if you can speak so plainly with us , then speak plainly with Mr Primakov for once as well
The solution is also to be found in Moscow
'No money if there is no change in Kosovo , ' in whatever language you like
That is what you need to tell the Russians
Say it clearly , and your colleagues Trittin and Fischer should say it , and all the rest
Then there will be change in Kosovo
Mr President , Madam President of the Council , Commissioner , I think we must all be mad
For six months , our only policy has been to bury our heads in the sand
Today , we are going through the motions
We are flexing our muscles
But what are we going to do
We are going to launch missiles which will simply strengthen Mr Milosevic's regime
That is the policy of Pontius Pilate
there will be no solution for the entire Yugoslav population
We need to take this on board and begin to take measures and define a policy
to be able to conclude the Dayton Agreement and to divide Bosnia
Today , three years after this agreement was implemented , no-one can claim that it has been a success
Less than 20 % of the displaced people have returned to their homes
There are fine programmes such as HOME and others which are designed to enable 300 000 Kosovan refugees to return to their region
Milosevic will not allow this
He is currently implementing a policy of partition in Kosovo
Montenegro
him to strengthen his control over an increasingly reluctant ally: Montenegro
That is Milosevic's policy
It is perfectly clear
Faced with that , the European Union has no policy
a nationalist-communist regime
Instead , the only thing we should be doing is bringing that regime down
with Milosevic being taken directly from Belgrade to The Hague to appear before the International War Crimes Tribunal
That does not require any special financing
It is a political measure that the European Union can take tomorrow morning by sending the appropriate signals
Mr President , unfortunately in Kosovo we are witnessing the umpteenth Balkan tragedy , but as always we utter the same predictable and futile words
However hard we in this House have tried to hurl curses or to trust in the prospect of peace , the facts remain the same
Europe has been unable , incapable or unwilling to play a political role in preventing the massacres which have been going on for months now
political unification , so much so that Europe , bereft of a common foreign policy , now counts for nothing whatsoever
lost in the dark past of Balkan history
I would remind you that in the fourteenth century , the Muslims put all the Kosovan Serbs to death by the sword and brought in Albanians
Ours is still the Europe of individual foreign ministers , isolated policies and the interests of nations which regard themselves as the strongest
free from constraints and conditions , and that at the same time the Member States' Foreign Ministers should refrain from cultivating bilateral relations with this or that rival faction
Milosevic has been able to act undisturbed , in the knowledge of Europe's cowardliness
relying on action from the United States alone , allowing that country to go on asserting its hegemony over others
Mr President , I think it is time to draw a line under the situation in Kosovo
The hour is fast approaching when action must be taken , as I think everyone here would agree
Despite all the international pressure that has been brought to bear we still have not managed to put an end to the violent repression
The report by Secretary-General Kofi Annan confirms that Belgrade is thumbing its nose at the UN demands , for which the report harshly criticises it
The guilty party has been clearly identified , as we asked
The mission by the American envoy Richard Holbrooke has so far been a failure
President Milosevic seems bent on out-and-out conflict and is clearly counting on support from Russia
Either that , or he is playing cat-and-mouse as he did before , and plans to agree to some concession or other at the last minute
We must not on any account be drawn into such games and must put an end to this situation , as I said
about their terrible plight and we cannot wait much longer to get humanitarian aid to those who are suffering
Winter is approaching , as people have pointed out
I say that I welcome possible military action by NATO because I realise that a political solution , however desirable it may be , is becoming increasingly unlikely
Belgrade refuses to budge and clearly expects us to accept the present situation , but this is out of the question
The Security Council must decide in the next few days on whether to take military action
If Milosevic refuses to budge , such action will become inevitable , in my view
We would urge the Council to play an active part in this process
It would be irresponsible to delay any longer , and the European Union must also adopt a clear stance here
of international law
The people of Kosovo cannot understand this , nor can our own citizens
I hope that Russia does not force us to choose between our principles and our relations with it
If it does , I would choose to stand by our principles
We do not want military intervention
President Milosevic has forced our hand and he must now face the consequences
by the international Contact Group and the UN
undertake action of this kind
But until the Treaty is ratified , this is just pie in the sky
for a political solution to the Kosovo crisis
The crisis of credibility - and this is the tragic part - does not just affect the European Union , however
action will not come , because of opposition from Russia and China
even a consensus within the Austrian Government about our security options
Mr President , this morning we witnessed another show , another performance , on the television news
sort of Barnum's Circus caravan
At least that is what Milosevic would have us believe , one of the many yarns that he spins us , given that every week he tells us he is withdrawing
well , this morning I have heard them call with great conviction for military action , intervention and bombing
I , on the other hand , have long denounced Europe's impotence in respect of Kosovo
after military intervention
Do you believe that the problem will be solved by dropping bombs on Kosovo
I believe that with Milosevic we need to act immediately , so as to salvage some of our democratic credibility
Foreign Affairs , who even now still believe that Milosevic can be a reliable partner
Mr President , in the Middle Ages , monks used to call meat fish and were therefore easy in their consciences when they ate it
Here today , we are doing just about the same thing
We are calling NATO bombardments a humanitarian enterprise and a mission of peace
That is hypocrisy in all its glory
Peoples are not laboratory animals on which the European Union can test its ability to exercise the foreign policy of an international police force
the European Union's bodies because they have not yet taken military action
attack can achieve this
and in Yugoslavia as a whole
disobeying the new world order
In 1990 it was the people of Iraq , who , I might add , are still subject to sanctions which are responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of children
In 1991 , it was the Croatians , guilty then of the double crime of freeing themselves from the federal and communist straitjacket of Yugoslavia
Our European leaders , particularly Jacques Delors , threatened them
Mr Santer , President of the Council and head of the Luxembourg Government , even went so far as to claim that Croatia was not large enough to become a country
which communist armies have become associated
At that time , we were the only ones who condemned this complicity , who maintained that our governments would have a heavy responsibility to bear for the Balkan unrest
Similarly , we had warned the nationalist Serbian leaders that they were committing a fatal error by becoming comrade Milosevic's back-up troops
their southern border
The danger was not Croatia; it was the resurgence of Islamic fundamentalism
Today , Serbia risks losing all , or at least part , of its province of Kosovo where , in less than two generations , there has been a demographic revolution
birth rate
learn from this
from NATO's air force
Today it is the Serbian people , dragged into this deadlock by their communist leaders , who are being put in the dock by internationalists
NATO is getting ready to bomb Serbia
That will not resolve anything; it will only serve to inflame the Balkan situation further
Army
What did it do in 1953 for the people of Berlin
Nothing
What did it do in 1956 when Soviet tanks violated Hungary's sovereignty and entered Budapest
Nothing
What did it do in 1968 in Prague
Nothing
It has done nothing after 70 years of communist terror , after one hundred million deaths
Was this out of cowardice in the face of the USSR or was it due to complacency
Although , today , I have no sympathy for the Serbian methods of repression , I cannot help but find it incongruous to hear a few people expressing such manly , warlike sentiments
massacres took place in Sudan , there was total and absolute silence
But Christians are inferior human beings who can no doubt be massacred at will , because they do not form part of the new world order
Mr President , we need to express our frustration , but we must also send out messages , because we are trying to present military action as an alternative to political action
I must remind you that the most powerful weapon at the disposal of any parliament is the spoken word and , in my opinion , we can send out three messages
The most important of these must be to the Serbian people , the first victim of that apparatchik turned nationalist , which is what Milosevic is
He has laid a carefully planned trail of destruction: beginning in Slovenia , continuing in Bosnia and turning his attention now to Kosovo
It is worth mentioning that we have checked his progress on occasion
In December 1996 , Felipe Gonz√°lez , our special envoy at the time , succeeded in making Milosevic admit that the elections had been fraudulent
Milosevic lost the support of the people , who turned against him
However , he is an experienced apparatchik , and regained the lost ground in four months
Essentially , he is an expert in survival
possible , and that the onus is on them to reverse the situation
would provoke a nationalist reaction which could be in his favour
I do feel that this message should go out to the Serbian people because he really has become an outcast from the international community
Secondly , as regards Russia , we do have a significant relationship with that country , as Commissioner van den Broek has mentioned
I believe that now is the time to raise this issue and to deal with it seriously within the framework of our relationship with Russia
To conclude , I think there is another important message for the Council and for the Commission
of Community political representatives should troop off to Belgrade
This enables Milosevic to exploit any divisions between us , and also places him in a position of power
We should be consistent here
If we appoint envoys , it is for them to deal with Milosevic when appropriate
but to achieve a lasting solution
Then in five months' time we will not need to start complaining all over again about the latest chapter in that gentleman's murderous and destructive history
western Europe and Russia an excuse to do nothing
I particularly welcome the fact that the President-in-Office spoke so unreservedly about this
to underline how much it values the role it plays in international peace and security
On the subject of the Council , our general view is that it has not acted particularly effectively
the huge numbers of victims
which sounds absolutely ridiculous given the seriousness of the situation
It also indicates that the Council's position may not be guided by the best possible motives
ways to get round the ban on investment , and nobody even knows how the visa restrictions are supposed to work
moral questioning of our citizens have too little effect on policy
intervention in Rwanda
I would also make the following point to the Commissioner: he said he understood Slav solidarity , but I think this is a very dangerous thing to say to the Russians
People in the Netherlands did not show solidarity with white South Africans during the apartheid regime
The law must prevail , not demonstrations of ethnic solidarity
We must not give the Russians the impression that we will tolerate it
happening
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , European foreign policy cannot consist of successively demonizing countries as dictated by American interests and their new world order
10 years after the end of the Cold War
Europeans should finally be left to deal with the conflicts within Europe and to build up their own security system themselves
Why do we have to have this eternal American supervision
Furthermore , the current global media campaign against Yugoslavia is quite simply scandalous
What is happening is , of course , appalling on a human level
We all agree on that
However , does a substantial part of the responsibility not also lie with the Kosovan terrorists who want to change the borders and separate Kosovo from Serbia
Why have we never spoken too of the bullying that has been inflicted on the Serbian minority in Kosovo for many years
The indignation is all one-sided and peace will never be achieved unless we respect the integrity of Serbian territory
Humiliating this nation through sanctions will not bring any sort of viable or humane solution
Mr President , Madam President-in-Office , Commissioner , I have now listened to the debate and heard much criticism and strongly-worded contributions
I believe that we all need a clear idea of what we want , and how we intend to go about achieving it
government
indeed use ground forces if Milosevic does not give in
the Kosovo Albanians about a new structure for Yugoslavia
This may make NATO air strikes or air operations necessary
situation
then we will have to be involved for many , many years
In my view , it would be a great mistake to believe that a handshake or a short attack on strategic targets would achieve anything
have to maintain a presence there for some considerable time
I should like to say to Mr Oostlander that Austria has in fact already played an active role in other NATO operations , such as in Bosnia
So , I do not see any reason for any stumbling blocks there - the EU has to realise this
Obviously , I fully support all the efforts being made to win over Russia and China
in Kosovo all the same
my conscience as a European
extent on the back of the NATO troops or whoever it might be
No , the KLA has to exercise the same restraint
that back-up operations on the ground will also be necessary immediately afterwards , to provide humanitarian aid and , at long last , to achieve a political solution in Kosovo
Greece - and two candidates for membership of the European Union - Bulgaria and Romania - have ended up by agreeing on joint action concerning the issue we call Kosovo
established a tripartite military force precisely so that those countries , which are directly affected by what happens in Kosovo , will be able to deal with any consequences of the situation
Our first concern is the protection of Albania , and of course the defence of our own frontiers too
I will agree and say that everything the various speakers have said here is correct , given the standpoint from which it was all said
it will have to be an action stemming from a predetermined policy
We cannot go ahead with military interventions in a vacuum , but only if those military interventions take place within the framework of a political solution
we convey to the Serbian people
we stand by them to offer support if they wish to go in search of solutions which , however , they must find for themselves
the debate we are having in the plenary today
the Socialist Group - Messrs Titley , Wiersma and Swoboda - were not able to foresee at the time what was actually going to happen in this country
At that time , we knew exactly what was going to happen
So , what has happened over the last month
What has changed
would
of miracle
In this respect , it increasingly seems to me that anything in which the United Nations has a hand comes to nothing
countries , and which is dealt with in exactly the same way there , as we are seeing in Serbia and Kosovo at the present time
By way of an example , I recall what we saw in Russia during the war in Chechnya; that was a very similar situation
And we see China treating its colonies in much the same way
We cannot expect these countries to have a sudden change of heart , and so we cannot wait for a miracle from the United Nations
Madam President-in-Office , you rightly said that our patience is running out
It has to be said , I believe , that our patience actually ought to have run out some time ago
We see what is coming; we see what is happening here , and it is unacceptable
There are only a few possible solutions - I have to grant you that , Mr Swoboda: he gave a very accurate picture of the military option and its implications
Milosevic come to The Hague and that negotiations be held , not with him , but about him
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I will certainly give the Council a detailed report on the general feeling in this House , which has been clearly expressed in today's debate
Obviously , I also believe that the use of military force - as mentioned in the debate - cannot in itself automatically resolve the political problems
the adversaries back to the negotiating table
That should also be stated quite clearly
its responsible role as a permanent member of the UN Security Council
I am also saying this because Moscow should be aware that Milosevic has not in any way kept the promises he made to President Yeltsin either
Opinions on the question - raised by several speakers - of the legal basis for military action against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , have hitherto diverged in the European Union
I have already mentioned that intensive consultations are underway in the United Nations and NATO at the present time
on this issue
behalf of the EU presidency
community simply cannot stand and watch , when there is an endless series of massacres and acts of violence in Kosovo , and the threat of a humanitarian catastrophe
Finally , I should like to address one more issue you raised
be appropriate , on the Bosnian model for example
These kinds of issues are under consideration at the present time , but it is too early to go into more detail
Mr President , I very much support what the presidency said , including the last comments
crimes against humanity
I think we can expect a country like Russia , which we regard as our partner , not to do such a thing
We are not asking it for active cooperation , but we must oppose Russia's use of any sort of veto
That is what I meant
the problems and repercussions of possible military intervention and to make it clear that it is time for action , not words
Discussions are already advanced about whether a military presence will be required afterwards
NATO is not naive
that may not be the end of it and a political solution may not automatically emerge
situation and has opted for a military rather than a political solution
We need to change this state of affairs , but as I said the time has now come for action , not words
would be unexceptional in the British House of Commons
So I feel I need to respond by making it clear - as I did in my speech - that I have always supported diplomatic solutions to this problem
That is not inconsistent with taking the view that we have now reached the end of the road in that respect
I want to make that position absolutely clear
I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2)
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon

VOTES
I would inform the House that Amendments Nos 1 and 2 are inadmissible
That is the decision of the Chair
Mr President , on behalf of the PPE Group , I wish to propose that the Miranda report be referred back to committee
I wish to stress that this is no reflection upon the work of Mr Miranda and the Committee on Budgetary Control
In fact I described his report yesterday as courageous
As you mentioned , there was a difficulty with two amendments
For the first amendment , which I put down under the Rule which requires 29 signatures , I got 43 without any difficulty from four political groups
One wonders how many signatures and political groups would be required for the amendment to become acceptable
The second amendment was exactly the same as a group amendment
and alter the wording accordingly , in which case a report could go forward with general support
We therefore have a request for referral back to committee , pursuant to Rule 129
I shall ask if there is a speaker in favour , a speaker against and , if necessary , seek the opinion of the rapporteur
Mr President , I should like to express my support for a request from the PPE Group
I believe that the Miranda report , which was the subject of considerable work in the Committee on Budgetary Control , should be more detailed in the section on Parliament
own institution
As regards the problem raised by Mr Kellett-Bowman , I must say that it is not new
power to examine the merits of amendments
When we want to declare something inadmissible , we move a motion of inadmissibility
We do not just declare like that that an amendment is inadmissible
Therefore , for all these reasons , I support the request made by Mr Kellett-Bowman on behalf of the PPE Group
I would urge that this report should not be referred back to committee
supported by a large majority
On the subject of the amendments , it is true that two were declared inadmissible
committee just because of those two amendments
We feel this is quite unnecessary
The report is perfectly acceptable and also contains certain criticisms of how the House operates
Mr President , I would briefly like to say that I also oppose the request to refer this back to committee
I understand the procedural considerations raised by Mr Kellett-Bowman , but I do not consider that there are any fundamental , substantive reasons to do so
Indeed , the report was discussed at length and in depth in the committee some months ago
The vote was practically unanimous
Only yesterday a normal debate took place and today it has been the subject of only one amendment
by the committee itself
Therefore , I do not think that there is any justification for postponing this report , which obviously affects the normal functioning of the institutions involved
Consequently , I think we should vote to proceed with the discussion and vote on this report
following detailed consideration of them by our services , and not just because of the naming of a specific person
To prevent any misunderstanding , therefore , they were not ruled inadmissible simply because they referred by name to a former official
We shall now vote on the request for referral back to committee
(Parliament rejected the request for referral back to committee)
(In successive votes , Parliament adopted the two decisions and the resolution)
This Council regulation offers an excellent illustration of the complexity of the CAP compensation system
In order to follow it , we need to go back to 1984
Community legislation passed at the time took no account of the special situation of producers who had neither supplied nor sold milk during the reference year
These farmers were in fact taking part in a conversion programme introduced under a 1977 Council regulation and had agreed to refrain from selling their produce
Over the years , case after case has gone to the European Court of Justice , and many a regulation has been adopted in an attempt to remedy the situation
they have filled in the wrong coloured form
These examples demonstrate how creaky the whole system of subsidies has become
We clearly need to reform the whole CAP
Linkohr report (A4-0350/98)
progress by both parties to the agreement
The very considerable tasks that remain to be accomplished in such fields as biotechnology cannot be tackled in isolation from country to country or from continent to continent
investigators and by scientific institutions working together
It is thus a cause for great satisfaction that Parliament and its rapporteur , Rolf Linkohr , recommend rapid implementation of the EU/USA Agreement
Le Rachinel recommendation (A4-0349/98)
I am pleased to see that this procedure aimed at harmonising the distinguishing signs to be attached to motor vehicles is to succeed
internal and external borders every year
At the same time , the general implementation of the 'Community' identification will contribute to developing the common sense of belonging for the 375 million citizens of the European Union
citizens beyond our borders
That is also something we should welcome
However , I do have one regret: the proposal for a regulation leaves it to the Member States to choose between 'national' plates and 'Community' plates
Although such latitude might be an application of the principle of subsidiarity , I would have preferred a slightly greater element of compulsion
Watts report (A4-0310/98)
The objective of the proposal is excellent and I support the aims:
(1) Effect a greater harmonisation of international ferry safety provisions on services within the EU
(2) Ensure effective application of these provisions
(3) Ensure transparency of operating conditions for regular ferry services (including high-speed vessels) within the EU , whatever the flag they are flying
I also support the specific proposals of the Commission:
and craft to other regular services
codes into EC law and harmonising minimum specifications for passenger vessels
Scottish waters are amongst the roughest in the Community yet for much of the island population there is no viable alternative
Ferry safety is thus of paramount importance
The report and proposal deserve approval
Following a number of high profile shipping disasters in recent years we must do everything possible to avoid any more 'Titanics'
Among the large number of Commission initiatives on common rules within the EU for safety at sea , this proposed directive is both necessary and particularly relevant
The growing interest in scheduled sailings within the Community among companies operating ferries under third country flags imposes the need for uniform safety rules applicable to all
I am therefore happy to give the report my support
and high speed passenger craft services in the Community
Unfortunately , this hearing did not arouse a great deal of interest among our colleagues
They were mistaken
In fact , the hearing that was held on this proposal for a directive brought to light safety problems that really give us food for thought
We must therefore thank our friend Francis Watts for having taken the initiative to request and organise this hearing
More than one of the experts who attended highlighted an unbelievable lack of safety , despite the fact that IMO regulations already provide for a wide range of safety measures
During the hearing , German experts showed us image after image to support this
in good condition
every year on these boats
However , it is not the role of a Member to make the public aware of the problems that might affect people's safety or that of their families
ships operating to or from ports of Member States of the Community
I truly believe that he was right to table amendments that go further than the Commission's proposals
European institutions and transport companies to do everything in their power to improve safety on these boats , which are unavoidable for many travellers
tonnage of 970 000 tonnes , does not have any ships or high speed vessels carrying passengers on its register
For if that were the case , my conscience would not be as clear as it is now
For all these reasons , I voted in favour of the report by Mr Watts and I hope that the shipowners will take this warning from the European Parliament seriously
I am backing this report and my Labour colleague Mr Watts' call for the setting out of standards for safe operation of the many ferries using EU waters
Like many British people I recall the tragic loss of life in the Herald of Free Enterprise ferry disaster at Zeebrugge
As always the rescue services did a courageous job of trying to save as many people as they could
However we should not put ourselves as travelling members of the public or our emergency services in this kind of situation in the first place
passengers of the best safety standards on board if people are to continue to use ferries in their journeys around the EU
I hope that the industry will cooperate fully with our governments and the EU to make further strides towards the highest possible safety standards
Teverson report (A4-0331/98)
consensus regarding a possible control system that is more reliable , transparent and efficient
POP commitments
establishment of comparable sanctions
Meanwhile , a lack of clarity exists in the attempt to make the Member States responsible for monitoring vessels in non-Community waters , particularly in waters which are subject to international conventions
There are no plans to allocate additional funds and operational problems could occur
Ambiguities also remain to be clarified regarding responsibilities in and the scope of monitoring for vessels of third countries
and vessel owners
only on pre-arranged inspections
Likewise , prior permission should be sought for on-line access to data bases
Imbalances therefore remain , even in the Commission proposal , despite the amendments made by this report
We will therefore abstain in the vote
We only hope that it will be possible to achieve consensus in the Council
The development of the fishing industry in recent years has necessitated the modernisation of control systems
That is both logical and correct
Unfortunately , the Commission proposal must also be seen in the context of poor cooperation between the Member States in the monitoring of fisheries
It is reasonable for the Commission to want a reinforcement of controls after the landing of catches
This initiative is also necessary in the interests of restoring confidence in the EU's control systems
Increased monitoring of fishing vessels from third countries too is a worthwhile and necessary initiative
B√∂sch report (A4-0297/98)
fraud
The Court of Auditors' conclusions are overwhelming but they are not new
The Committee on Budgetary Control had made similar statements on many occasions , but they never really received any reaction
an efficient and consistent prosecution system at European Union level
The Commission's policy in cases of corruption within its own ranks is still unclear and inconsistent; there is , therefore , a tendency to cover up such cases wherever possible
We approve of this assessment: in reading it , all the facts are clearly stated
for combating fraud on behalf of all the institutions , as well as the technical elements proposed to ensure the necessary independence of this new body
European Parliament , and we regret , too , that the need for a European Public Prosecutor has not been reiterated
that the only solution was to create a new integrated Community body , a European Public Prosecutor
remit
The B√∂sch report goes more or less in this direction , which is why we voted in favour of it
Mr President , I would like to present an explanation of vote on behalf of the Liberal Group
I think it important to note that a concrete step has now been taken in determining how the fraud investigation unit , UCLAF , can be strengthened
Parliament has once again taken the initiative and put forward a concrete proposal
So now it is up to the Commission to react to that proposal and draw up measures to strengthen UCLAF
It may well be that the model presented is not complete , and it may well be that a few things need to be changed
We in the Liberal Group have had discussions , as have others , on what the absolutely correct model should be
Opinions differed as to how the structure that is absolutely right should be achieved; these differences were also reflected in the voting
corruption
time , which would not do at all
It is vital that the system be strengthened now , so that we are better able to combat corruption and fraud
We would begin by thanking the rapporteur for a thorough text , which reflects both his competence and his commitment
for out of Community funds
Confidence in the Commission has now been undermined and criticism of its ability to handle taxpayers' money is justified
The statement in the report that this might well be just the tip of the iceberg brings home the gravity of the situation
It is therefore incumbent upon the Commission to crack down on irregularities , whilst at the same time ensuring that legal and political responsibility is taken for any wrongdoing
prevent the occurrence of further irregularities
We should not underestimate our position or our strength when it comes to fighting fraud and pressing the Commission to take measures
transparency
We do not feel that the proposal for establishing a new structure called OLAF is necessarily the right way to combat irregularities in the handling of Community funds
There is no basis in the Treaties for such an entity , which would not be subject to democratic oversight and could justifiably be criticised on that count
A greater degree of scrutiny must be exercised in this area , and this can best be achieved through a combination of measures
Several of the amendments put down suggest some interesting options in this respect
Given the severity of the situation , the proposal discussed in Mr B√∂sch's report should not , however , be totally thrown overboard
We should be using the leverage it gives us to persuade the Commission to come forward with further suggestions
The steps it is already undertaking are welcome and necessary , but still more action will be required
The European Parliament will have a significant role to play , and the proposals in the B√∂sch report provide us with a good negotiating position vis-√†-vis the Commission
overwhelming conclusions
be needed for effective financial control
So we see an endless procession of incidents of fraud , waste or administrative irregularities
evidence and they give an appalling image of the construction of Europe
The B√∂sch report proposes granting greater independence to UCLAF by transforming it into OLAF (Anti-Fraud Office)
Why not
This reform will not , however , be enough , for the problems run much deeper
In this respect , I have often had the impression in this debate that the European Parliament was trying to salve its conscience by condemning its own sins in others
bring rain
And , in particular , the 'Euro-worship' that has hitherto surrounded the Commission's actions has created a climate that is scarcely likely to promote efficient financial control
If a third party tries to criticise anything , he is told: 'We are working for Europe; if you criticise us , you are being anti-European'
My group is well placed to know that
the law
Europe can only be regarded as adult when it accepts real external controls , by the Member States in particular
indirectly abetting fraud
been committed by officials of the European Commission
The possibility of such activities shows just how relevant the report is that we are giving our opinion on today
Our rapporteur points out that the effectiveness of the Unit for the Coordination of Fraud Prevention (UCLAF) is restricted by a strict legal and organisational framework that limits its independence
Moreover , its has a staff of only some 30 officials who can work on investigations
It hardly comes as a surprise , therefore , to read that UCLAF has a limited capacity for action at the moment
by European officials in the performance of their duties
available to combat fraud
available
I therefore fully support the report submitted to us
The EU anti-fraud unit , known as UCLAF , has a primary function to protect the financial interests of the European Union
This is an unenviable task , particularly if one reads the recent annual report for 1997 on the fight against fraud in the European Union
According to this report cigarette fraud in the European Union amounted to over ¬£1
28 billion in 1997 alone
duties and VAT within the national territories of the 15 EU Member States
euro currency notes from 1 January 2002
On this date the euro currency will flood the territories of 11 Member States of the EU encompassing a population of over 291 million
The law enforcement agencies of the EU must be extremely well prepared if the counterfeiters of the euro are to be defeated head-on
I support a coordinating role to be given to UCLAF , the EU anti-Fraud Unit , as well as to Europol , the European police agency , to oversee this extremely important counter-intelligence operation
Action must be taken to protect the credibility and authenticity of the euro currency when it is launched and replaces national currencies
the EU law enforcement agencies
There will also be a need for a common definition of currency counterfeiting and arrangements must be put in place to combat it in a concerted and structured manner
organised crime can be tackled effectively at European level
capital operates
However , these provisions can and must be utilised to the maximum so as to ensure that the evil of the prospective counterfeiting of the euro currency will be defeated
The resolution on the independence , role and status of UCLAF aims to strengthen the control of fraud against the Community budget
organisation and functioning
justice area and the setting-up of a public prosecution authority for the EU
In our view , this initiative in principle presupposes that it should be possible to harmonise the criminal law and administration of justice of the individual Member States
The legal formulation of the Member States' criminal justice provisions and criminal law should under no circumstances be a matter for the Union
the EU's own institutions and must not constitute a move towards a European prosecution authority
is being used for
The report also refers to Article 280 of the Treaty of Amsterdam , which opens up new possibilities for the control of fraud on a Community-wide basis
of justice'
We feel it is important to draw attention to this because it specifically states that the EU may not interfere in national policies in this area
by the comments on Article 280 in the report
Clearly the EU cannot assume legislative powers in areas for which provisions have not been ratified by the individual Member States
The fight against fraud and corruption is a key issue for the Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament
Let there be no doubt that combating fraud directed against the financial interests of the EU must always be a top priority
Hence coordination of the fight against fraud - as understood by UCLAF - must always be placed on the best possible footing
The report proposes the setting-up of a new unit to investigate fraud internally in the EU institutions
We do not think that is an optimum solution
It should be possible for this work to be carried out by UCLAF , but it should have a more independent status with respect to the Commission
on European Union'
In practice , this means that Denmark will participate in that cooperation as long as it is intergovernmental
For that reason , the Danish Social Democrats cannot support any moves to set up a common prosecution service or eventually to introduce a common criminal justice system
legal field
The Danish Social Democrats have therefore chosen to abstain from voting on paragraphs K , L and M
the EU system
The Danish Social Democrats have therefore chosen to support the report as a whole
I support the B√∂sch report because his proposals were a possible way forward for UCLAF
In 1980 I proposed that the Community should have a flying squad
So I was delighted when UCLAF was set up at this Parliament's initiative
Parliament has over the years added resources for the unit's work
However , we discovered that UCLAF's investigations were inhibited when working within the Commission itself
Mr B√∂sch's proposal for an independent OLAF offers the answer to this problem
All institutions can be looked at including this Parliament , which I welcome
Mr Santer's reply was helpful and constructive
The House wisely , in my view , resisted attempts via amendments to emasculate this proposal
I congratulate Mr B√∂sch
Vigorous measures are required to fight fraud and corruption
There is a problem within the EU itself and there are irregularities involving Community funds going on inside and outside the Union
The latest allegations corroborate this , as does the report from the Court of Auditors
The report calls for the setting-up of a separate body - OLAF - with extended powers and increased resources
This would be one way of ensuring that the necessary internal inquiries are carried out
If OLAF is to be truly independent , the Commission cannot be allowed to act as the appointing authority
It must not take the decisions on nominations , or be responsible for instigating disciplinary measures
A European criminal law area is not what is required , and OLAF should not be given the functions of a public prosecutor's office
This whole debate on fraud , corruption and vanishing funds is evidence that all is not well with the EU
It is too big , too cumbersome to grasp and virtually impossible to oversee
The single most effective way of fighting fraud , irregularities and corruption is to introduce Nordic-style openness and transparency , with guaranteed protection for those who provide information
detection rate would increase and our problems become fewer
The Commission is living in an ivory tower
per se as a sign of mistrust
head , at least in those areas where criticisms are being voiced and Parliament wishes to exercise its rights to carry out checks
Then , everything is suddenly classified secret , reserved , internal and confidential
But I ask you , Mr Santer: what is there in an internal report on financial control that needs to be kept secret from Parliament
Why should we not be told speedily and plainly where overspending has occurred
Who has anything to hide from us here
The culture of mistrust within your Commission has even undermined the rights assigned to us by the Treaty
Article 206 provides that the Commission shall submit any information necessary for the discharge to Parliament
appropriations for humanitarian aid
It is a shame that this is the only language you appear to understand
Yes , we do not simply have a problem , but a serious crisis in relations between the Commission and Parliament
in good management
In Germany , the people have just decided what happens to those who only want to sit out crises
should be aware that we will have to refuse to grant it a discharge in December
in particular - because of the immense damage it does to the EU's image in the eyes of the public
The Commission's central service for the fight against fraud , UCLAF , is therefore an EU body of exceptional importance to the Union as a whole
more difficult
And there is currently no prospect of any significant progress
against fraud involving the EU's financial interests
I wholeheartedly support this initiative
I can support most of this report , but I do not agree that our goal should be to create a European criminal law area and establish a European judicial authority
Nor do I wish to see Europol given new powers
That is why I did not vote in favour of the report
Our group supported the B√∂sch report mainly because it avoids political cant and provides a rigorous analysis of the internal corruption in the Commission
The rapporteur does not try to hide the extent of the fraud and corruption within the Commission's services
substantial sums
And yet , the rapporteur states that 'these reported cases probably represent no more than the tip of the iceberg'
It is therefore totally unacceptable to hear the President of the Commission , Mr Santer , describing these extremely serious practices , with black humour , as 'administrative acrobatics'
omerta , of irresponsibility and of impunity
It is a world of forged contracts , of invented reports , of missing documents and of dubious reports associated with certain firms of privileged consultants
authorities in exceptional cases
cover up the truth'
A regional newspaper this morning summed up yesterday's debate with the headline: 'Disciplinary measures unlikely for widespread scandals'
This anti-fraud unit , one of the many cogs in the Commission's machine , lacks independence
It thus tends to protect officials systematically
The proposals by Mr B√∂sch to strengthen this unit and to grant it as much independence as possible are therefore heading in the right direction
its financial activities
Commission dealt with the BSE issue
correctly
To limit the volume of uncontrolled appropriations , we must reduce as far as possible the proportion of funds that has to pass through Brussels
The most effective controls are those that are carried out at the levels closest to the taxpayers
in the comitology system , with its many committees and other consultative bodies
Decisions are taken here that sometimes have considerable financial implications
view of the dossier and the state of progress of the procedure
Under these conditions , interest groups can quite easily exert an influence and win their case
This excellent analysis shows that the excessive concentration of powers and the bureaucratic labyrinth which this creates represent a very significant source of fraud and corruption
Once again , the correct response here is that of genuine subsidiarity
But , unfortunately , the Treaty of Amsterdam proposes going in the opposite direction
The best way of combating fraud and corruption within the Commission is to enshrine the principle of full openness and transparency
Fraud will be uncovered much more effectively if the public and investigative journalists alike have access to Commission records
The current system , which shrouds in secrecy what happens to taxpayers' money , is not acceptable
If things continue as they are , the logical consequence will be that the Commission have to cease its activities in those areas where major problems have arisen
Sis√≥ Cruellas report (A4-0241/98)
A European transport network offers enormous advantages in very different areas
It is vital that we promote this development , particularly in view of the fact that the infrastructure is not interoperable
The rapporteur makes some extremely important points about this
We are very much in favour of developing a sustainable transport network and exploiting technological possibilities , and we were therefore happy to support the report
States and neighbouring countries
If this has to come from the public sector it will mean a heavy burden on the national budgets , so private capital will be needed
We need to develop a climate in the Union which makes investment in such projects attractive for the private sector
best possible benefits for society
To sum up , we must use the knowledge and funding available carefully to produce a sustainable and sound transport network , and this report provides a very useful starting-point
between the EU and Eastern Europe
has put on the Eastern European countries in association with demands for certain investment in infrastructure
This criticism is not to deny that there is a need for massive investment in the infrastructure of Eastern Europe
On the other hand , the EU's transport policy does call for some criticism in principle
EU have in opening up Eastern and Central European markets for their products by improving east-west communications
The question is just what significance this massive input of capital will have for Eastern European trade and industry
peripheral regions
the peripheral regions
when it comes to publicising the environmental assessments it claims to carry out before lending money for a range of infrastructure programmes in Eastern Europe
For these reasons we cannot vote in favour of the Sis√≥ Cruellas report
on grounds of national interest
It was only during the 1980s that a debate was opened on a genuinely pan-European transport policy
Helsinki
These were a great success
For the first time , elected representatives of the people of western and eastern Europe could discuss and adopt political resolutions on transport problems together
Today , we are presented with a new proposal from the Commission on connecting our infrastructure network with that of our neighbours in eastern Europe
in Vienna
position
is currently being completed , but without the rail shuttle and the rapid road link required by the Commission , the EIB and the European Parliament
But how are the other projects getting on
It would seem that large sums have been spent on studies and on various plans , but for the rest , there has been complete silence
400 billion over the next 15 years and that the most urgent measures to be taken by the year 2000 already required around ECU 220 billion
I am now waiting to see some concrete results
I know that up until now major national infrastructures have been financed to a large extent by public money
National investment could have been greater still if all the taxes and duties on transport had been used for investment in infrastructure , but that has not been the case
Indeed , we are all aware that , in order to build the trans-European networks , we need enormous financial resources , financial resources that the Member States cannot supply in the short term
We must therefore find other sources of funding
We assume that the European Investment Bank will certainly do all in its power to finance and promote at least some of the various cases
Equally , we hope that financial resources from the different Structural Funds will be made available at last to begin to build infrastructure networks and , consequently , to create jobs
However , in spite of all this , I do not believe that we will have sufficient financial resources to pay for the 14 main priority projects
In my opinion , we must try to do everything to ensure that private capital also goes into the projects
Without it , the programmes might have to continue for decades , if not forever , in order to satisfy all our hopes and needs
Do we need to think about introducing a general European toll if the funding cannot be found from conventional sources
must find other possibilities of cofunding for certain infrastructure projects
I am saying all this because we are faced with considerable problems in terms of making progress with the construction of Europe
But the problems are surmountable , if nothing unforeseen occurs
However , in my opinion , the unforeseen is already on our doorstep
The first estimates by the TINA group indicate that additional expenditure in the region of ECU 45 billion to ECU 150 billion is required
Where are we going to find this extra money
to rail transport , 25 % to road transport and 15 % to combined transport
These are questions that are not answered in the report by Mr Joaquim Sis√≥ Cruellas
fast speed
For all these reasons , I voted against the report by Mr Sis√≥ Cruellas
Baldarelli report (A4-0246/98)
The continuous increase in the various forms of road traffic calls for integrated management of this traffic at all levels: local , regional , national and European
The constant progress in information technology allows us to give serious consideration to such a hypothesis from now on
That is why the Commission communication and the report we are voting on today are of such interest
all road users , particularly in terms of safety and time-saving
The possible economic and financial advantages are equally obvious: improved traffic management in terms of time and space , multimodal transport , etcetera

Novo Belenguer report (A4-0247/98)
We congratulate Mr Novo on his report , which deals thoroughly and in detail with what is such an important field
I regret , and I shall continue to say so , that the minimal reference to tourism was lost from the Treaty of Amsterdam
the chosen holiday destination
It was for that reason that I also proposed the creation of a European Agency for Tourism
and certain other Members , we believed that tourism is much more than statistics
We felt that , in the long term , the loss of this reference from the revised Treaty would result in more problems than benefits , even for the tourist sector itself
legal vacuum somehow , although unfortunately outside the Treaty of Amsterdam
I am pleased that the European Parliament is discussing a report relating to European Union measures for the tourism industry
This is very important from an Irish perspective considering the tourism industry plays a very considerable role in generating jobs in the Irish economy
been created in Ireland during the present Community Support Framework programme 1994-1999
The present tourism operational programme accounts for 369 million pounds , which is over 8 % of the overall Structural Fund programme presently spent in Ireland
I am confident that the Irish tourism industry will develop and prosper over the next few years
The introduction of a European single currency should have a positive effect in this regard
the cost of holidays should reduce even further
A single European currency brings with it a frontier-free capital zone where 'bureaux de change' no longer exist and costs are reduced
over the next few years
The Irish Government has a role to play so as to guarantee that the Irish tourism industry develops to its maximum potential
Discussions will take place shortly between the Irish Government and the European Commission relating to the next share-out of EU Structural Funds for the period 2000-2006
The Irish Government will have to formulate a National Development Plan outlining our social and economic investment priorities for the seven-year period post-1999
substantial provisions must be included in the National Development Plan concerning future EU and national funding for the tourism industry in Ireland
The Danish Social Democrats today voted against the Novo Belenguer report on Community measures affecting tourism
We do not think that the Community should start harmonising the Member States' tourism policies , as is advocated in this report
It must be up to the individual countries to draw up sensible policies of their own in conformity with the subsidiarity principle
There is thus no need for a directorate for tourism in the Commission , and there is also no need to appropriate more funds for this sector
The Novo Belenguer report sounds too much like a plea for an EU tourism policy
We think it would be difficult , if not impossible , to promote 15 countries of such diversity in one and the same campaign
to the Member States and their national and regional tourist boards
things by setting up a directorate for tourism , entirely misses the mark
The Commission report on Community actions with an impact on tourism carried out in 95/96 clearly demonstrate two essential aspects
million jobs)
which shows just how unrealistic some attempts have been to communitise policy in the sector
action and , simultaneously , to enhance synergies with other Community and/or national policies (planning , environment , culture , arts and crafts , heritage , employment policies , structural actions , new technologies)
This is a positive report and I would like to emphasise one aspect which we consider to be essential
It is not enough merely to state that the tourism sector is of fundamental importance where employment is concerned
It is essential also to guarantee the quality of that employment
of stable jobs , minimising the effects of seasonal fluctuations and ensuring that competitiveness is not achieved at the cost of low wages
XXIII and developing a common tourism policy at EU level
The result would simply be more bureaucracy and piles of documents
As far as the tourism sector is concerned , I do not honestly believe that any major benefit would be felt out there in the real world
Miranda report (A4-0289/98)
the officials
Not everyone agreed with me but I still believe that
This House is well served by many officials and I salute them for it
However , in this case I want to say that there are many cases which reveal gross incompetence over many years which was rife in DG VI (Administration)
That prolonged litany of negligences and errors has damaged the image of this institution
The former Director-General for Administration Jean Feidt should carry responsibility for that deplorable situation
I could list them if there was more time - this House has been let down by poor administration in DG VI and Mr Jean Feidt should carry that responsibility
Our group voted against the Miranda report because of its key element , that is , the discharge given to the section on the European Parliament for the 1996 financial year
Legal Service and the Financial Controller
time , the non-automatic carry-over procedure be followed
Nonetheless , this suggestion was not taken up by the administration
It was not until the end of January 1997 that the administration learnt that the additional agreement had never actually been signed by the President
The former President of Parliament was then asked to sign it retrospectively , more than a month after the deadline , which he obviously refused to do
This did not prevent the Secretary-General from putting the same request , once more in vain , to his successor
There is an even more astonishing fact
According to financial statements that were circulating between the services of the authorizing officer and the Financial Controller , the ECU 30
76 million involved did , however , form part of the appropriations automatically carried over to the 1997 financial year
Moreover , this sum was also marked as legitimately carried over in a document dated 20 January 1997 and signed by the appropriate authorizing officer
of the European Parliament to sign the retrospective additional agreement
The Secretary-General was perfectly aware of this
closing accounts: despite the absence of the President of Parliament's signature to the additional agreement , this procedure allowed ECU 30
76 million to remain in the list of appropriations actually carried over to the 1997 financial year
in question
to ensure that Parliament's budget is able to finance the D3 purchase within the allotted time
However , Parliament's administration did not submit the additional agreement to the President for his signature , nor did it then resort to the non-automatic carry-over procedure
Moreover , it tried to backdate the additional agreement and , finally , took for granted that the appropriations would be carried over to the 1997 financial year
In this way , Parliament's administration completely failed in its responsibility to actually carry over the ECU 30
76 million in accordance with the financial regulations
It is this unbelievable series of breaches and failings that we should have penalised today by refusing the discharge , in order to avoid this happening again
In addition , my group is pleased with the decision not to give discharge to the Economic and Social Committee
the Committee of the Regions and the absence of a consistent staffing policy , did not choose to do the same for that institution
Yet certain irregularities in the running of the Committee of the Regions were brought to light in the Court of Auditors' annual report for the 1996 financial year
I voted in favour of the 1996 discharge report by Mr Miranda on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control
It is quite right that we should be postponing discharge for the Economic and Social Committee , since serious shortcomings and irregularities have come to light
These must be investigated internally by the EU's Court of Auditors and UCLAF and , if necessary , externally by the competent national authorities
Discharge cannot be granted until this has been done
I personally think that there are problems too within the European Parliament and I would cite , among other things , procedures governing tendering and the use of consultants
There also seem to be shortages of qualified staff in the accounting and legal services
The difficulties in the Parliament appear , however , to be structural in nature
Unlike the ESC , Parliament has not given any cause to suspect fraud
I therefore suggest that we ask the Court of Auditors to look more closely at the problems
Work has already begun in the European Parliament , but some assistance from 'outside' would be useful in my view

Own resources (budget procedure)
The next item is the Commission statement on own resources and the budget procedure
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission has just adopted its report on the operation of the own resources system
presented
Article 10 of the own resources decision states that the text should be presented in 1999
We have decided to do so earlier for one simple reason: the financing system for the Union budget is a vital factor in the negotiations on Agenda 2000
Without this report , we could not possibly conclude these negotiations , as agreed , in March 1999
Now that we have all the aspects of the problem before us , I would appeal for Agenda 2000 to be tackled with renewed determination
The report the Commission has adopted today is comprehensive , transparent , objective and open
It is comprehensive in exploring all conceivable avenues for a fair but also adequate future financing system for the Union
It is transparent in hiding neither the difficulties nor the advantages of each potential choice
It is objective in that it is based on indisputable figures
And it is open as , for the time being , it puts forward only options
With this report the Commission hopes to take some of the passion out of what will be a difficult and politically delicate debate and give it an objective basis
In a new departure , the Commission is openly tackling the issue of net balances
This is , I feel , essential as I would like the inevitable discussion on this subject to be based on clear and objective figures
But I would add that it is a concept that must be handled with caution , as our report clearly shows
Mr President , after these introductory remarks , I would like to present the broad lines of our document
It is presented in two parts
The first deals with the operation of the present system and possible future developments
The second addresses the issue of budgetary imbalances
The development of the present system in recent years reflects the changes introduced by the 1988 and 1994 decisions on own resources
Contributions have become fairer as they are now a more accurate reflection of Member States' ability to pay , as expressed by their gross national product
What is more , the existing arrangements have provided the Union with adequate resources to finance expenditure without the financial crises that the Union has experienced in the past
In some respects , however , the present system has its shortcomings , one of which has been repeatedly underlined by the European Parliament itself
Financial autonomy , which is fundamental to the very concept of own resources , has gradually been lost as the proportion of the Union's budget financed by national contributions has grown
resource which , with the capping of the base , now amounts to little more than a national contribution based on gross national product
The present system also encounters management difficulties connected with the collection of customs duties and agricultural duties , which we know as traditional own resources
If we are to move towards a more transparent and logical system , we have two radically different options available
The first possibility would be to simplify the present system
This could be done by enhancing the role of the GNP resource in the system of contributions , even though this runs counter to the very concept of own resources
A bigger role for gross national product would no doubt make the present system simpler and fairer , but it would not give the Union greater financial autonomy
in the system of contributions
But this proposal raises problems
For instance , the solidarity objective is currently pursued by the expenditure side of the Union budget
This approach guarantees more effective convergence efforts than a simple budgetary transfer to the less prosperous countries
A second option would be to introduce one or more new own resources , in order to broaden the tax base of the own resources system
This is something that Parliament has advocated on many occasions
the eyes of the public
Our report contains a long list of proposed or suggested resources
very few options that satisfy all the criteria
Only actual VAT , as proposed by the European Parliament in 1994 , would appear to be a viable option for the medium term
I will now turn to the sensitive issue of budgetary imbalances
Let me begin by repeating - as the Commission has always said - that the very concept of budgetary balance is difficult to grasp and to handle
The costs and benefits of belonging to the European Union cannot be reduced to a simple arithmetical calculation
But Germany , the Netherlands , Austria and Sweden have referred to the Fontainebleau compromise , which stated: 'Expenditure policy is ultimately the essential means of resolving the question of budgetary imbalances
appropriate time
'
magnitude , or even bigger , than that of the United Kingdom before correction
relative prosperity
The special situation it was in at the start of the 1980s is now becoming rather commonplace
negative , effects on these
common agricultural policy and the Structural Funds
Despite its reservations on the very concept of net balances , the Commission has not shied away from the issue
It has considered a number of options which may allay the concerns expressed
I would , however , like to put them in context
Firstly , the source of budgetary imbalances is to be found on the expenditure side of the budget , as was recognised at Fontainebleau
Secondly , if there had not been a serious effort to contain Union expenditure - in which you played your part - the imbalances would have become more pronounced
Finally , the cost of enlargement has to be shared out fairly by reference to the ability of all the present Member States to contribute
exclusive
A first option would consist of a return to a unified and simplified financing system
There could be a simplification of the financing system in favour of a mechanism based more , or even entirely , on the gross national product resource
This simplification could include the gradual elimination of the existing correction mechanism
Secondly , it would be possible to make a correction on the expenditure side
As I have already said , the Fontainebleau agreement underscores the role that Community expenditure should play in the correction of budgetary imbalances
the economic and social cohesion of the least prosperous Member States
The other major component of budget expenditure is the common agricultural policy , which is not intended as a means of redistributing wealth between Member States
Since the common agricultural policy is the source of certain budgetary imbalances , the possibility of reducing the Community contribution to direct aid for farmers could be considered
This would clearly not amount to renationalising the common agricultural policy as farmers' rights will remain unchanged and decisions will continue to be taken in Brussels
A third option would be to introduce a generalised correction mechanism
This mechanism would apply for all the Member States meeting the necessary conditions
negative budgetary balances above a certain threshold
the table for the final stage of the negotiations on Agenda 2000
Having said that , the Commission continues to believe that the discussion on budgetary balances must not overshadow our reflection on an effective and fair financing system
On this score I would once again stress that in its report the Commission presents various options but does not express any preference for one or the other
Finally , whether we like it or not , we must allow for the differences , in terms of decision-making procedures , between Union expenditure and the financing system
I would remind you in this connection that , in the Commission's view , Agenda 2000 can be applied without any financial resources in excess of the current own resources ceiling
It will not therefore require any urgent amendment of the own resources decision , a process which we all know is highly complex and cumbersome from the institutional angle
the necessary decisions with a clear and calm mind
Mr President , Mr Santer , thank you for the Commission report
Long awaited , much longed-for
You did say that you had drawn up the report dispassionately
I would have liked to have seen some passion , because then we would perhaps have had a decision on the table which it was worth discussing
Instead , we have a whole array of options , admittedly with certain qualifications , but nothing more than that
Be that as it may , we have also had a focused discussion in Parliament and have already reached one or two conclusions in the Committee on Budgets
We take as our starting-point the fact that we are bound by rules in the Treaties
between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least-favoured regions
That is the first point
their relative contributions to the EU budget
If we look closely , we note that this is actually true for all Member States except the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom generates 15
9 % of Community GNP , but only contributes 9
9 % of the budget
You described why this is the case , namely because of what is known as the British rebate
Nevertheless , although contributions to the budget are indeed more or less based on performance , Member States are still demanding reduced contributions
We have already had counter-proposals for a progressive system of raising revenue , or increasing the budget above the present ceiling of 1
27 % of GNP
All of this was reflected in the minutes of the Cardiff summit
The Member States calling , more or less vociferously , for their contributions to be cut , base their arguments on the so-called concept of net contributors
They have made comments on this , and so their equivalence-oriented approach - which , as a method , stands on extremely shaky ground - requires no further comments from me
One thing is clear , however; on closer inspection , it becomes apparent that , all the same , there are definite imbalances between the wealthier Member States
For , example , it is immediately noticeable that Denmark , with the second most powerful economy in the Community , receives considerably more from the budget than it puts in
budget that they receive
But if , as I have just said , the cause for these imbalances is not on the revenue side , then it must inevitably be on the expenditure side
And here , I believe that our discussions and also our lines of argument in the Committee on Budgets were more focused than those proposed in your report
We note , namely , that Member States' participation in the common policies varies considerably
This uneven distribution is particularly apparent in the common agricultural policy
performance - than Member States with a smaller farming sector
Sweden and Germany's proportional contribution to the Community budget is thus twice as large as their proportional participation in the agricultural policy
But because 45 % of the budget is spent on the agricultural policy , it is obvious that this is where the source of the imbalances lies
We are , therefore , rather pleased that you also examined this , our approach towards reducing the imbalances , in your report , which is for agricultural policy to be cofinanced
promote stewardship of the countryside and the protection of the environment
This trend should be further reinforced by Agenda 2000
Already , between 50 % and 60 % of agricultural expenditure is of a structural nature
structural policies
This would not , therefore , amount to a break with the system , another point you mentioned
That is why this scheme for national cofinancing of the agricultural policy is being proposed
It would not only be a logical development , but would also go a considerable way towards alleviating the problem of net contributions
propel the common agricultural policy forward , but it has one additional , indisputable advantage over all the other options you mentioned , namely that it will be possible to implement
It does not require unanimity in the Council: only a qualified majority
least 2
5 % a year , the current ceiling of 1
27 % of own resources will not suffice to enable us simultaneously to extend Community policies , maintain the cohesion policy and finance enlargement to the East
are firmly of the opinion that any financing system which does not encompass fiscal progressivity and relative prosperity as basic principles is unfair and divisive from the start
the political decision to recommend a redistribution of expenditure to compensate for the net balances , instead of recommending a redistribution of income based on fiscal progressivity
It has to be said that the proposal the Commission has put before us will not solve anything
It will not produce a single euro more for the Community's budget , and will result in the Commission being starved of funds and unable to operate effectively
Secondly , however you look at it , the proposal the Commission has put before us is regressive , regardless of which alternative is eventually chosen
The proposal is also counter to financial solidarity and cohesion , and it is unfair , as the committees involved in the parliamentary procedures will tell you , along with the European farmers
common interest , as I imagine this Parliament will tell you
Mr President , we have no doubt as to the importance of a detailed debate on the system of Community own resources and we will analyse this document with particular attention
However , certain points must first be clarified
Financial matters cannot be divorced from their corresponding economic context
This is also true if we wish to base our thinking on a foundation of redistributive justice and solidarity
A balance must be achieved , both from the revenue side and from the expenditure side
on the extremely restricted basis , as we know , of 1
27 %
that have already been caused by the current system , those which are anticipated and others of which we are aware
It is very difficult to operate on the current basis
However , the Commission is distorting the discussion to some extent in that , before it has even begun , it has already opted for one of the two courses it suggests
This is because its main concern would appear to be to settle not the problem of own resources , but that of existing imbalances
concept of the Community and the end of the principle of solidarity; it does not believe , as we have seen , in the possibility of a progressive system founded on GNP
It is left with a single option which does not involve own resources but seeks to resolve the problem by reducing spending
That is what the Commission has brought us , which is to say nothing at all , because this debate contributes nothing new
Mr President , Commissioner , I am glad that the Commission is considering the option of cofinancing agricultural policy
Cofinancing agricultural policy is , I believe , the right way forward
This proposal attacks the nub of the problem , because it takes the expenditure side of the budget as its starting-point
decision on own resources
The discussion on net contributors , led by the former Minister of Finance , Mr Waigel , can thus confidently be consigned to history , along with the Finance Minister
2 400 million
The United Kingdom would also stand to benefit considerably from a reform of this kind , to the tune of around DEM 2 000 million
The British rebate would thus be rendered obsolete
If some of the financial burden were transferred from the Union to the Member States , then the EU budget would also have to be reduced by the same amount
of their own pockets
In my opinion , there should be no question of using the resources released to fund trans-European networks and research policy , as a kind of European employment programme
Responsibility for large-scale employment policy must continue to lie with the Member States; it is not possible to fund this at European level
Mr President , Commissioner , thank you very much for your presentation
this debate and what is not
We agree with Mrs M√ºller that the rebate proposed by Mr Waigel was , from the very moment the idea was conceived , unrealistic
in dreamland
That is why it is good that this file has been closed
out even more in the future , and that the current injustice can be stretched even further
That is also nonsense; these are just initial negotiating positions for next March
is not a savings bank into which everyone pays their contributions and then receives them back with as much interest as possible
We are , as Mrs Haug said , a Community committed to solidarity , and the system of own resources also has to be capable of bearing out this claim
On the other hand , it has to be said that the system is unfair , and this is made unusually clear and easy to understand here
as a net contributor looks quite different from that repeatedly claimed by the Dutch Government
In that respect too , these figures are very helpful
have to keep quiet
I agree with you that they should be more accommodating , when they are taking over premises in Luxembourg and expecting us to continue paying for them
(Applause)
they should keep quiet , because there we are a kind of living structural fund
Member States in the Community
and a country such as Sweden to be a net contributor
Something must be wrong with the system there
Where does the fault lie
Precisely where one of the three options makes it clear that it lies: with agriculture
It lies with the repayments
47 % of expenditure goes on agricultural policy
A country with a large farming sector receives more money back and is thus a net beneficiary
The amount the Danes pay in is not unfair , but our spending policies give them more back , with the result that they are net beneficiaries
the case of the Structural Funds , research appropriations and indeed appropriations in general - is a step in the right direction
It has - as Mrs Haug said - the great disadvantage of only needing a qualified majority to become a reality
That will put those wishing to retreat to a veto in a very bad position
A second issue must be addressed , namely the British rebate
sector , 71 %
It came into force then because at that time the repayments the British were receiving from the agriculture sector were around 8 to 10 %
since 1984 , for example regional and structural policy
to explain why the British , who are calling for enlargement at the tops of their voices , should receive a further rebate from the other countries
They will find it hard
distinguished itself by not making any radical demands
of the rebate phased out which are not 'agricultural' , namely regional and structural policy and thus solidarity within the Community , and future enlargement to the East
One final sentence
March: united backing for cofinancing on the one hand , and sound , sensible solutions for the British rebate and for reforming agricultural policy on the other
This is the big issue , and I believe that we will find a good solution to it
(Applause)
corrected
Other Member States endorsed this demand , and it is good that the Commission is now proposing this reform and admitting that there is an imbalance
Two points need to be considered for the future: what financial resources does the EU budget have at its disposal , and how much does each Member State contribute
Only on that basis will it be possible to have an honest discussion about the expenditure side , namely Agenda 2000
No one is calling into question the principle of solidarity , as laid down in the European treaties
And yet , the words spoken by the King of Spain this morning are still ringing in my ears
He stated that the EU has changed , and all of us in this House have agreed on several occasions that the EU will continue to change
That is why we should not assume that this system should be able to operate in the future , in the same way as it does now
In some Member States , gross output has increased constantly over the last few years
However , the money going back into these countries has , in principle , remained at the same level
The current system of rebates , applied to one Member State , has lost its raison d'√™tre - you said it yourself: they even accepted a rebate on BSE
Traditional sources of revenue have lost their significance , and contribute more to the general confusion than to transparency
That is why Theo Waigel proposed that each Member State's contribution should be restricted to a specific maximum amount , calculated in terms of Member States' GNP
also in the field of cohesion and structural policy
This is the basis for a larger Union
people seem to have had the same idea
and that the system would remain practicable even in the event of an enlargement
I do not believe this statement , in the Commission's summary , to be justified
Mr President , the question now is who is going to pay for EU enlargement
If the Cohesion Fund is cut , it will be the cohesion countries that will pay
If the Structural Funds are cut , it will be the EU regions scheduled for development that will pay
If the EU funding of agricultural policy is cut , it will be the farmers of the EU countries that will pay
If common agricultural policy funding is shifted into the national budgets of Member States , it will be the taxpayers who will pay
If Germany pays less into the EU budget , the others will pay more for expansion
If Britain is paid a smaller rebate from EU funds , it will be the British taxpayers who will be paying more for expansion
If the customs revenue which the Netherlands calculates as its own share is deducted from its contribution , then it is not such a large net contributor as it claims
As for my own country , Finland , I might point out that , if customs revenues were taken into account in the budget , we too would be net contributors
I thank the Commission for its statement
These matters have to be discussed frankly
We shall not achieve a politically justified enlargement without all the present Member States putting money into future member countries
It is impossible to accept that a country which supports enlargement should not share in the cost of it
On the basis of this statement , we have to begin looking at who is going to pay
Mr President , I am deeply disappointed
I listened carefully to the Commission's presentation and I have to say , quite plainly , that I had hoped for more
What was uppermost in your minds , Commissioners
Europe or the Member States
The Commission has put forward three proposals which , if you look at them carefully , are really four , like the musketeers , and none of them is brilliant
Council and , in particular , of annoying certain members of the European Council
All Member States are equal , but clearly , some Member States are more equal than others in the eyes of the Commission
Political realism or pragmatism should not be mistaken for shirking responsibilities which is what , in my view , the Commission's proposal amounts to
Europe is at a critical stage just now
We have gone beyond Amsterdam
The Treaty is in the process of ratification
We shall be using the euro in a hundred days' time , at least in the financial sector
We are on the threshold of the ambitious project to enlarge the European Union
Yet the standard of debate in Europe is quite simply not up to the challenges it faces
returns which we all condemn loudly but insincerely
years ago now - repealed Article 200 which would have provided for them
Electoral fever is whipped up in national parliaments over something which does not exist either in practice or in legal terms
In addition , we should remember that nobody is in the European Union for budgetary reasons
If anyone were , they would be rather poor
And since we are on the subject of balances , why not talk about other balances
Why not talk about trade
Why not talk about finance
These are far more complex issues than any of the possible interpretations of the budget balance
How can one evaluate the political and economic advantages of belonging to the European Union
In my view , the Commission should have had the political courage to put forward proposals which would facilitate political progress
I do not know if this is a case of short-sightedness or of political cowardice
proposal
There is talk of lack of democracy , but none of the proposals addresses it
They are merely national contributions by another name
We need to produce a European budget which is transparent and can be understood by the citizens
None of the proposals goes in this direction
It is quite unfair that each citizen's contribution to the European budget should br determined by his country of residence , and not by his income or his wealth
In theory , we are all agreed on this principle
Why not propose a European mini-income tax
I am not talking of a heavy tax
throughout the year
That is what the Community budget costs , ECU 240 per citizen
Not everything would be financed through the tax I am suggesting , though
A very simple tax would suffice
Why not separate out the Community share of VAT on bills
One part would be national VAT , and the other European VAT
The European institutions would have to become more transparent and democratically accountable
If the political courage to do so is lacking , we should at least apply the principle of the ability to pay in Europe
been applied in the Member States for more than a century
At the very least , I should like to stress that the Commission is as little inclined to move forward as the Member States themselves
constitute a good discussion document , but are in fact regressive
Mr President , if I am not mistaken , the world economy is heading for recession
challenge of enlargement
Under these circumstances , what would one expect from the European Union and in particular the more powerful countries
One would expect some signs of solidarity and generosity
United Kingdom opposite the Netherlands , representatives of some of the Union's most powerful countries , and what are they interested in
What message are they broadcasting
How we can keep more money in our own pockets than we give to the European Union's budget
I believe this is an unacceptable situation , one which fails to respond either to the climate or to the great challenges facing the European Union
the national budgets with the costs of the agricultural policy , to adopt a serious approach to these challenges instead of publicising the non-existent Santer packages which are on the way
Mr President , I too believe that the virus of net financial positions could spread a lethal disease throughout the European Union
We must all bear in mind the net gains that we have all made from Europe , particularly the strongest among us
Some are now suffering , however , and I do not think that the fear of evoking a lethal virus should lead us to ignore this problem completely
On the contrary , Commissioner , I am convinced that this discussion should have been initiated rather sooner , because it has been smouldering beneath the ashes for too long
The dangers are now becoming clear
unanimous decision
The danger is that this proposal will completely bypass the discussion of CAP reform contained in Agenda 2000
to say: 'Let's throw our hats in the air and start all over again; there's nothing else to be done'
The risk then is that decisions on the CAP will be postponed for even longer , whereas in my opinion they are more urgent than ever
The imbalances in the CAP have not been invented today , but have existed for a good while
They were not ordered by the doctor , but are the fruit of political decisions
I remember Commissioner MacSharry , when he proposed the reform in 1992 , saying: 'We must redistribute the effects of the agricultural budget among countries , among producers and among regions'
being achieved
welcome today's discussion
But if the final outcome is to hand money back to the Member States , just to redress the net positions of certain countries , then I have serious objections
Instead , I believe that the whole approach to the CAP should be reviewed
than constantly harping on about the risk of national rebates
the worst possible form of fair returns
That is what we should be discussing
Mr President , it really is true that I always speak in front of Mr Liikanen with the feeling that it is not my turn
we have just heard from the Commission
square the circle
How can you satisfy all the contributors to the European Union budget with a budget such as this
penalising them
Community's agricultural population
When you have a budget of this nature , it is obvious that everyone , or a least a large majority of people , are going to be dissatisfied
what we receive from the Community
The fundamental principle behind both capping budgets and cofinancing agriculture , is: I will give you what you need , as long as you pay for what I give you
Such an approach is obviously unsatisfactory , but the Commission is forced to carry out this exercise
The only real solution is to get out of the contradiction into which the Member States have thrown us , in other words to unblock Community expenditure
the taxpayers in the European Union will not receive full recognition in the Union's budget , but this is something the Member States must do for themselves
Mr President , I just want to say one thing
It is very important that the Commission come forward at this particular time with a communication on resources
As President Santer said , it is the condition for a proper discussion on enlargement
My group's point of view is that it is very important that we fundamentally attack the concept of the juste retour
A juste retour based on net contributions only cannot resolve the problem
Obviously the approach should be to achieve a more equitable solution but that requires a north/south balance and also progressivity in the budgetary contributions from all Member States
That is the approach we will take
It is up to the Member States to take up their responsibility but we would compliment the Commission for taking a position at this time
Probably you were wise to simply sum up various alternatives but it is these alternatives which must now be politically on the table
Mr President , perhaps it is good to remember that this report represents an obligation which was given to the Commission to a large extent already in Edinburgh
The Edinburgh Summit decided that the Commission must , first of all , give a report on the operation of the financing system , on the own-resources system
That is one part of this whole report
Secondly , we are under an obligation to give a report on the British rebate system , which is also a part of this report
Thirdly , the Commission was given an obligation to give a report on the potential new own resources
There is a wide-ranging annex on this subject
I hope we have time to pay attention to that - it is about 30 pages
You received the papers very late
The decision was taken by the Commission just before 12
So take your time , study it all
As to the question of the fair return and transparency , we have two objectives which are not always easy to reconcile
Firstly , we are against the concept of fair return
There is no concept whereby every country should get back what it pays
Of course we are against it
Europe and the European Union generate a lot of added value which is shared by all the countries
You cannot make it just an accounting exercise
That is one side , and that is clear
Secondly , we are in favour of transparency
We cannot play a game of hide-and-seek where the figures are not all out
Now we have released all the figures and also there is a separate annex on that explaining how difficult the question of defining different net positions is
There is no simple solution to that issue; we present them all here
As to the character of the report , I wish to emphasise that we have proposed three options with a great number of variations
Today the Commission decided that the options presented in the report are interchangeable , can be added to and can be spread over time
So if there are new options which are well founded , and get the support of the European people and Member States , discussion is wide open
I shall make just one remark on the elements of some proposals
need to be redressed in the context of our solution
That is clear and , before any other solutions are implemented , this element of certain regressive features must be solved
We cannot do it before we have reasonable consensus to go forward
The Commission has now opened the debate
This has been the first public debate on the matter
I am sure it will continue in the Member States and , in good time , we can draw the conclusion whether it is possible to submit a proposal
This has not been a proposal: this is a presentation of the report and options
The debate is closed
Migrants
The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions:
Parliament , to the Commission , on immigration from the Mediterranean area
fleeing civil war or natural disasters and driven away by violence and oppression
their 'promised land'
It is a human drama , but one which cannot and should not have to be resolved by the Member States most affected by this type of immigration
It is the concern and the responsibility of us all , and this is why , as we have so often said , we need European solutions and a European immigration policy
The Council's 'couldn't-care-less' attitude here stands in stark contrast to the panic that is typical of all the Member States' refugee policies
deal with it because it would conflict with the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees
that their own asylum policies parted company with the Geneva Convention a long time ago
There is now a huge gap between principles and reality
treatment in the way they are detained and expelled
This cannot go on
We need to introduce a single European asylum and immigration policy immediately
just outside Europe's borders so that refugees can then be directly distributed among the Member States
European solution
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , one day the right to choose where to live will be recognised as a fundamental human right
In the meantime , we should like to make a few remarks on the documents under discussion this afternoon
We believe in particular - I myself , like the Green Group - that a motion for a resolution is unacceptable for the following reasons
First of all , migration is not a problem relating to the Mediterranean alone
The Socialist Group's document refers solely to a problem which seems to come exclusively from the south , as if migration cannot come from the east , west or north
The second point concerns Europol
Europol's activities in this sector
Our third point relates to the need to step up the fight against the illegal exploitation of immigrants and against the criminal organisations which exploit the right to migrate
migrants' countries of origin
Finally , I hope that the mystery over the Austrian Presidency's strategy document has been solved
this House
This does not set our minds at rest as regards the Austrian Presidency's intentions in this area
before I go on to make some comments on the question of relations with the Mediterranean countries
There is something I would like to say right at the outset , as there have been a few misunderstandings here
The Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees , and its instruments , should not be considered as in any way irrelevant as a consequence of the Austrian strategy paper
the Geneva Convention
of asylum
strategy paper
the subject
the convention on external borders
This declaration of principles did not exert any lasting influence on the migration and asylum policy of the European Community at the time
The actual declarations of intent were also hardly implemented
Parliament and the Council on immigration and asylum policy
the ground , to identify the key elements for effectively regulating migration and to define a new framework for the Union's action
The main elements were defined by the Commission as measures to stem the tide of immigration , effective supervision of immigration and strengthening the position of legal immigrants
areas
of migration
Perfectly respectable work has been done
But the European Union has not really succeeded in learning any lessons from its experiences of the reality of migration
We believe it is necessary to approach this subject once again now , and that is the reason for the Austrian strategy paper
It will be forwarded to Parliament at the earliest possible moment after a first round in the K4 Group
I should like to say a few words now about the Mediterranean countries
Over the last few years the Council has adopted a series of legal acts on illegal immigration , which also apply to relations with Mediterranean countries
Particular attention was paid to issues associated with the return of illegal immigrants to their homeland and to transit countries
State and a third country and standard clauses that in future are to be included in various agreements
it has adopted in the areas of illegal immigration , repatriation , the illegal employment of third country nationals and cooperation in enforcing deportation orders
The Council knows that the standard EU travel document is being successfully used by some Member States in their relations with third countries
Moreover , the standard clauses for repatriation are presently serving as a basis for negotiations on the Euro-Mediterranean association agreements with Egypt , Lebanon and Syria
Now a final word to Mr Orlando on Europol and the problems he raised
The Council and the Council Presidency are also aware of these problems and solutions are being worked on
As far as development cooperation with the Mediterranean countries is concerned , this is included in the MEDA programme
this regard too
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission shares Parliament's concerns on the influx of migrants from Mediterranean countries trying to enter illegally the territory of the Member States
whole of the European Union
Very often organised crime stands behind this phenomenon
These would-be illegal immigrants are recruited among those who are desperately looking for better conditions of life and they sometimes become victims of the trafficking in human beings
The fight against this shameful crime deserves urgent and specific attention
reference has already been made
That document identified three types of measures: actions addressing the root causes of forced migration , actions to manage migration flows , and actions to integrate legally resident third-country nationals
It is clear that we need a multi-disciplinary approach involving all the relevant actors
Law enforcement actions are essential but not enough
We have to combine coordinated actions in the field of judicial and police cooperation , foreign policy , trade policy and development cooperation
Some activities have already been developed at European Union level
In 1996 the European drug unit's mandate was extended to cover the fight against trafficking in human beings
When Europol is fully operational , it is our hope that these activities will be strengthened
A specific programme on the training and exchange of persons responsible for combating trafficking in human beings , the STOP programme , was adopted by the Council in November 1996
The Commission has also tabled two proposals dealing with temporary protection and solidarity amongst Member States in cases of mass influxes of displaced persons
These proposals will enable the Member States to cope more efficiently with situations like the one that we now face in Kosovo
new budget lines concerning the reception and repatriation of such people
The first preliminary report on the implementation of these budget lines has already been transmitted to Parliament
In order to tackle these migration flows , improved cooperation with the third countries concerned is essential
The framework for this cooperation , having regard to this part of the globe , is the Euro-Mediterranean partnership
One of the basic purposes of MEDA is indeed supporting economic transition and socio- economic development in the Mediterranean region
By doing that we contribute to increased prosperity in the region and hopefully reduce the pressures for migration
In addition , MEDA can support specific measures under the Barcelona Declaration to help cope with illegal immigration
We shall , for example , be financing a seminar in Spain for police training on this subject
We are also supporting a meeting in the Netherlands on a whole range of migration issues
It must be understood that , under its own regulations , MEDA cannot be used to finance measures in Member States to fight legal immigration
That would be against the regulation and , more important , it would send a wrong political signal to our Mediterranean partners
The Commission shares the view that improved cooperation at European level is crucial to manage immigration flows
The entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty will provide a good opportunity to enhance our efforts further and develop new and more efficient tools in all these areas
beings and also to improve the situation for victims
I was glad to hear the replies from the Council and the Commission before speaking myself
I agree that we need to take medium-term and global measures
However , that should not prevent us from taking other measures , immediately , to deal with the problems we are experiencing and those looming before us
some of those who try to cross it
They die in the attempt , having first paid their undertakers handsomely
Hundreds of human beings have died this tragic death
They only appear on our television screens if something extremely serious happens , as it did on the coast of Italy
The catalogue of deaths that take place every day goes quietly unnoticed , and is rarely in the news
Other people are detained and placed in camps which are more or less well equipped to receive them
keg , yet we in the European Union do not notice or do not want to notice what is going on
They end up herded together , living in cramped conditions in Ceuta or Melilla , for instance , two cities which are not far from their own country
I believe that the European Union does have the resources to deal with this situation , more resources than we sometimes draw on
I am referring , as did the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council , to the mechanisms provided under the third pillar for the control of cross-border traffic
to fight together against everything with contributes to this disaster
Nevertheless , Mr President , we must also take appropriate measures here and now to respond to the victims' plight
reach our shores
Very often , they do not intend to live in the southern European countries , but plan to continue travelling north
hope of reaching the countries of northern Europe
We need to deal with them , and we need centres where this can be done
Measures must be taken to control the Straits of Gibraltar , the Straits of Messina , and the most popular crossings
to regret the situation all over again
Mr President , the problem of illegal immigration deserves specific attention because of the intense human suffering involved
Not only are lives lost , but many people also fall prey to gangs of organised traffickers , who run criminal businesses , risking the lives of desperate people
illegal immigration
The fact is that the illegal immigration these gangs are involved in is essentially - I would stress - a crime
We need to target the organisation of these networks
Sanctions will have to be effective , however , and the various administrations will therefore need to cooperate
The legislative work undertaken by the Member States and the administrations themselves constitutes a great change
and asylum in the Union
This problem affects us all and , as we have often emphasised in this House , it can only be successfully resolved through cooperation
Such cooperation should also include the administrations of third countries
If necessary , European aid should be made conditional on strong government action against illegal immigration in those countries
reconsider Community aid to those countries when the MEDA programme is reviewed in 1999
Of course , countries which make a greater effort to stem the flow of immigrants will benefit from more favourable treatment by the European Union
The same applies to commercial and association agreements
the repatriation of illegal immigrants , which in my opinion will be of considerable help in resolving this problem
The solution lies in control and collaboration , and if the administrations do not collaborate , the situation will not be resolved
I very much fear that if we do not take appropriate measures , we shall have to mourn more tragic victims in the future
and in forthcoming weeks and months
The migration of peoples is part of world history
scarcity , poverty or persecution
- seems to me altogether illusory and over-ambitious , not to say stupid
Clearly the problem must be tackled not as a problem but as an opportunity , because migration will be our future in the next century
rebound against us
therefore be a major opportunity , not least an economic one
by demand , in line with the future requirements of our economies
to our own fellow citizens
becoming a wide-ranging problem with dreadful consequences for those who attempt to reach Europe
It is a problem which has much to do with the European Union's present approach to north-south cooperation policies
are expanding
their borders and often mete out inhuman treatment to the refugees
This is the situation with which we are faced
I believe the time has come for the European authorities to take swift and effective action to resolve this problem
Above all , the European Union must formulate , once and for all , a policy of genuine cooperation with these Mediterranean states
Such cooperation must be honest and fair and not be based solely on economic interests
Rather , it must attempt to deal with the structural and immediate causes of the migration flows
traffickers in an effective manner
designed to protect fortress Europe
el rechazo '
At the launch , Joaqu√≠n Estefan√≠a said , and I quote: 'The belief that these matters can be dealt with through recourse to economics alone is false
Europe must return to politics in the search for a solution to the Mediterranean situation'
Let us hope that this will be the case , and that history does not find us wanting yet again , for failing to live up to our responsibilities
foothold in our continent
They ask for asylum , they ask for jobs and they ask for lives for themselves and their families
as we go along , we improvise ad hoc rules , we guess what the Geneva Conventions say , etc
Even here , nationalist hypocrites are thriving , wrapped up in their sense of belonging to a bogus Christianity
That is quite convenient; the whited sepulchres are not there today
But meanwhile , the smugglers and crooks are making a fortune and dozens of drowned bodies are being recovered between Tangier and Algeciras
had no idea that things like that happened in our countries
For them it is a matter of survival
It is a matter of eating every day , of working , of existing and of being able to send their children to school
Europe , which is beset by its own problems , must not just sit back and build ramparts , in case it becomes a fortress
Our society obsessed with profit , our society of the cautious and short-sighted , might one day easily bring calamity to us all
Madam President , the European Parliament is beginning to show concern at the influx of illegal immigrants from the southern Mediterranean , and it is right to do so
respect , it is wrong
This reform , which has not yet been debated in France , has three main negative aspects
The first is the abolition of all controls relating to the movement of persons at internal borders within five years , including those relating to nationals of third countries
to enter and then scatter throughout the rest of Europe
The second is the European Commission's monopoly over the right of initiative , which would also become automatic after five years
the field of immigration
The third is the move to qualified majority voting on a simple decision of the Council , which would also be a mistake
In fact , the abolition of sovereignty and national frontiers would remove all sense of responsibility from the Member States
No-one would gain from that
nation and , if need be , to establish different forms of cooperation between the countries involved
Madam President , as I only have 90 seconds of speaking time , I shall have to confine myself to just three points
immigrants
As I see it this has to be the bottom line , the central principle of our policy here
economic circumstances could trigger a new wave of migrants at any time
open for both illegal and legal immigrants already in Europe to return home
the total - are not given asylum in Europe , but in neighbouring countries on the same continent , preferably countries which have basically the same culture as the country of origin
the 'open borders' policy
Madam President , the problem of migrants coming in to the EU from across the Mediterranean affects us all
Most come by sea but some come by land
visit the two Spanish towns in Morocco , Ceuta and Melilla , with my colleague , Terr√≥n I Cusi
Hundreds of migrants from both sub-Saharan Africa as well as from Algeria are increasingly coming into these two Spanish towns
The former are economic refugees and the latter are asylum seekers
partly by the EU
promptly disappear northwards
That is something that should concern us
Equally , however , we have the problem of the asylum seekers
Some of them are in my view genuine asylum seekers , suffering repression from the authorities and others in Algeria , and they of course are not allowed in
They are sent back to Algeria where they suffer oppression , torture and even on occasion death
What we need is a common European policy on these issues , as Sir Leon mentioned
It is a European problem - it is not just a Mediterranean one
We need to make sure that Europol helps to catch the criminal organisations that are engaged in this vile trade
and seek our protection
We equally need to put pressure on the countries of origin and countries of transit to make sure that they play their part in helping to staunch this flow
Finally , as a number of speakers have stated , we have to help remove the causes
We have to help make sure that we get economic development in the countries of origin
their families
These are difficult issues
In the climate of xenophobia we have in Europe , they are increasingly difficult; but they will not go away unless we tackle them
and assistance of clandestine immigrants and by negotiating specific measures concerning readmission
Mediterranean , in actual fact also affects continental Europe , which in most cases is the ultimate goal of most immigrants
individually - but is global and European
social and economic development in the countries of migration
integrated into Europe's social and economic framework and to develop their own potential to the full
civil fashion a migratory flow coming from poor countries , in some instances ones torn apart by ethnic wars , without there being a common policy in the European Union
as a result of famine and warfare
The Commission's umpteenth listing of figures today is pointless
What is needed is a firm stance , leading to the immediate introduction of a common policy on immigration
organisations themselves and the victims of prostitution rackets
Mr Caccavale
exposed to migratory flows - including illegal ones - but on the other is most encumbered with the burden of repeated refusals to take in the numerous immigrants and refugees
This can lead to dreadful tragedies at sea , as has already been recalled
All of this results from a lack of coordination with the North African countries and from the pressure of highly organised , highly efficient organised crime
told me how many millions of lire they had paid to middle-men to be brought to Italy , from where they would set off for Germany or the Netherlands
matter of numbers and monitoring: of course monitoring is required , but cooperation is required too , and this should not be left to the countries on Europe's southern flank
also fair to equip us to fulfil our tasks properly , not only of monitoring but also of cooperation and humanity
such centres , ones that are far superior to the existing ones in Italy and other countries
The substantial investment which is needed in this area must at the same time be directed to improving cooperation
I would also stress one further point: agreements with the countries on the opposite shores of the Mediterranean
Some interesting agreements have already been drawn up in this area , for example by our government
cooperation
Gibraltar , and an increased likelihood of the inhuman conditions that we have seen in the Sicilian Channel
Our mission , and the possibility of future humanitarian cooperation , would likewise be jeopardised
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we are all agreed that the pressure of immigration from or via North Africa to Europe is dramatically increasing
We are also agreed that it is the southern Member States that are most affected by it
The reasons for the migratory pressures are sufficiently well-known - I do not want to go through them here again , as we are all aware of them
But the southern Member States are not the only ones affected , all the European countries subsequently are , because as a rule , the destination countries lie further north
Germany and Austria are the first in line , and their ability to take people in and to integrate them are limited
But what is the Union doing
At present , we still do not have uniform or adequate instruments to meet the full extent of these new challenges
with it
We need other instruments and concepts for the remainder , in order to be able to help both them and ourselves
Here , I would like particularly to thank the President-in-Office for presenting a very comprehensive concept , developed with total responsibility
and to regulate immigration
We are not a fortress , but in the interests of eventual integration , immigration must be limited and controlled
the burden to enable integration and transitional entry to Europe
We need a completely new overall concept that will produce these solutions
I am confident that this is the beginning of a discussion that will end positively for the whole of Europe
deal with these problems
In no way are the illegal bodies washed overboard from these flimsy craft the responsibility of one Member State alone
We must all play our part in dealing with this problem
tenfold
The southern Mediterranean countries are begging us to make a determined effort to come up with solutions quickly
Yet the levelling-out - if that is indeed our aim - has to be achieved through favourable treatment of those southern countries , giving them advantages , making their task easier
Promises of financial aid alone are not enough
We have to be seen to act
European dream
which awaits young people in Europe if they do not possess the necessary documents
It is both laughable and incredible that the European Union as a whole should declare itself powerless to fight against these mafias which exploit human beings , namely impoverished youngsters
We need to create opportunities for temporary emigration , with offers of jobs and training
Madam President , were you aware that the very doors we are opening to young people from the CEECs are being closed to young people from the Maghreb
We need to give them a better reception , showing greater respect for their dignity
After all , we are decent human beings
use empty words to describe a non-existent European wonderland
in search of solutions to the most pressing problems in their daily lives
What we are discussing today , however , is a flow of migration into the southern flank of Europe
Spain and Italy are being besieged by migrants fleeing from the conditions in their home countries
corpses have been washed up on the coast of the south of Spain or the north of Africa , and a shameful traffic in human beings has developed
Clearly , we cannot remain indifferent to it
Ladies and gentlemen , this problem will not be resolved through a debate on whether the Union's borders should be open or closed , or through repressive or police action
It will not be resolved either through the Geneva Convention or regulation of the right to asylum
The problem has to be approached from a position of human solidarity , through the economic and social development of the migrants' home countries
balanced , stable zone
are valid instruments through which to express our solidarity with the development of the people of the Mediterranean
Countries such as Morocco , Algeria or Tunisia must receive special priority treatment where the Union's foreign and cooperation policies are concerned
The Commission and the Council must include meetings and ongoing studies of migration flows in their schedules
to resolve these problems
The Commission itself has gained first-hand experience of the work under way during its visits to the town of Melilla , and also to Ceuta
However , resources are needed
In this area too , an effort must be made to help the European countries responsible for policing and controlling our borders , a task which is often unrewarding indeed
I should like to leave you with a final thought on illegal immigration
We should stop talking about the fight against illegal immigration
Instead , we should talk about the fight against those who traffic in human lives , and about the fight against drug traffickers
We should not and must not give the impression that we think of the migrants as invaders or criminals , because that is not what they are
Thank you , Madam President , for allowing me to speak at the end of this debate
As I am sure you are aware , the Liberal Group has signed the joint motion for a resolution
the southern Mediterranean
We must emphasise that it is essential to put a stop to this influx of immigrants
What is more , there is no doubt that the misery that has just been described affects us all deeply; we have to find a solution to it
mentioned today
that the only solution to their sorry fate is to flee to the countries on the other side of the Mediterranean
We must hope that the authorities in the southern Mediterranean countries will cooperate fully with the Member States of the European Union in implementing measures to control illegal immigration
We believe , too , that the police treatment of illegal immigrants and the legal provisions relating to them are inadequate
Community policy must focus more on improving development in the Mediterranean countries and , consequently , the future prospects for their citizens
Allow me to add one comment in conclusion
These policies are in direct competition with other policies for which budgetary assistance from the European Union is desired
useless
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I have followed this discussion and debate with great attention
debate
culture and other related items
In the European Union of course , we very much try to provide support for countries south of the Mediterranean Sea , i
e
North African countries
I would point out that we are also trying to conclude free trade agreements with them
But we should also be aware that , unfortunately , many of these agreements fail because of the quota problem
I do not want to go into detail here but I think you all know what I mean
Secondly , of course you are right that improving the economic situation is of fundamental importance when it comes to seizing the problem of migration by the roots
It is something that we are all aware of and are working on
In the MEDA programme , especially , there is a lot of money for this purpose
On the whole , there are enough funds and I would like to emphasise that
Thirdly , I believe - and I said this in my statement at the beginning - that , on the question of migration , we must tread a new path
The instruments that the Geneva Convention made available to us are no longer enough today on their own
other
without always being able to count on the solidarity of every Member State in doing so
as you know accepted between 85 000 and 90 000 refugees
That is almost equivalent to 8-9 % of the Austrian population and is the largest per capita share
That is why we must call upon solidarity from all other countries as well
This is the basic idea behind our strategy paper , which does of course still need to be debated and revised , but on which we can ultimately reach a consensus
paradise here , that we also have unemployment and that they cannot automatically expect to be taken in
But I would also like to say that exactly the same applies to the central and eastern European countries
My country harbours the same fears about those countries as Spain probably does about the Maghreb countries
Finally , I would like to mention the despicable trade of trafficking in human beings
The Austrian presidency has tabled a draft for a convention on this within the UN General Assembly , partly in cooperation with Italy
countries but also for the whole of the central European region
not repeat myself
Thank you , Mrs Ferrero-Waldner
I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 40(5)
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
EU/Hong Kong
the European Union and Hong Kong (COM(97)0171 - C4-0214/97)
Madam President , when the handover of Hong Kong took place on 1 July 1997 many fears were expressed as to how the situation would develop
It was widely acknowledged that if the transition was unsuccessful there would be far-reaching implications for political and economic stability in the region and for relationships between world powers
was more successful than many of us would have dared to hope
in my report and which the European Parliament must continue to observe closely
The holding of elections on 24 May this year marked an important milestone in the development of democracy
The relatively high turnout is an emphatic answer to those who would argue that Hong Kong residents are not interested in democracy
However , this satisfaction is tempered by the fact that the electoral system is less than fully democratic with too much power vested in the hands of the elitist functional constituencies
Suffice to say that as a consequence 140 000 functional constituency voters elected half the Members of the 60-member LegCo whereas 2
8 million voters were able to elect only 20 members for the geographical constituencies
It is unacceptable that despite winning a clear majority of the popular vote , pro-democracy parties obtained a mere third of the seats on the Legislative Council
was put in place for holding all elections on the basis of universal suffrage
Additionally , a free and democratic society cannot exist unless the rule of law operates , untrammelled , within its borders
The rule of law requires that all laws apply to all citizens equally , that they are enforced impartially , that they are justiciable in open courts accessible to all
a check on the others , thereby ensuring that none can abuse its power
of law and if necessary drawing attention to any democratic or constitutional deficit which is inhibiting the application of the rule of law to the citizens of Hong Kong
case call into question the efficacy of the rule of law in the Hong Kong SAR
These concerns have been intensified with the passage of the Adaptation of Laws bill
As regards the protection of human rights , a number of issues perturb me
The introduction of the concept of national security is a worrying development
We must ensure that it is not used to curb political dissent as has been done in the People's Republic of China
are all warning signs confirming the need to monitor the situation and to guarantee that there is no erosion of fundamental human rights and freedoms
The European Union has a very important role to play in the evolution of Hong Kong
The EU must fully support by deed and action the continuation of Hong Kong's international autonomy in economic and trade matters
We must pursue cooperation at all international levels , particularly as a partner in the WTO
passport holders
Our strategy must at all times consistently and continuously underpin the 'one country , two systems' concept
annual report
I look forward to receiving that report and our committee will respond in due course
Finally , I would like to thank all those who contributed to the drafting of this report
I welcome the cooperation from all political viewpoints on the committee
Of most significant importance were the views I received from within Hong Kong itself
I hope we have advanced the debate
I hope this is a balanced report and I hope it charts the way forward
Madam President , it is customary on these occasions to congratulate the rapporteur on his work
What is perhaps less customary is the fact that I actually mean it when I congratulate the rapporteur on his work
This is a good , thoughtful and thorough report
I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur on the way he went about producing his report and the cooperation he showed with others in the committee
The report has taken on board many of the observations we made in discussion in committee
That has meant that we have managed to keep amendments to the minimum and thereby kept the cohesion of this report
I think that is important
I should like to thank him for that
This report emphasises the importance of Hong Kong to the European Union and indeed to the global economic system , as we have seen in the last few weeks
But our main message has got to be , quite frankly , that we have to recognise that the hand-over of power has gone very well
The worst fears of many people , expressed in this Chamber , have not been realised
The idea of 'one country , two systems' appears to work
There has been political , press and religious freedom
There has not been widespread corruption as was feared
Indeed the high quality of the Hong Kong civil service continues to shine through
Of course there are areas of concern and Mr Cushnahan has outlined some of them
There have been questions about political influence being used for appointments to statutory advisory bodies such as the housing authority
That is an area that needs to be watched
There were rumours that Chinese security advisors were to be installed in the Chief Executive's office
I am glad to see that was denied by the government
There was the attack on Radio Television Hong Kong by a member of the Chinese Peoples' Political Consultative Conference
While the Chief Executive , Tung Chee-hwa was somewhat dubious in his response , President Jiang Zemin was very clear in condemning any influence in Hong Kong affairs
and other international broadcasters , thus helping guarantee its neutrality
Our main concern was always about the existence of the provisional legislature
We must recognise the positive step forward reflected by the elections to the Legislative Council
of the franchise in the functional constituencies and the possibilities for abuse of corporate voting in the functional constituencies through the registration of shell companies
We therefore look forward to full democracy in Hong Kong as soon as possible
There have been concerns about some of the decisions taken in the Hong Kong courts , which Mr Cushnahan describes in detail in his report
One particular issue is the question of the immunity of state bodies from prosecution and whether this applies to the New China News Agency
That worry has been accentuated by the case of Emily Lau , who has been involved in dispute for nearly 12 months with the New China News Agency
The precise status of the New China News Agency should be clarified as a matter of priority
The rule of law , as Mr Cushnahan has said , is crucial to the future of Hong Kong
Article 23 of the Basic Law
How Hong Kong handles that will be a key to the continuing success of 'one country , two systems'
without interference from China , but with support from China
I would be interested to hear Commissioner Brittan's observations on that aspect
Clearly Hong Kong has to have autonomy in its own economic affairs but it also has to have the support of China
Finally , I would endorse Mr Cushnahan's remarks about granting visa-free access to residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
I believe this would be an important step forward in developing greater commercial ties between the European Union and Hong Kong
In conclusion , I would say so far so good; in fact , better than we had hoped for
develop Hong Kong's important status as a keystone in the Asian economy
Madam President , this high-quality report from Mr Cushnahan should serve to enhance the profile of the European Parliament
The background information provided in part B is illuminating and offers a sound basis for the proposal for a resolution
Hong Kong's economy grew rapidly thanks to extensive economic freedom , a culture of individual enterprise , generalised private saving and free trade
Per capita GNP is now higher than in some EU countries
Hong Kong's success story demonstrated early on the advantages of a market economy system over old-style socialist economic planning
spirit of economic reform in China
In the run-up to the handover to China , there were many who felt that , ideologically , Hong Kong was taking over China
Be that as it may , few would dispute that China has - so far at least - broadly respected the agreement it entered into regarding Hong Kong
Economic freedoms ultimately form the basis for freedom in the wider sense and the system guaranteeing those freedoms has remained intact
As Mr Cushnahan says , a number of worrying things have nonetheless been happening recently
Elements of the democratic structures that were built up have been undermined
This Parliament and the European Union as a whole must keep a watchful eye on developments
By adopting this resolution , we will be putting down a marker in that regard
We need also to take steps in our own countries to alleviate the situation , for example through generous visa policies and a commitment not to introduce trade restrictions
For many years , Hong Kong was a refuge for large numbers of people fleeing repression and dictatorship
Let us use our influence to maintain it as a home for freedom in the future
Madam President , the Commission communication is called 'Beyond 1997'
Well , we are beyond 1997 and the sky has not fallen in
I organised a visit of MEPs to Hong Kong at the time of the elections to the new LegCo in May of this year
It was the fourth such visit in four years
the freedoms to which they have become accustomed in recent years
Hong Kong retains economic autonomy too: its high-rise economy has withstood the pressure of the financial turmoil from Typhoon Thailand
The actions of the Hong Kong monetary authority may not have pleased classical economists , but their response bore the hallmark 'made in Hong Kong' and not 'made in China'
Yet , as this excellent report shows , it is important not to be naive
A democratically elected Parliament has been abolished and replaced by a new Legislative Council rigged in favour of Beijing and against the free will of the Hong Kong people
A sometimes supine judiciary , and suspicions of self-censorship , give grounds for concern
There has been a gradual but consistent repeal of human rights laws and undermining of institutions essential to their protection
The new police guidelines on demonstrations , issued a week ago , are just the latest example of this
by supporting education in democracy in Hong Kong
There is an unseemly haste in Europe's new approach to China
Tony Blair , as the Prime Minister of a Member State , is visiting China this week and almost ignoring human rights
President Santer must not show the same myopia when he visits Hong Kong for the Commission next month
We live in a time replete with political possibility
by their actions
Our watchword must be vigilance
Madam President , we have all been surprised to see that Hong Kong has remained one of the most free and open markets in the world since the UK handover
a special administrative region in China , is determined to maintain transparency and the strict application of the laws of the market
one-off measure
in the Asian crisis and in the crisis at home
Finally , it would be extremely useful to hear how the EU bureau has expanded its activities and in particular to receive a report on its human rights monitoring
I have talked to colleagues who know Hong Kong better than I do , and they are extremely uneasy
I think we should ask for a report as soon as possible
Lastly , I congratulate Mr Cushnahan on his report , which has the support of my group
part of the vast nation of China
Whatever happens from this point on in that province of China cannot but be influenced in one way or another by that historic fact
suspicion and mistrust , and not , I would say , by good faith in what is happening
There is something wrong with everything , everything must be regarded defensively and with doubts
He goes so far as to say: elections for the legislative body are all very well , but they are suspect , undemocratic , because the electoral system is not democratic
Mr Cushnahan , what kind of electoral system is there in your country
In my own
In all the European countries
Are we happy with those systems
Are they supremely democratic or are they anti-democratic
and what must happen in Hong Kong as if it were populated by Belgians , Germans , Englishmen , Greeks and other Europeans
But Hong Kong is populated by Chinese , and what goes on there is mainly if not exclusively their business
There is even a naive view that what happens in Hong Kong in one way or another may become a springboard for changes all over the vastness of China
us to meddle in China's internal affairs and bring about changes which suit our own purposes
That is not the right attitude , it does not help relations between the European Union and China
(The President cut the speaker off)
Madam President , the most important message emerging from Mr Cushnahan's excellent report is that China has fundamentally respected the agreements it entered into on Hong Kong
We find that this former British colony de facto enjoys a greater degree of democracy today than it did during a large portion of its time under British sovereignty
This confirms the impression I received when the China delegation visited Hong Kong in June this year
I am not saying that there are no problems
Reference has been made to Article 23 of the Basic Law , which could be used as a tool for infringing democratic freedoms
This is a point that requires careful monitoring
The ILO is currently looking at trade union rights , which for me are of vital importance
We must draw attention to any problems in that area
Lastly , let us not forget that Hong Kong is an integral part of China
Developments in Chinese policy will affect the former colony more than ever before
The EU must not start pushing reform in a way that will trigger mass unemployment in China
We do not want to see Russian-style social chaos overtaking the country
That would be disastrous and put a halt to any form of democracy
Hong Kong's relatively positive position would also be threatened
Madam President , up until now China has , at least formally , fully honoured the commitments it had made regarding Hong Kong
We should be pleased about that
However , the establishment of a form of parliament such as exists in democratic countries is not likely to happen before 2008
Universal suffrage for the election of all of the citizens' representatives will not come into effect for another 10 years
We must be extremely vigilant over these 10 years and show great solidarity with the democratic forces at work in that country
The public authorities have until now maintained Hong Kong's reputation as an open and incorrupt business centre , as Mr Cushnahan very rightly pointed out
But this seemingly exemplary attitude , this openness to the world must be supported and encouraged in an environment which is far from favourable
the citizens of the European Union have access to Hong Kong without a visa
The high volume of trade and movement of people , ideas , capital and goods is of vital importance for Hong Kong
We must be committed , active and supportive in these areas
It is not only the wellbeing of this advanced region of China that is at stake , but also our own wellbeing
Madam President , the Asian , and particularly the Chinese , economic area holds immense potential for the European Union
Without a doubt , Hong Kong plays a key political as well as economic role as regards links with the region
That is why good relations with the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region are of great importance for the European economy
of constitutionality which has been justifiably criticised
Only a democratic order based on the rule of law can be regarded as the guarantor of a permanently independent Hong Kong economy
On the issue of visa-free access to the Schengen area , I cannot agree with the rapporteur's current request for this to be given to all HKSAR and BNO passport holders
In my opinion , this question should be treated separately , as the Commission has suggested
its inhabitants , and for what it can mean for a country as important as China
In my own case , being Portuguese , the situation is of particular interest given its inevitable implications for the integration process for Macau
That will take place , a quarter of a century after the Portuguese revolution of 25 April 1974 , under conditions that are much more favourable from every point of view
quality of life of its population , including the airport , the university , the new port , the waste processing plant , etcetera
its population
have every interest in its continuation in the future
openness and development of which it may be proud
preferably , by opening a representation in Macau , whose administration , we are sure , would not fail to offer whatever support was needed
Madam President , I am one of those who have visited Hong Kong since the transfer
Things have developed very differently from what we expected just over a year ago
At the time , the thinking was that in economic terms maybe things would be fine in Hong Kong , but that in political terms things would go very badly
As my colleague Mr Watson and many others have said , we must remain very vigilant
That is the usefulness of this report on the political side
In practical terms one must acknowledge that in the Hong Kong situation , overall , the development of - albeit a limited - democracy has been scrupulously observed
At the present time the concern is rather with economic developments taking place in that part of the world
If things go wrong economically they will certainly have a negative political impact
I should like to ask the Commission one specific question , touching also on the visa issue
Of course we should not only be concerned about visas
That is quite true
Nevertheless it is one of the few specific things where Europe as a whole can do something more
admit visa-holders to Europe
The Commission can play a role because Schengen will be incorporated in the Treaty of the European Union
I hope that the Commission will say that it will take an initiative on this point
This is the kind of concrete solidarity which we must maintain
I hope that with next year's report we can say that things are better than they are at the present time
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , may I too welcome Mr Cushnahan's admirable report and the motion for a resolution
I would like to comment on some of the key points
the handover and on the broad adherence by the Chinese authorities to their political commitments
I would welcome those statements and I entirely agree with what has been said
and to introduce it as successfully as has been done is a remarkable achievement; tribute is due both to Hong Kong and to China itself for that fact
Nonetheless , a number of critical points have been made and Mr Brinkhorst summed it up by saying that we must continue to be vigilant
And so we shall be
The resolution calls for the acceleration of the introduction of universal suffrage
development of the democratic process with the ultimate aim of universal suffrage'
I can assure you that the Commission will continue to pay close attention to the development of democracy in Hong Kong
to introduce universal suffrage by a reasonable and specified date in the future
us to do , and as Mr Pradier has also urged us to do
There are signs that the financial crisis to which Mr Brinkhorst referred is already emboldening those calling for more democracy in Hong Kong
I can assure you that is a point on which President Santer and I will not be silent when we visit Hong Kong at the beginning of November
Referring to the visa question , the European Parliament resolution urges Member States to grant visa-free entry to SAR passport holders , and Mr Burenstam Linder has drawn attention to that
Hong Kong's efforts to secure visa access
That is one key way in which the European Union can support Hong Kong's economic autonomy and reinforce the one country/two systems concept
eight referred to admit visa-free only BNO passport holders , but there are only two Member States that allow visa-free SAR passport holders , who are of course in the majority
It is equally important that Hong Kong should convince European countries that its immigration , policing and customs procedures are efficient and reliable
We have urged them to run special visitors' programmes for European national officials with that in mind
passport holders
about applying that to Macao as well
economic reform in China , notwithstanding the current problems related to the Asian financial crisis
Within the WTO there is good cooperation between the European Union and Hong Kong
Hong Kong is one of the staunchest supporters of our initiative to launch a new millennium round , and the Commission regularly discusses Beijing's WTO membership bid with Hong Kong
Hong Kong of course supports it , and provides a unique example to China of the benefits of WTO membership
The resolution also calls for wider cooperation in order to strengthen EU-Hong Kong relations and reinforce Hong Kong autonomy
We believe that stronger bilateral ties are vital to the underpinning of the one country/two systems concept
also exploring the possibility of more ambitious agreements
can do to the maximum possible extent
last year in Brussels , and the second will take place in Hong Kong during our visit there at the beginning of November
The motion calls on the Commission to monitor the autonomy and financial stability of the Hong Kong market
visits of high-ranking officials to Brussels
That monitoring will be reflected in our first annual report on Hong Kong which we will be publishing shortly
that situation , for all the difficulties that Hong Kong is currently undergoing
During the year Hong Kong has acted to increase liquidity , for example by cutting the savings tax and by expanding its repo market
resulting fall in share prices
discipline on the stock market
We are analysing those measures closely and will comment on them in our first annual report
be increased
resources of the office
end of October
As I mentioned , President Santer and I will be visiting Hong Kong at the beginning of November , so the publication of our report will be timely
It will look closely at the full range of relevant economic , political , judicial and other issues that have characterised Hong Kong life during the first year of the SAR
the points made during this debate
Thank you for that very comprehensive reply , Commissioner
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
Question Time (Council)
The next item is questions to the Council (B4-0483/98)
I should like to welcome Mrs Ferrero-Waldner , President-in-Office of the Council
Question No 1 by Patricia McKenna (H-0832/98)
Subject: Mistreatment of journalists in UK
court orders and erasing their video material , as well as restricting their public access during protests
Is the Council further aware that , although written police guidelines do exist for relations with the press , journalists have not been allowed to see them
Do such activities breach the Treaties , including the Treaty of Amsterdam , in particular the articles relating to Justice and Home Affairs , for which the Council is largely responsible
before pursuing that issue elsewhere
fall within the Council's remit
I can therefore tell Mrs McKenna that the Council has not discussed this matter at any time
of the country concerned
Europe , of that there is no doubt
It is true that the Council cannot rule out occasional shortcomings at local level
would have no future
I just wish to point out to the President-in-Office that there is written and video evidence concerning this harassment
Treaty states that the European Union shall respect the European Convention on Human Rights
This is an abuse of that Convention
These journalists were covering social justice and environmental issues
against protesters in evidence
This is a gross abuse of the freedom of the press and of the freedom to report what is going on
If you allow it to happen in one Member State , it is the thin end of the wedge: it is going to happen in other Member States as well
There is an onus on the European Union , if it adheres to the EU Treaties and respects the European Convention on Human Rights , to do something
It is not enough to say that sometimes , as the President-in-Office said , the Council cannot prevent occasional shortcomings
to follow suit , because freedom of the press is an extremely important aspect of democracy
Mr President , Mrs McKenna , our remit is clearly laid defined
forces as regards measures to uphold public order in the sovereign territory of a given Member State
Member State
Mrs McKenna's question would therefore probably meet with a greater reaction if it were to be asked in the UK House of Commons
Commission of Human Rights
Mr President , I listened to the first answer given by the President-in-Office and to the one she has just given
for some kind of intervention by the Council
But I would like to put a supplementary question
were debating a little while ago
The report refers to such matters and we considered that we were fully competent to intervene , debate and criticise , and the Commissioner praised those points
country
I should like the President-in-Office to explain her view , and perhaps she could forgive me for my attitude , but such occurrences and such answers are very vexing
Mr President , Mr Ephremidis , I have to tell you once again that we only have certain powers
The Council is indeed responsible for external relations and that is why it can talk about a lack of press freedom in a third country
It is not responsible , however , for internal matters , such as the conduct of police forces in a Member State
I can only repeat the answer that I gave a short while ago to Mrs McKenna
Question No 2 by Felipe Camis√≥n Asensio (H-0836/98)
Subject: Funding of the Almendralejo-Oviedo gas pipeline
the programme for the distribution of natural gas in that Member State
the Council of 5 June 1996 on a series of guidelines concerning trans-European networks in the energy sector
south of Valencia and Murcia , and also with a liquefied natural gas facility in Galicia
the specifications for projects of common interest cited in Decision No 1254/96/EC , so that financing could be provided
In the Decision of 14 May 1998 for the years 1997 and 1998 , the Commission made a sum of ECU 103
16 million available from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) to support the entire Western Gas Pipeline project , of which this pipeline is a part
In this case , the President-in-Office of the Council has not responded like Pilate
In fact , she has replied very succinctly , and I am very grateful for the information she has provided
This gas pipeline is of great socio-economic importance
We should not forget that this is a corridor , all covered by Objective 1 of the Structural Funds , and with hidden potential for development which has to be exploited
However , I do have some supplementary questions
Does the programme outlined to us complement the Interreg IIB Community initiative concerning trans-European energy networks
Further , does it also complement the Straits of Gibraltar - C√≥rdoba gas pipeline , through which Spain receives natural gas from the Maghreb
Finally , have these programmes allowed for the current tendency towards a reduction in the consumption of natural gas , evident in many Member States of the European Union
In other words , had the Council foreseen this tendency towards reduction
Mr President , Mr Camis√≥n Asensio , these are questions of detail that you are putting to the Council
as to whether or not this also falls under INTERREG
I cannot , unfortunately , provide any oral information on this but if you wish , I would be happy to answer in writing
Question No 3 by Roy Perry , which has been taken over by Mrs De Esteban Mart√≠n (H-0838/98)
Subject: Petitions
made concerning the failure of Member States to honour their Treaty obligations
petition
are applied
'
Madam President-in Office of the Council , I appreciate your reply , but I am sorry to say that I am not happy with it
indeed be present at meetings of the Committee on Petitions
As you are aware , the right to petition is a fundamental right of European Union citizens
an appropriate way to such justifiable petitions from Community citizens
Committee on Petitions , and when this might happen
takes formal note of all the resolutions approved by Parliament
carry out a careful analysis of each element of the dossier , and take appropriate measures if necessary
Of course , the Council is very concerned with the application of the provisions of the Treaty and the secondary legislation
the Commission , and where necessary the Court of Justice , that ensures that Member States are correctly applying Community law
That issue has already been addressed in this case
I am a very experienced and active member of the Committee on Petitions
In the past , a few years ago , an official from the Council used to attend the committee regularly
This lady just took notes , which was not very satisfactory , but it was better than nothing
to the committee - which is welcome - but very rarely when there was a matter of particular concern to one of the Member States
Most of Parliament's committees are regularly attended by representatives of the Council
We are not talking about ministers but of a civil servant from the representation of the government holding the presidency at that particular time
Parliament
That will help our petitioners and it will be in accord with the Treaty of European Union and the rights of the citizen under that Treaty
Mr Newman , thank you for that comment , we shall ask the Council Secretariat to look into it
I shall talk to Secretary-General Trumpf about this , and if it is as you say , then a solution can certainly be found
That is very kind of you
Question No 4 by Olivier Dupuis (H-0849/98)
Subject: Results of the Dayton agreements
the territory of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina , while nearly 1 million were refugees in third countries
Moreover , again according to the UNHCR , only 400 000 of these roughly 2 million refugees and displaced persons have returned to date to their place of origin
community
Mr President , the Council agrees with Mr Dupuis that far fewer refugees have returned than the international community had been expecting for 1998
That is true
The return of refugees constitutes one of the main challenges facing the international community in the implementation of the Dayton/Paris Peace Agreements
the situation still further
Many refugees are disinclined to return to Bosnia , or at least to their original homes and villages , often even where they will be part of the majority
Apart from the obvious political constraints , other key factors are the absence of a sense of personal safety , and the availability of jobs and housing
the police service , and of creating a sustainable improvement in economic prospects , thus encouraging refugees to return to their country for good
The Council will never accept the ethnic partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina
It entirely supports the ideals envisioned by the Peace Agreement of pluralism and multi-ethnicity as the key to full democratisation and lasting peace
The Council would like to reaffirm the fundamental right established in the Peace Agreement of all refugees and displaced persons freely to return to their homes of origin
It continues to support fully the use of the High Representative's authority to remove any public official who infringes this right and attempts to prevent refugees from returning
EU's regional approach , which was established in April 1997 for all countries in the western Balkans region
for human rights and minorities , and the slowness in helping refugees return
Madam President-in-Office , you stated that the Council would never recognise the partition of Bosnia
We have heard so many false promises and repudiations from the Council that it may be rather risky to say such a thing
But on the subject of the refugees , your comments are more like wishful thinking than an actual policy
situation
We should also ask ourselves what exactly Bosnia is today
It is certainly not a state in any real sense of the word
break its promises there , as you suggest , then it would certainly not have sent multinational troops , and would not have such a heavy commitment there to this day
It is precisely because we want to implement the Dayton Agreement that we have all agreed on involvement and it will continue
and at all national levels of government
For the first time the whole of the State Executive was able to support the Peace Agreement
all levels of government
they will still be putting the prime minister forward
As for the Croats , the new member of the State Executive , Antejelavic , is going to organise a meeting of the party in October in order to reform the HDZ
The EU has the following thoughts on these developments
Firstly , measures need to be taken to guarantee the coherence of the Sloga coalition
Secondly , the Republika Srpska should be shielded from the effects of the Kosovo crisis
Thirdly , at the HDZ party conference , more specific reforms should be decided upon
Fourthly , the preparations for the local elections in 1999 should be taken in hand
Finally the integrity and transparency of the financial conduct of elected bodies should be ensured
pluralistic Bosnia
to it is Mr Milosevic
In the course of the last few years we have seen that he is not at all willing to keep to any part of the agreement
There has been very minor progress in a few areas
The greatest advances by far which , while not being enough , at least represent progress have come from the Croats
and West Slavonia is concerned
Big concessions have been made on the Croat side
that the Dayton Agreements have no real value , aside from the symbolic
We should consider the possibility of deferring certain elements of the agreement as long as he is one of the parties to it
Mr President , Mr Habsburg-Lothringen , there are a good number of areas in which the Dayton Agreements have certainly brought advantages
with one another again
But of course not everything is perfect , particularly as far as Milosevic is concerned , and we are aware of that
I just think that there were hardly any other alternatives under the circumstances
To suspend the Dayton Agreements now is , to my mind , not a good alternative either
The civil society and democracy must be strengthened
designed to do just that
The continuation of the economic reforms is another reason why Bosnia and Herzegovina should still receive support from the international community
a democratic Bosnia and Herzegovina , and here I think that the international community has achieved something in the last few years
and of the territorial units
fact that the host countries have offered them a new home , in a truly generous and remarkably humane manner
back home
so quite generously
Today , in the discussion on migrants , I told you that 85 000 to 90 000 have been admitted to Austria
That is equivalent to 8-9 % of the Austrian population
Nevertheless , our goal must be to return the refugees as far as possible
It is their home and they must rebuild their own country
security so that they have some guarantees when they go back to their country
Question No 5 by Jos√© Salafranca S√°nchez-Neyra (H-0853/98)
Subject: US-Cuba relations
which was published by newspapers and other media
Does the Council intend to respond to this letter or take a stance on this matter
the remarks made to the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs in May by the Commissioner responsible
Does the Council agree that this agreement represents an extraordinary reaffirmation of the principles underlying the Liberty Act
Committee , Jesse Helms , on the 'Understanding with Respect to the Disciplines for the Strengthening of Investment Protection'
This is a part of the important package agreed at the EU-US summit meeting in London on 18 May
The letter was not , however , addressed to the Council and therefore it would not be appropriate for the Council to respond
on 25 May
The Council accordingly looks to the US to take the necessary steps arising out of the London summit package
The EU will similarly respect its political undertakings
retroactive legislation with extraterritorial effect
This is the position of the Commission and the Member States
information from the United States it appears that , having regard to the discriminatory provisions of Cuba's Law 851 , the expropriations in a number of cases were contrary to international law
Thank you very much for your reply , Madam President-in-Office
Obviously , I had not expected the Council to reply to this letter
It is a letter addressed to the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the United States Senate by the Secretary of State
as a basis for the philosophy and general aims of United States legislation
I should like to know whether the presidency agrees with that interpretation
I am aware that the European Union does not agree with it , at least not according to the unilateral declaration issued in May
The first question I would therefore like to put to you is this: what reaction does the content of this letter produce in the Council
the Act to take place , since this requires the approval of the US Congress
to ensure the amendment of Title IV of the Act
to elapse before some other measures are taken
Union contemplate
It is all very well to seek an amicable solution , but as I see it , this is not altogether appropriate , given that this Act lacks an acceptable legal basis
of course as Austria's State Secretary
the EU-China human rights dialogue if necessary
We are currently considering this
I believe that a new form of dialogue could naturally have positive effects on EU-Cuba relations , and also perhaps on the EU/US/Cuba triangle
As to the detail of your question , I have to tell you that at the moment a change in the position I have outlined is not likely
But as I said , if I have interpreted things correctly , I can see some fairly positive opportunities for the future
implicit in Mrs Albright's letter
Can she assure us that we will stand by the statements which have been made on a number of occasions in this House , at least by Sir Leon Brittan
effectiveness of these
The EU's policy here consists of two main features
Firstly , dissuading the US from internationalising bilateral problems - in this case between the US and Cuba - by applying extraterritorial legislation
US approach of bringing pressure to bear and of threats
That would be my response to your question
A number of questions have in fact already been put to the President-in-Office
a letter Mrs Albright has written to Mr Helms
In fact that letter is surprising , to put it mildly
to European businessmen wishing to invest in Cuba
not at all clear , has disrupted investment in Cuba
any business wishing to invest in Cuba
We still think this is a cause for great concern , and I appreciate the reply from the President-in-Office
would like the situation to be clarified
Mr President , Mrs Gonz√°lez √Ålvarez , allow me to state my view on this once more
At the end of May 1998 , Cuba claimed that with the summit agreements the EU had in fact accepted the principle of extraterritoriality it had always previously fought against
embargo was essentially intact
Titles III and IV of the Helms-Burton Act waived
Cuba also warned the EU at the beginning of June 1998 against inciting opposition groups and human rights activists
Such subversive activities would not be accepted by the Cuban administration and could result in appropriate measures being taken
from the central statements of the common position
not the imposition of a secondary boycott and retroactive legislation with extraterritorial effect
This is the position of the Commission and the Member States
As I have already mentioned , the issue of expropriation has been commented on by Sir Leon Brittan
Question No 6 by Gerhard Hager (H-0854/98)
Subject: Strategy paper on EU migration and asylum policy
On 1 July 1998 the Austrian Presidency tabled a strategy paper on EU migration and asylum policy
What progress has been made in the discussions on the strategy paper tabled by the Austrian Presidency
Which delegations have already made written submissions to the K4 Committee
What is the content of these submissions
Has the current Presidency already dissociated itself from many areas of the proposal
If so , from what areas , and why
promote further thought and consideration about how to get to grips with problems in the areas of migration and asylum
to ensure that in determining such policy , the decision-makers have at their disposal as broad a basis as possible on which to take their decisions
and from the Commission
In the light of these comments , and also of observations made by all delegations at the K4 Committee in September , the Presidency is revising the document
This revised version will be forwarded to the European Parliament through official channels as soon as possible
This will also be the first version that we have been able to forward , because the opinions of the fourteen other delegations have not previously been included
But , just to repeat this , I would like to dispel any misunderstandings that might have arisen from incorrect reports in the press and some of the other media
meantime
Of course I have followed the discussion here this afternoon , and I am glad to have the information available at present confirmed by an authoritative source
But let me ask a supplementary question
I assume that the wording used in Articles 41 and 132 is still valid
They say that a shift towards less constitutional and more politically-oriented concepts of protection in the field of asylum would also be perfectly feasible
If this is the case , then I would very much like to know what the Council position is
Mr President , Mr Hager , I cannot now respond in detail on each piece of drafting , because I do not have the text in front of me
I can only tell you that we gave a discussion paper to the press and another paper was discussed in the press even before it was made official
That led to certain misunderstandings
A paper which is to be officially debated by various bodies is of course not going to contain wording that could be offensive in any way
I have already explained that there was a certain misunderstanding - we clearly never intended to do away with the Geneva Convention
But it needs to be expanded in certain areas , as I explained in our discussion today
Secondly , this is not a new subject
In 1991 it was discussed for the first time , and in 1992 and 1994 it was taken up by the Commission
As our discussion has shown , this question is certainly extremely complex today
way to create humanitarian possibilities for refugees , and take in those people who are most in need of help
I have the document we are discussing in front of me , and I was both surprised and disappointed to see what it contains
Plenty of repression and very little humanity characterise this Austrian proposal
Practice at the EU's frontier points is already somewhat brutal and this would only make the situation worse
Illegal immigration is effectively being encouraged and we see hundreds of deaths every year as a result of illegal attempts to cross the borders
If the policy advocated in this minutely drafted text were to be implemented , refugees with a justified claim to asylum would not even reach the EU
Tighter visa rules and more stringently enforced carrier liability would prevent them from filing their claim
Unfair demands would be placed on our neighbouring countries , with the EU expecting them to apply unbelievably restrictive measures
Relations between the various Central and Eastern European countries could well become disrupted if they were forced to close their borders
I have one question for the President-in-Office
Reference is made here to the SIS register , which is currently used to check asylum-seekers
Yet we know that this register lacks elementary legal safeguards
Asylum seekers have no right to see the information recorded and cannot therefore verify whether it is correct
Might the presidency consider taking steps to enhance legal certainty for refugees by allowing for more effective scrutiny over the SIS register
which the positions of the other Member States have only just been included
We really must wait until the paper is officially forwarded to the European Parliament and then we can hold a discussion on it
I appreciate that perhaps there has been some confusion about this report , and that it is simply a discussion paper
have hoped from the earliest stages
the next meeting of the Judicial and Home Affairs Council
individual right to seek asylum
Convention
war or chaos in society from which the authorities of their country are unable to protect them
Many of us feel the individual right must be preserved
Mr President , Mr Elliott , on your first point , the Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees is not to be encroached upon in any way
any passage which could honestly give rise to such an idea
all the Member States , before the European Parliament until it has been handled by a Council working group
That is precisely our procedure here
After the first revision , this text will be made available to Parliament as soon as possible
Question No 7 by John McCartin (H-0860/98)
Subject: Cost of motor vehicles and vehicle insurance in Ireland
this contributes to a distortion of competition in the single market and are any initiatives being taken by the Council to resolve this situation
Mr President , Mr McCartin , as the Honourable Member rightly points out , the creation of a single market for motor vehicle insurance has been a priority for many years
The third coordinating Directive on non-life insurance (Council Directive 92/49/EEC) basically completed the internal market in the insurance field
Alongside the non-life directives designed to safeguard both the right of establishment and freedom to provide services , the Council has in addition adopted legislation concerning compulsory motor vehicle insurance
The aim of the general and specific legislation is to ensure that all Community citizens have access to the widest possible range of insurance products
This increases competition in this sector and should in time lead to reduced costs for insurance
car sector
Its aim is to ensure a better balance in contractual relationships between manufacturers , dealers and final consumers
specific field
I thank the President-in-Office for that very detailed reply
Perhaps I made a mistake in putting this question to the Council rather than the Commission , because there is immense frustration in Ireland , with young people in particular
Young men looking for their first job , if that job involves driving a car in Ireland , have to pay something like ECU 50 for insurance per week
If they were in Brussels or in a city in the UK , they would probably pay only a quarter of that
So it is felt that the European Union has failed to bring about a single market in the whole area of insurance
and this has some knock-on effect in the insurance sector , but it is not sufficient to explain it
to enforce the right of establishment and the right to equal access to the market
that there is transparency in car prices across the whole of Europe
as you rightly suspected , it would be in a position to answer your questions considerably better and in more detail
In the insurance field , I would refer the Honourable Member to Directive 92/49/EEC , which aims to regulate activity in this sector and ensure greater competition
necessary to remedy matters appropriately
Mr President , Madam President-in-Office , do you think that the introduction of the euro will lead to more transparency in the cost of cars and motor insurance
Mr President , Mr R√ºbig , the only thing I can really say to that is yes , of course
I think it will certainly increase competitiveness
It will naturally also mean stronger competition and lower prices , because better comparability will allow consumers to look all the more carefully at where they actually buy
I believe that the introduction of the euro will definitely have positive effects for the consumer in the long term
law
There are many such examples , which are dramatic at a personal level
I agree with Mr McCartin
So I would like to ask: can anything be done for this special category
And , in any event , is there a date beyond which we will be able to say that the prices of cars will be comparable throughout the European Union
Because the fact is that we have been talking about this in the European Parliament for decades
Mr President , Mr Alavanos , I quite understand the problem you have raised here like the honourable Member who spoke before you
are respected
Allow me also to remind you that fixing insurance premiums falls within the remit of Member States
that individual rules on competition are complied with
Incidentally , I would be happy to pass this on to them
Mr Posselt has a point of order
Mr President , I only have one question
took requests for the floor and before you stopped taking them
The President-in-Office may therefore have received the inaccurate impression that there were only critics of the paper here
There are also strong supporters of it
But that was not reflected here at all
I am sorry , Mr Posselt , but I gave the floor to the Members who asked first
I am sorry you were not called , but under the Rules of Procedure I can only give the floor to two speakers
Question No 8 by Anna Karamanou (H-0862/98)
Subject: Role of the media in the increased sexual exploitation of women
According to a recent statement by the Council of Europe , women are the main victims of sexual exploitation using the networks , which constitutes a serious violation of human rights
trade are making increasing use of modern media and new technologies
What action does the Council intend to take and what measures will it adopt in response to this serious problem
are an extremely serious problem
The Council's position is that everything should be done to prevent international criminals working in prostitution from making increasing use of the latest information and communication technologies
measures to combat violence against young persons , women and children (DAPHNE)
The presidency is confident that , with the impetus it gives , Member States will be able to find a joint basis for adopting these instruments
level
the United Nations is in a good position
I am therefore certain that the Community and the Member States will devote their full attention to initiatives taken under the auspices of the UN
on the rights of the child , which deals with the sale of children , their sexual exploitation and also child prostitution and pornography
Union about such a vast problem - tragically little
the slave traders of today
level and of establishing common sanctions and penalties that fit the seriousness of the crime
International criminal networks certainly call for an international and multi-dimensional response , as the Minister herself recognised
on more explosive dimensions and which is an affront to our very civilisation
resources are available to enable that service to fulfil the increased workload it is undertaking
Mr President , Mrs Karamanou , allow me once again to point out that the matter you have raised is an especially important one for the Austrian Presidency too
We have also taken a series of initiatives in this area
and which I reported on this morning
We are beginning to discuss this important problem and look for solutions not only in the EU context , but also with all the applicant countries
Significantly , Europol's powers have been extended to include this area
The aim is not just to create more bureaucracy , but to try to fight this evil that you correctly identify together and effectively
I would point out that in the last two years the Council has already adopted countless decisions that are now being applied
Council conclusions of 19 March 1998 on 10 principles for an action plan proposed by the G8 to combat crime in the leading sectors of technology
I have here a cutting from a Finnish newspaper which came out last week
The article describes in detail the methods cited by previous speakers for changing women's identities , dyeing their hair and branding them with tattoos once they have been recruited
I note with satisfaction that the Austrian Presidency believes this to be a priority issue and commend its action to date
Yet I worry that we may be taking too many decisions and doing too little to follow them up
You cited the DAPHNE programme , Madam President-in-Office , and I wonder when the Council intends to adopt it
I am also keen to hear whether the Council and the Austrian Presidency support action to rehabilitate young girls
Bulgaria , for example , has introduced a programme called La Strada
candidate countries
against organised crime
Justice , Anita Gradin , attended
institutions the opportunity to exchange experiences in the field of prevention and intervention and to develop further strategies to fight trafficking in women in eastern and western Europe
The European Parliament and the Commission are to run a campaign next year against violence against women
The Austrian Presidency has also organised a conference on the work of the police against violence against women
It will be held from 30 November to 4 December of this year in Baden and aims to contribute to the preparation of Member States' activities for 1999
taken to combat acts of violence perpetrated by men against women
police
problem
Mr President , as you know , many criminal acts are now perpetrated on the Internet
This is also true of child prostitution and trafficking in women , and the trade in organs which often goes with them
We now know that the DAPHNE programme is to be launched for a longer period up to the year 2004 , and that it is to be quite generously funded
take appropriate countermeasures as a remedy and to combat crime
Mr President , Mr Pirker , you have indeed raised a very topical problem here , to which the Austrian Presidency is devoting great attention
Since the Internet is a completely new medium , every possible measure must be examined closely
We have to look at what can be done on the Internet
Maybe we should be thinking in terms of some type of code of conduct for the user , because it is going to be very difficult to develop specific legislation
shall have something ready for presentation
Question No 9 by Astrid Thors (H-0867/98)
Subject: Reduced VAT for labour intensive activities
Commissioner Monti at one time proposed that the Member States reduce VAT on labour-intensive activities to encourage job-creation
The Commission recently carried out an analysis of the impact of VAT on the internal market , employment being one of the aspects covered
When does the Austrian Presidency intend to have this matter discussed by the Ecofin Council
some delegations on the subject
question
I regret that I cannot give any further information on this at the moment
replies to the Council working group
I wonder why it took so long before they were given a proposal to which to respond
The Commission produced its communication on 13 November last year
It is now October 1998 , one year on , but the timetable has still to be set
Why the delay
There are rumours that no conclusions will be drawn in the Council working group until the end of the year at the earliest
Yet we have 18 million unemployed
Many of us are convinced that the measures being discussed could be the answer to reducing tax fraud and increasing jobs
Our current self-service society might then shift towards a proper service society
Mr President , Mrs Thors , firstly of course I share your concern about the level of employment and about the need to combat unemployment wherever possible
That is not in question
it even further
In fact , the Council is of the view that the employment issue constitutes the greatest challenge for the EU at the turn of the millennium
I personally am deeply convinced that the future generation of Europeans is going to measure Community policy by the success it achieves against the scourge of unemployment
in relation to all the implications tied up with it
That is what is presently happening
It is currently under review , and a suitable proposal will be put forward at the appropriate time
But because of the complexity of the situation it is too early at the moment to make specific statements on content
Taxation offers us a way of dealing with our desperately high levels of unemployment and creating more jobs
Fiscal policy is primarily a national matter , however
We all know how sensitive people are to being told by the EU what tax policies they should adopt
I should like to take up the second part of the President-in-Office's answer
Perhaps we could hear what types of general measure the presidency plans to introduce before the end of its term
jobs
Has the presidency any plans to come forward with specific proposals before the end of the year
European Council which should be approved at the European Council in Vienna
countries
In other words , we learn from each other
At the moment we are also looking at how additional jobs have been created in the various countries
and practice alongside each other - and which has made us the leaders in youth employment
Similar ideas are being looked at very closely by experts , so that models that other countries have found useful can also be taken on by others
This is the direction which the Austrian Presidency's guidelines on fighting unemployment take
Mr President , in relation to the labour-intensive industries the problem is competition from third countries , the cheap labour countries
If we reduce VAT we do not improve competitiveness since there is VAT on the imported as well as the home-produced goods
So we probably only expand the market a little bit and give a bigger opportunity to the cheap labour areas
I have this problem in my own constituency
manufactured in Morocco
improving the competitiveness of European industry
Is it a question for Member States or is it an initiative that must be taken by the European Union
Would it be in violation of our obligations under GATT
Something needs to be done or we will have no clothing , footwear and such labour-intensive industries
Mr President , Mr McCartin , thank you very much for that comment
You are right of course that the measures that are now being discussed will have an impact within the whole context of globalisation
On the issue of reducing labour costs - how would this be passed on
These questions are also particularly important in the framework of the Lom√© negotiations that we have just begun
you were right in making the point that every aspect of tax management naturally has a major effect on the entire global economy
Thank you , Madam President-in-Office
It is now 7 p
m
and I am afraid I have to bring Question Time to an end
I commiserate with those Members who have been waiting patiently , but that is the way of things here in Parliament
We also owe it to the President-in-Office to stop at this point , so that she can catch her flight home
Thanks to her once again
Questions Nos 10 to 29 will receive written answers
These which will be put in Members' pigeon-holes this evening
That concludes Question Time
(The sitting was suspended at 7 p

and resumed at 9 p

Pollution-related diseases
in the field of public health (1999-2001) (Rapporteur: Mr Cabrol)
pollution-related diseases
not to take direct action to combat the emission of pollutants , nor to combat pollution-related diseases , as has already been the objective of other directives
The current programme aims to review existing knowledge of pollutants , to collect all available data on pollution-related diseases and to draw up a list of these pollutants
and can protect themselves as far as possible against them
It is therefore essentially a programme to produce a list of pollutants and the diseases they cause
It is also an information programme for the public on pollutants and related diseases
That is what we want to reassert in the amendments tabled: the first part of Amendment No 5 and Amendments Nos 10 , 12 , 13 and 14
pollution-related diseases , I personally will not support the last paragraph of Amendment No 5 , nor Amendments Nos 9 and 16 , which go beyond the scope of the present programme
This programme also aims to pool the experience of the Member States , international organisations and various third countries
Naturally , a programme of this nature will need to be evaluated while it is in operation and any follow-up monitored
On the whole , we believe that the common position is satisfactory
We welcome , in particular , the fact that it covers diseases related to all forms of pollution , as we had requested at first reading
Nonetheless , there are certain points on which we take issue with this text
the common position
Furthermore , the duration of the programme has been reduced to three years , although it was set at five years in the original proposal
Consequently , the financial framework , which is set at ECU 1
3 million per year , is now limited to an overall total of ECU 3
9 million
We could accept these changes in the duration and funding provided this proposal was actually , as the European Commission claims , only a first step in this field
programme to be extended once again to five years , and for the overall financial framework to be set at ECU 7 million
This is the basis of Amendment No 7
pollution-related diseases
That is the aim of Amendment No 11
of pollution , as we stress in Amendment No 15
cooperation rather than international agreements as such
Finally , I would like to highlight , in particular , the evaluation and follow-up of the programme
The European Commission takes the view that it would be premature to draw up a report during the third year of a programme's operation
In Amendment No 8 , we ask that the report be drawn up once the implementation of the programme is complete
ensure that this programme is consistent with and complementary to the other programmes in the field of public health , the environment and research
That is the aim of Amendment No 6
This should also help us to make the necessary adjustments , as requested in Amendment No 1
programme to be followed by other , more ambitious proposals setting out the measures to be taken to combat effectively the formidable consequences of pollution
Madam President , I will begin by saying that the proper speaker this evening , Kirsten Jensen , is ill
I hope it has nothing to do with the pollutants which we do indeed notice here in Strasbourg
We are confronted with a classic dilemma where the EU and health policy are concerned
The real powers to implement health policy lie with the Member States and not the EU
It is the Member States which decide what taxes and insurance rules should apply in this area
We also know that a large part of health policy is further decentralised
to them
Yet it is not really the EU's business to solve these problems
- most important of all - by ensuring that its own policy is healthy , integrating health aspects into both transport and industrial policy
The Treaty of Amsterdam enables us to do this
one reads the Commission's budgetary proposals , or strengthening it so that at least it meets the expectations it awakens
Our choice is for the last option - hence the amendment from the Environment Committee calling for a bigger budget
be worthwhile
For that reason , we propose that ECU 7 million be set aside for this programme
link between pollutants and diseases
It may , we hope , lead to more effectively integrated policy on the environment and health
It is one thing to explain to people that they should not go out when there is smog , but it is another matter to prevent smog from arising
hence eliminate the exposure which causes the rashes
It is further necessary to develop a better understanding of diseases such as multiple chemical syndrome or damage caused by hormone-altering substances
These diseases and their links with the modern chemical world are an uncharted problem area
I therefore look forward to the Environment Committee's health hearing later in the autumn , which will be dealing with the field of health impact assessment
We know that it is worthwhile to link policy on the environment with that on health
We can see that lead and sulphur emissions are gradually disappearing from our cities
We hope that this will also have an effect on the related diseases
In other words we have everything to gain from integrating health aspects into policies
People's Party
At the same time , we must remind the Commission that , although we are offering our full support , we are still in need of more documentation
documents on the basis of which it drafts its proposals , so that we perhaps might be able to avoid some inappropriate interpretations or interventions
Amsterdam - , but we need to let all the citizens know that the European Union is concerned about these issues and is launching complementary methods of working and of organisation
states , are working to guarantee consistency and complementarity in all their policies
I therefore believe that we must be positive in the message and support we give to this programme
At the same time , however , we must provide information for the citizens and explain to them why we are undertaking such programmes
to take decisive action
years to buildings such as cathedrals , that are centuries old , than they have in previous centuries , they will be aware that something is happening
If our forests have decreased by 30 % , it is because something is happening
In short , we cannot imagine humankind being able to put up with more damage than cathedrals and forests
This therefore gives us a clear - and I would say urgent - reason to act
And , of course , everything related to respiratory diseases and allergies gives cause for alarm
Over the last ten years , the number of allergies has multiplied by 120
In short , we support the complementary proposals , Professor Cabrol's amendment and the general proposal from the Commission
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Liberal Group supports the Cabrol report , but we have two comments
people increasing concern
Having a notification centre for these problems would give people confidence that there was somewhere where they could report their suspicions about illnesses or allergies
The Netherlands already has a notification centre and my country , Flanders , is also looking into the subject
Consumer Protection has apparently accepted their position
When we talk about environmental health problems in my country we are mainly thinking of air pollution , such as near incinerators
The disturbing incidence of children with genetic defects and cancers brings home the fact that there are serious and even life-threatening diseases involved
This action programme must make the authorities , industry and the general public realise how certain pollutants can affect human health
We need to learn the necessary lessons for the future , such as that incinerators must not be located in built-up areas such as Drogenbos on the outskirts of Brussels
Finally , we wholeheartedly welcome this action programme and we hope that it will promote greater knowledge and better prevention
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , our group agrees with Mr Cabrol's report and thanks him for his excellent work
The process of forming a correct and comprehensive European Union public health policy has a number of gaps that are gradually being filled
What is more , we believe that we are moving in the right direction since the action programmes are actually meeting this need of the population and the citizens
to the model of industrial development that exists in the European Union
This is why we think that the proposal being put forward is highly relevant , as are all the amendments tabled by Mr Cabrol
epidemiological studies
We also support those aimed at improving public awareness and perception , because it is in this way that individual and collective behaviour will gradually begin to change
Finally , the European Parliament must carry out the necessary follow-up work to ensure that this is effective
However , we are still concerned
We are taking action , but our growth model is the cause of these diseases , and this cause must be attacked at its source
Madam President , firstly I am rather surprised that our rapporteur Mr Cabrol has said that he is not supporting Amendments Nos 5 , 9 and 16
These were accepted by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection and represent the committee's position
Furthermore , these points are extremely important because one relates to actions to prevent pollution-related diseases , one to combating pollution-related diseases and , finally , one to the whole issue of allergies
I would like to point out to the Commissioner that in the original Commission proposal these were all included
After the Council met it was decided to exclude these extremely important requirements
I would hope that the Commission will take on board Parliament's position , which is the position of the Environment Committee
going to be put on a shelf and nothing done about them
It is extremely important that action is taken to ensure that we reduce the amount of pollution-related diseases
In any city in Europe you can see the amount of respiratory and allergy problems caused by pollution in our cities
We have to reinstate Parliament's original position and the original Commission proposal
It is no good carrying out studies which we are not going to follow up
The onus is on the European Union to tackle the pollution which is causing health problems and which could be avoided
This must be tackled; without ensuring that action is taken , it will not be effective
Furthermore , a timescale has to be brought in
Three years is not enough
We need at least five years
As well as that , funding is extremely important
We need to increase the amount of funding
Madam President , in welcoming this report I should like to pay tribute to the rapporteur
Mr Cabrol has certainly earned the respect of this Parliament for his commitment to protecting our people from the effects of pollution
I recognise that the common position adopted by the Council is an advance in this field but , like many other Members , I do not feel it goes far enough
By reducing the duration of the programme from five to three years , financing for it has effectively been cut
Consequently we must question the Council's sincerity in seeking to address what is a major area of concern throughout the European Union
We need a more ambitious programme
I worked on the proposal for a sharing of resources amongst Member States , international organisations and third countries
I firmly believe that the views of the sufferers' organisations should also be included
Many of these organisations are doing valuable work by collating information on the effects of pollution and related diseases
Such an organisation in my own area has drawn attention to the use of organaphosphorous sheep-dip
Information which can only be provided by such organisations should be taken on board
will be realised
to enjoy the protection now planned
Mistakes have been made in the past
We must now take the opportunity before us
The chance is there to put those mistakes right
clearly established or even quantified
This prevents , for example , justice from working effectively
People die but no-one is responsible and no-one is to blame
We must not only focus on just the concept of pollution
Various technological methods are used whose impact on health has not been seriously analysed
fertility to fall over the last 30 years in western countries
It is outrageous to hear a European Commissioner state , here before the House , that the market will decide whether a product is good or bad
That negates the essential nature of research and prevention , and , in particular , is an admission that we are treating people like guinea pigs
I would like to thank Professor Cabrol for shedding a little light on this rather nebulous world
And I would like to thank Mrs McKenna for trying to make the report even more effective
Madam President , this programme is practical proof of support for the efforts being undertaken today to investigate and prevent diseases caused by pollution , i
e
by environmental conditions and hazards
result of probable synergism between various pollutants
These effects may be toxic , infective , allergenic , carcinogenic , and indeed they may be acute or chronic , reversible or not , local or systemic
Exposure to these reactions may take place by breathing , by ingesting food , by absorption through the skin , or directly , as happens with radiation
We should also note that through the placental route , harmful substances from the environment may pass from the mother to the embryo and do it harm
Consequently , all environmental hazards that have adverse effects on human health and produce diseases ought to be monitored epidemiologically
even have an impact on the resistance , ageing and life expectancy of the human organism
The phenomenon must therefore be investigated for pathogenic interactions between two or more environmental pollutants , as mentioned in Amendments Nos 12 and 13
so that these risks to the health of Europe's citizens may also be reduced , as envisaged in Amendment No 15
be recorded and that conclusions will emerge concerning effective ways to combat diseases caused by or related to environmental pollution
16
To conclude , Madam President , I believe that Parliament ought to vote for this programme because it will contribute directly towards improving the health of European citizens
Madam President , the issue of pollution-related diseases is a really important and topical one , as the Commissioner well knows
Diseases caused by pollution are on the increase in all the industrialised countries
Combating these diseases cannot , however , be just a matter of health policy , but their prevention requires action in all areas of social policy
I can give you one example of a Finnish success story regarding the reduction of lead in the atmosphere
Lead is one of the most dangerous heavy metals , causing , amongst other things , retardation in the physical development of children
In one decade in Finland we brought about a dramatic fall in the lead content in the atmosphere by reducing the tax on unleaded petrol , i
e
through a policy of taxation
An important aspect of the programme now under discussion is passing on to one another any useful experience we have had of the matter , as in our case
I give my enthusiastic support to the rapporteur's view that the original length of the programme should remain at five years
I also support the suggestion that the financial framework for the programme should be increased toECU 7 million
pollutants , and to do so independently of direct action to combat pollutants of the air , water and ground , which falls under other programmes
to improve the draft decision , unanimously adopted by all the political groups within the Committee on the Environment , will also be adopted by the House
the state of health of the EU's citizens
Let me thank you , Mr Cabrol , for your work on the proposal and , indeed , for your support for the common position
The proposal is a key element of the Community's overall approach to the prevention of pollution-related diseases
Pollutants persist in our environment because it is not always feasible to reduce or limit them for technical or economic reasons
by the various forms of pollution
The prevention of pollution-related diseases through better understanding of how the pollutants cause or aggravate them is one of the objectives of the proposed programme
Emphasis is also placed on improving knowledge
This is a key point made by Mr Cabrol - how health risks are perceived , assessed and managed
Respiratory diseases and allergies , which are of increasing public health concern throughout Europe , are an area which the Commission considers should be given very special attention
I agree with Mrs Ojala there
We propose sharing the experience that exists right across the Union , reviewing the effectiveness of preventive measures undertaken and reinforcing and promoting successful actions
I note that Parliament is particularly supportive of this activity
At the first reading the Commission accepted four of Parliament's amendments
Subsequently the Council adopted a common position and to avoid any ambiguity I will say immediately that the Commission has accepted the common position
But I will not hide from the House that the Commission does not consider the common position to be perfect
I address that to Mrs McKenna
The curtailment of the scope and the duration of the programme is particularly regrettable to me , to say the least
A statement to that effect was placed in the Minutes
However , the Commission considered that the political compromise in the Council was the best that was available at the time
Consequently the Commission is only able to accept two amendments today: Amendments Nos 1 and 15 , since these do not have legal or budgetary consequences for the common position text
The Commission is unable to accept the other amendments for the following main reasons
Amendments Nos 2 and 8 imply a duration for the programme beyond the three years set out in the common position
Amendments Nos 5 , 10 14 and 16 extend the scope of the common position beyond policy development
coherence
of meaningful , large-scale epidemiological studies
Amendments Nos 3 , 12 and 13 would lead to omissions or inconsistencies in the text
I should like to emphasise that the Commission considers that we need to have this very important programme on pollution-related diseases in place as soon as possible
Then we can look forward to some extremely useful work on a subject of growing public concern
What we are trying to do here is to get ready for the new framework programme
The aim of this particular programme is to see how we can influence policy in that public health framework
I should like to say that to Mrs Kestelijn-Sierens and Mrs McKenna since they also make the point very strongly
We really are now trying to develop policy initiatives so that after the three years we can move into the mainstream and do better in the new framework
I also agree with Mrs Hulth√©n that we need better links with research
That is being taken on board
All in all I have to thank everybody who contributed
in the new framework
Thank you , Commissioner
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
Rare diseases
of public health (1999-2003) (Rapporteur: Mr Viceconte)
Madam President , several thousands of people in Europe are affected by rare diseases , some of them of genetic origin and extremely serious
In some ways , these thousands of European citizens seem to have been left to their own devices
limited by the relatively small numbers of people affected
the field of public health in Europe for the four years 1999-2003
people most directly affected - the sufferers themselves - and their families to be involved in the programme
This could be a good opportunity to establish real Community cooperation by setting up a programme on rare diseases , pooling knowledge and then taking the best possible action
Indeed , it is necessary to avoid duplication , which wastes time and money and leads to inefficiency
only two in full and four in part
At the initiative of your rapporteur , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection has adopted 20 amendments for the recommendation for second reading
These are now being tabled again and will form the basis of discussion at conciliation
The situation in Europe varies from country to country
In some Member States , data are collected and measures are more or less well organised; in others this does not happen
diseases concerned
These data must be fed into a central European database and made available to everyone
only
Nevertheless , your rapporteur draws attention to the inadequacy of the budget
The Committee on the Environment has once again proposed the sum of ECU 14 million , as opposed to the ECU 6
5 m proposed for the five years of the programme's operation
It is likely that , at conciliation , the usual clash will occur with the Council on this matter
There is no point in salving our consciences by presenting a programme of great value in health and humanitarian terms , unless it is endowed with adequate funding
This is not a way of either saving face or salving our consciences and , above all else , it will not meet the expectations of sufferers and their families
Nor does the committee agree with the Council on the subject of comitology
We prefer an advisory committee rather than a mixed advisory/management committee , which would ultimately restrict the Commission's activities
adopted by the Council to be entirely inappropriate and unwarranted; it would appear , moreover , that the Commission too has reservations in this regard
group or other directly relevant NGO
the principal agents of accurate , early diagnosis
By the same token , in the draft regulation on orphan medicinal products , the Commission also proposes to involve general practitioners
Health and Consumer Protection , which have been accepted by all the political groups
well as expense , travel and inconvenience for treatment
The rarity of these conditions has made it very difficult until now for each Member State to collect data and information , and of course to engage in prevention and cure
Therefore the Commission's initiative of proposing a programme of Community action on rare diseases has been very well received by the European Parliament
Moreover , we had pressed for it several times , especially since the Commission had also announced - and has now presented - a proposal on orphan medicinal products
more generally , NGOs in various countries which are funding research into different rare diseases , and all bodies likely to follow through this action programme
Let me dwell just for a moment on funding
is much more so in this one
The rarity of these diseases does not admit of a proper , thorough approach in any one of our Member States
It really can be said that the serious problem of rare diseases can only be tackled on a European scale , so as to create the necessary critical mass
It is very short-sighted of the Member States not to wish to fund adequately this European programme , which could lead to results that are unimaginable in an individual country
the Committee on the Environment , and endorses the call for this programme to be better financed
Europe should not let this major opportunity pass it by
The European social model offers opportunities which are not offered by the system in the United States , but our internal divisions also sap our cultural and economic energies
For the sake of these most unfortunate citizens , the Member States should welcome Parliament's proposals , which I very much hope the Commission will support
Madam President , we fully support the proposals put forward in Mr Viceconte's report as well as Professor Poggiolini's remarks
here
groups and implementing actions to deal with clusters of rare diseases - , to tackle what I believe are the two most fundamental issues
These issues are the initiatives designed to increase the number of specialist doctors and those designed to strengthen high-level reference hospital centres
And in this context we will be unable to fully extend such initiatives to all countries and regions
rest of the proposals and initiatives that are provided for in the programme
Madam President , I think that all of the speakers support Mr Viceconte's report on the programme of action on rare diseases
various groups
These are amendments that were relevant but that were not finally accepted by the Council
doing so is supported by the Committee on the Environment - to include the amendments in this second reading that he deemed to be of particular importance
In the short time I have available , I will focus on four of these amendments that are of particular importance to both the rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment
Firstly , I should naturally like to stress the issue of funding
be effective
Therefore , the rapporteur proposes - and the Committee on the Environment approved his proposal - an increase in funding from ECU 6
5 million to ECU 14 million
Secondly , a central database is very important
Information is collected in the various countries but we need a centralised data base that allows for the exchange of information
Thirdly , we propose that a consultative committee be set up
We always have disagreements in this Parliament with the Commission over comitology
in coping with it
Madam President , the action programme on rare diseases which we are debating supplements a series of efforts to improve public health in the European Union
The field on which the programme focuses is in itself a particularly important area in which to adopt Community measures
lack of appropriate means - in other words resources , networks and organisations - for the identification , monitoring and effective combating of these diseases
group for the contingency where several cases of rare diseases occur all together , as happened for example in the case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or new-variant CJD
The programme concerns rare diseases , i
e
those with fewer than five cases per 10 000 people
Since these diseases have to be combated by a combination of efforts , the programme we are voting on should be promoted
there is a need to support action to cooperate with the sufferers and their families and with organisations that are active in the context of those diseases
treatment and prevention of rare diseases
public but must also include the potential to provide immediate assistance
To achieve the programme's objectives , we consider that the budget for the period from 1999 to 2003 should be set at ECU 14 million , and not ECU 6
5 million as proposed by the Council
To conclude , Madam President , I should like to ask Parliament to vote for this programme , as formulated by the Committee on the Environment
to prepare the report
The added value of the European Union's action is particularly obvious in this area
and cure
On the whole they have a limited impact on public opinion
more common conditions
Thus , it is clearly sensible for the Member States to come together through a Community mechanism which will coordinate the actions , which would otherwise take place in isolation
Mr Valverde L√≥pez's point is very well taken here
professionals and researchers
This is the very point made by Mr Traketellis and I support his point of view
It is one of the main ideas behind the programme
We also want to foster measures to strengthen the voluntary organizations involved in supporting people directly and indirectly affected by rare diseases
This corresponds exactly with what Mrs Marinucci thinks is important and we agree
an important matter also
rare diseases where the commercial return is insufficient
You first saw this proposal last March during the first reading
At that time you adopted 28 amendments of which 16 were accepted either fully or partly by the Commission's subsequent amended proposal
reserve on the common position with specific reference to the Council's treatment of these amendments from the first reading
6 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 15 , 17 and 19
10 are considered to be unacceptably limited; No 18 is covered elsewhere , and No 14 is unacceptable because of budgetary reasons
I shall elaborate a little on the reasoning behind the two key amendments , No 14 (the budget) and No 15 (the committee)
I know that the budget is an issue that Parliament feels very strongly about
The Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection has voted again for ECU 14m for the years 1999 to 2003
The financial perspectives as they currently stand simply do not allow for such a sum of money
Some progress has been made since the first reading
The common position has introduced a financial envelope of ECU 6
5m over the five-year period
And that gives the programme at least a clear budget situation and certainly goes beyond 1999
So the amendment concerning the programme committee is partially acceptable
The Commission agrees with Parliament as regards the preference for an advisory committee , rather than a mixed advisory management committee as favoured by the Council
This is part of the Commission's reserve on the common position
The experience gained from the implementation of the existing programme shows that a mixed management advisory committee is inappropriate and excessive especially considering the limited budget allocation
However , the Commission cannot accept that one of the two representatives from each Member State must be drawn from voluntary organisations
We say that from a legal point of view
This is not in line with the comitology decision and would affect the right of Member States to appoint the delegation
I would end by saying that I hope that Parliament will give a favourable vote on the programme
We share the desire to put in place Community action for this neglected and often forgotten area of real human suffering
a European rare diseases database
The problem will be dealt with and addressed during the implementation phase
Thank you for that reply , Commissioner , and for answering all our colleagues
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
Activities in favour of consumers
and Council Decision establishing a general framework for Community activities in favour of consumers (COM(97)0684 - C4-0077/98-98/0028(COD))
Madam President , we all welcome Commissioner Monti into the Chamber to reply to this debate
protection
It is a chapter that will begin with the creation of DG XXIV and the arrival of the formidable Mrs Bonino
and safety
It will cover President Santer's response in January 1996 to that crisis and the consequent undertakings written into the Treaty of Amsterdam
the Community will benefit from common action for all its citizens
and healthy market and community
In urging the adoption of my report I should properly declare a non-financial interest myself , as an elected Council member of the Consumers' Association of Great Britain
Eisma , and most notably Mr Pimenta - I am glad to see him present today
Mr Pimenta flits between the parties , but his heart is always in the right place as it is in this debate tonight
I should especially like to thank my assistant , for whom this report was the culmination of four years of specialised work in this area
It is for her an appropriate introduction to her new life in the Commission
We have no time to lose in debating the Commission's proposals
They need to be accepted by Parliament and the Council by the end of this calendar year
were rightly adopted after the BSE disaster
all of the 375 million citizens of our Union
I may be told that I cannot take the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty , and therefore of the draft Article 153 , for granted
Maybe
policies and activities , extending monitoring , promoting consumer information and education
Indeed the last of these is at the heart of what the Commission is now doing , in alliance with long-established and embryonic consumers' NGOs throughout the Union
The coming of the euro adds to this need for greater consumer awareness
a Commission which has been strapped for the money to do what is necessary
has had to launch
We have to will the proportionate means to match these pious ends
Otherwise , this Parliament is just an empty vessel
We have to be able to say what is necessary
That is why , in my own amendments , I propose an increase over the next five-year period to prevent a real deterioration in consumer protection
This amount would be ECU 130 million over five years , as opposed to ECU 114 million from 1999 onwards set out in the original proposals
health protection , the monitoring of hazardous materials and products , information on the euro and access to justice
citizens of Europe is a necessary provision , and one which was not taken sufficiently into account in the original proposals which came to us from the Commission
I have some reason to believe that the Council would accept some amendment of this order
We look forward to their proposals , perhaps next week
2000 , would produce a financial envelope for the legal base of between ECU 120 million and ECU 130 million
We are not saying here that this is a matter of endless increase
I have said in my report that there are elements within the current consumer budget , like the financing of EHLASS , that really should not be there
They belong in another part of the Community budget
If they were moved to it there would be a saving to the 'consumer' appropriation of over ECU 7 million over the five-year period
The British presidency acted swiftly to untangle the knots caused by the European Court of Justice ruling which it sought , together with other Member States
I should like to commend the Austrian presidency which has shown considerable dispatch in moving towards a viable and sufficient legal base
They deserve our salutations for that
Europe's consumers and citizens
Allow this modest proposal to go through
public
The only single market worth having is the one where we can all make informed choices about what we buy , what we eat and how we live
This report is intended to bring that one small step closer
Madam President , may I begin by greeting Mr Whitehead , not only in his capacity as rapporteur , but also as chairman of the consumer protection inter-group
His work has been outstanding and this report , which I fully support , bears this out
This report was urgently needed
A legal base is necessary and it is positive that the Commission should have proposed it
However , there are points that must be improved , in particular access to justice , which Mr Whitehead mentioned
Amendments Nos 16 and 33 are essential
When I held that particular responsibility in Portugal , I found that rapid and efficient access to justice was one of the key elements in protecting the consumer
BSE crisis
Amendments Nos 4 , 6 and 22 seek to move towards a solution to this problem
Third , the Commission proposal is inadequate regarding the impact of the euro and the achievement of genuinely single markets , particularly in financial services
We already have immense experience of countless cases of contracts where consumers have been taken in by misleading advertising or bad contracts
I support Amendments Nos 24 and 26
Fourth , the effective implementation of European legislation and its correct application by the Member States
It is certainly necessary to continue and to improve what has already been done , but the Commission proposal is defective here
Fifth , the guaranteed review of the present action programme following ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam (Amendment No 21)
It is essential that the Commission should present the revised version after ratification
to 20)
I wish to end by supporting the rapporteur's statement regarding the budget
persons who will thereby also be supporting the construction of Europe
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I think that it is vital to pursue a proper policy of consumer protection
Portugal , Greece and the Irish Republic would certainly become less efficient if this ruling continued to jeopardise certain categories of discretionary expenditure
established for the implementation of the existing general framework
million over the next five years
education and information , and the promotion and representation of consumers' interests
It is , however , also important to support the scientific committees and experimentation , so that the information campaign will adequately promote access and participation by consumers
currency , continued growth of the information society , accession of the applicant states to the EU , and information on food safety and quality
speeded up
Madam President , greater consumer protection for ordinary citizens is imperative
I support the recommendation of this report to increase expenditure on consumer protection by 15 % for the period 1999 to 2003
needed
amount in relative terms
Many people in the United Kingdom are very worried about what happens to consumers when the euro arrives
Is it going to be like the change to decimal currency - a rip-off
International cooperation between the various consumer interest groups is also important given the global market that now operates across virtually all sectors
Finally , this Parliament has a duty to ensure that consumers are properly informed , educated and protected
The implementation of this report will help to do that and I congratulate Mr Whitehead on bringing it in
Madam President , we in the Green Group were very concerned at the Court's decision to freeze the budget line for consumer activities
What we in fact wanted was for these activities to be expanded and more resources to be allocated
For us that is the crucial point
We support the Commission proposal
However , we believe it is most important that resources are made available not just to the classic consumer organisations but also to the NGOs
May I remind you that in the Federal Republic very considerable resources are spent on an advertising campaign to promote meat as a vital energy source
But there we are talking about marketing companies , which must not be confused with consumer organisations
So the aim must be genuinely to strengthen the consumer organisations , which also means that key consumer protection organisations must receive funding from that budget line
But this must not lead to funds being diverted from , for instance , the action programme concerning environment-related diseases or from activities in favour of consumers
So we consider it most important that key consumer organisations also benefit from these resources
The money really must be used to inform the consumer and not to market certain products in the European Union to the benefit of industry
The consumers need these resources , because they have a great need for information
Madam President , I remember the report on priorities in consumer policy for 1996 to 1998
The rapporteur at the time warned the Commission not to move too fast , yet now that is exactly what he himself is doing
He is not just calling for more funding , but also for more policy areas to include consumer activities
I feel that the Commission document is more in tune with the limited opportunities open to consumer policy at European level
The proposal to extend consumer activities to all areas of policy seems completely unrealistic
in with the next action programme
policy , and some scope must be left for dealing with unexpected consumer problems
supporting measures taken by the consumer protection organisations
This brings me to my final point
I welcome the shift in consumer policy which the establishment of this general framework represents
We will no longer just be drafting regulations , but will actually be working to strengthen the position of consumers
Consumer protection begins with the consumers themselves
Strong consumer representation improves the operation of the market , while statutory regulations simply disrupt it
In conclusion , it is not the quantity of measures to benefit consumers that needs to be improved , but their quality
safety and quality of foods
I think it is a good report that touches on some important questions
is only suspected that humans can be adversely affected by a food
We should now devise rules to reduce the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry
I believe that stable and firm rules create consumer confidence , as does labelling which provides sound information to the consumer
proposing
I trust that the Commission has done its homework here and has got the right results
In addition , I think that measures of a different kind are as effective in this area as central increases in budget appropriations
I have a feeling that politicians sometimes tend to adopt measures which are not entirely necessary
I do not think that we politicians should underestimate the civic forces in society
Consumers themselves have a major responsibility
Perhaps we politicians are inclined to say that it is we who must solve their problems
In the long run , this can lull consumers into a false sense of security
the necessary decisions
A consequence of this will be that producers become more attentive to consumers' demands
be brought into focus
into account in the context of the EU's other policies and activities
agricultural policy , competition , financial services and , last but certainly not least , the EU's food policy
Apart from that I think it extremely regrettable that the Commission proposal limits support to 50 %
This rule makes it impossible for many smaller consumers' organisations to take part in projects , because they simply cannot afford to pay the remainder themselves
Also consumers' organisations in the smaller countries , including the Consumers' Advisory Council in Denmark , have problems with this form of financing
The EU should pursue consumer policy in such a way that it is actually feasible , for smaller consumers' organisations too , to take part in projects
The financial resources of the organisations are tied up in wages and other administrative costs
the EU needs reliable consumers' organisations , indeed organisations like the Danish Consumers' Advisory Council , to take charge of these campaigns
but not necessarily a priority for the consumers' organisations
the organisations to take part in these EU projects
EU currently only pays half price for that credibility
interests
I wholeheartedly support the report
or the internal market , to use a more agreeable term , given that we are dealing with consumers
up with the winds of change sweeping through the consumerist world
whereby consumers are the protagonists in all public and private activities
Consumers first
demands modern and efficient services; in other words , more assurances all round
These consumers move around more , wish to broaden their horizons and want to make better use of their time
Community-wide , spanning all the EU countries
The major innovation in this whole scenario is the advent of the euro
Day one of the new single currency , which will revolutionise purchasing habits and consumer patterns , is 1 January 1999
citizens
for consumers within the new monetary system
Their interests are the focus of our day-to-day efforts
Madam President , over the past decade the Union has considerably stepped up its consumer policy , especially since the entry into force of the Treaty on European Union
Further developments in respect of consumer policy and health protection are provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty
I very much agree with all those speakers this evening who have remarked , albeit in differing terms , that consumers are the protagonists of the European single market
This proposal outlines the legal framework for activities eligible for Community funding under the policy relating to consumers and health protection
For decades now , actions undertaken in the name of EU consumer policy have been financed through the Community budget
the references contained in Article 129a , introduced into the EC Treaty in 1992
adequately protected in the new enlarged single market - and that market is taken a stage further with the single currency
Consumers' interests must be taken into account in the same way as those of the other economic players
This general framework should not be confused with a multiannual action programme
protection
By the end of the year , the Commission is to present a programme outlining its priorities for the years 1999 to 2001
This programme will explain the actions which the Commission intends to undertake over the next three years
The decision now under discussion constitutes the legal base for financing the activities set out in the priority programme
our activities in the field of consumer policy and health protection would have to be suspended
Parliament's internal procedures , making it likely that a decision will be reached by the end of the year
rights
broadly sympathise - are too general and sweeping in the Commission's opinion; therefore they cannot be accepted in their present form
Amsterdam Treaty for consumer policy
on this matter
the Treaty's entry into force
We are currently at the stage of the first reading , and the Council is to announce its position on this proposal on 3 November
for Community funding
The Commission will do all it can to enable Parliament and the Council to reach their decision at second reading by the end of this year
which I referred is drawn up
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
Conditional access services
with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Directive on legal protection of services based on , or consisting of , conditional access (Rapporteur: Mr Anastassopoulos)
that , with the Council's acceptance of our two amendments , it will at last become possible for this directive to be approved in the near future
That will enable us in the European Union to do something more effective and more coordinated about a pirate activity which represents a real threat
The illicit decoders produced by the pirate industry are estimated to account for perhaps as many as 20 % of all decoders
income comes from that source
to give us a picture of the extent of illicit activities in this sector
communication to facilitate trade
They create consumer protection problems and weaken the protection provided by agencies dealing with intellectual property rights
has always managed to adapt at lightning speed and neutralise any protection system with even more advanced techniques
The only thing left , therefore , was a Community approach to the problem involving harmonisation of the rules protecting services based on , or consisting of the provision of conditional access
ceased to flourish
by , a period which can certainly be regarded as brief in the context of Community procedures
My second report on the draft directive , which was approved by a very large majority on 30 April 1998 by the House , included 24 amendments
In its amended proposal , the Commission accepted 18 of these in whole or in part , and the Council has essentially followed suit
The result is that we have before us a common position adopted by the Council whose text has several improvements compared with the original text
The definitions have been reworked and have become much clearer
A new Article 1 clarifies the directive's scope
the Council
These important elements , however much they satisfied your rapporteur , were nevertheless unable to offset the refusal by the Commission and the Council to extend the directive's scope
just ensuring remuneration for their provision
However , the Commission and the Council insisted on limiting themselves to that last point alone
extend legal protection to services which use conditional access for purposes beyond just securing remuneration
first reading
always provided that just the two amendments which go together with the recommendation for second reading are accepted , so that the final draft directive can be approved quickly
Madam President , our hope is that even though the Council and the Commission have restricted its scope , the directive will help to deal more effectively with decoder piracy
In that hope , I have the honour to submit this recommendation for second reading to the House
effectively
has been approved
The directive is a genuine one in that it does not contain provisions of a regulatory nature
It leaves Member States sufficient leeway to develop legislation either through criminal law or simply through civil responsibility , which to me seems quite reasonable
The directive is also noteworthy because of the comprehensive way in which it deals with the issue
should any inadequacies be detected
general need for each state to protect services that are remunerated
very keen to collaborate
I think that Parliament will be able to approve the text tomorrow with the amendments tabled by the rapporteur , and a step forward will therefore be taken
private activities that effectively enable this information to be transmitted
I believe that Community law will soon be developed by Member States and that this matter will thus be dealt with without many difficulties
Party
I think that by accepting the sensible and well-reasoned amendments that were tabled , this directive has satisfactorily concluded a very complicated issue in a very short space of time
This success has undoubtedly been achieved thanks to the combination of the rapporteur's rigour and skillful negotiating
As far as the issue itself is concerned , the proposal for a directive covers a wide range of interactive broadcasting services , independently from the method of transmission used
which is currently booming , as the rapporteur pointed out - that manufactures and markets the devices that facilitate unauthorized access to these services
service providers but also in terms of the economic damage it causes to conditional-access and content providers
buys is from and is also led to believe that the device being bought is an authorized one
The discrepancies between our legal systems have very serious and negative implications for the development of these services and also - as the rapporteur mentioned - for the internal market
important one - of technological piracy
It is a facet that , through technical devices , facilitates access to encrypted services without paying the legal established fee
This characterises the directive's field of application , its very structure and its purpose
It does not aim to protect access to any type of distant encrypted service
of this conditional access
between the Commission and Parliament
interest alongside the concept of remuneration
of its effectiveness since its precepts would have to be defined in very general terms in order to respond to very different situations
also protected by European legislation as soon as possible
affects them economically
This therefore resolves one of the controversies that has plagued these proceedings and , to a large extent , justifies Amendment No 2 by the Committee on Legal Affairs
This was voted for unanimously at the suggestion of the rapporteur , insofar as it expresses concern regarding follow-up work , so effectively led by the rapporteur himself
as co-legislator , but also because it offers substantial improvements from a technical and objective point of view
The rapporteur referred to the clearer definition of Article 1 but , in terms of clarity , it is worth studying the strengthened definitions in Article 2
that are brought to prosecution and those liable for prosecution
In addition , punishments are being better adapted in their current form to the different national legal systems
devices from commercial circles
system
Lastly , the new recital includes the element of intent , which enables national legislation to prosecute the perpetrators of illicit activities who can be shown to have had fraudulent intent
any form of subjectivity
To sum up , this directive is important in that it does fill a gap , albeit partially
For us , it is a stage in implementing wider legal protection
The ball is now in the Commission's court
Let us hope it acts soon
Madam President , Commissioner , it could be said that in this Chamber we are 'cryptic correspondents' , who go in for coded messages
I do not know what I am now expecting from the interpreters
To begin with , I regret that we have not taken up the amendment that was discussed in the Legal Affairs Committee
What we wanted to secure by that amendment was that anything deliberately devised in order to circumvent this protection should have been made subject to criminal sanction
I regret that this has not brought into the plenary debate
Spanish Government that persists in fragmenting the market in encryption products
I have already taken up this question with Commissioner Monti
I am very sad that we are not achieving progress , indeed we seem to be moving backwards as regards encryption in other sectors
the Treaty of Amsterdam
in examining this important and complex proposal
I also wish personally to compliment the rapporteur , who obviously has a thorough knowledge of the subject as well as great political sensitivity
As a result , I hope that the directive will be adopted and implemented very soon
I would refer in particular to the withdrawal of the main amendment put forward at first reading , seeking to extend the scope of the proposal
than that of ensuring remuneration , and to take into consideration the legal and economic implications for the single market and the need to introduce appropriate legal protection
relevant contract are now in their final phase
in the light of technical and economic developments
incorporated into the Commission's modified proposal but rejected by the Council
I note with satisfaction the rewording of this amendment , and can tell you that the Commission is happy to accept it
conclusions and , in its turn , adopt the revised text
our two institutions
Thank you , Mr Monti
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
Recognition of qualifications
liberalization and transitional measures and supplementing the general systems for the recognition of qualifications (Rapporteur: Mrs Gebhardt)
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner Monti , first let me thank all those colleagues who helped me to draft this report
to the common position
That document concerns the mechanism for the recognition of qualifications in commerce and industry
Member State
I regard this as an unnecessary bureaucratic imposition
The Legal Affairs Committee agrees with me that it should be left to the applicant to choose the mechanism for providing evidence of adequate knowledge and skills
There are sound reasons for this
requirements
So he should also be able to decide for himself whether to sit an aptitude test or to attend an adaptation period
He must not be burdened with the demands of a bureaucracy that he may find quite alien
After all , we are trying to dismantle rather than build up obstacles
Applicants were given this choice in the first two horizontal directives on the recognition of diplomas
It is important and necessary for the coherence and transparency of European legislation to adopt a corresponding rule for the third horizontal directive we are discussing here
To that end we must amend the common position , and I do not think we will find that particularly hard to do
I assume that not many more monitors will be turned on in Members' offices at this time of night than there are Members present here in plenary
But it would be wrong to take that to mean that we are merely killing time on a trivial matter
The directive on recognition in the field of commerce and industry is in fact a highly important one
I can give you one figure to demonstrate this
We are turning 35 liberalisation and transitional directives that have come into being over the years into one single one
When it enters into force , 35 earlier laws will suddenly lapse
That is what I see as the consolidation of European legislation
It creates more transparency , even if the layman would probably find his head spinning at the sight of this document
That should not necessarily be the case
If we really want to come closer to the people , we must strive in future to make our texts more readable
Otherwise even a minimum of legislation will frighten people off
I cite my own amendment as a bad example
It is four sentences long , but only amends one point of the common position
The German version of the draft amendment consists of no less than 36 lines , and even the first sentence is an endless 82 words long
The second achieves a proud count of 50 and the third a mere 30
By comparison , when journalists had to measure their dispatches in words , 500 words represented a full-scale report on an important event far away
Or look at the Ten Commandments
They say much in few words
That is not because Moses was lazy , did not have a computer and had to engrave it all laboriously in stone - it is a simply a well-drafted text
So much for the ugly facade of the directive on recognition , which is designed to sweep away 35 old rulings in order to create greater clarity and legal certainty
I think that is most important
Others could say the directive is an industrious piece of work , a successful technical repair job on the legislation and no more than that
But it is more than that
In fact this directive is much more - if we take a serious look at it
It helps to implement an important civil right in the European Union , the right to freedom of movement
Remember , it is only since Maastricht that civil rights have become a part of the Treaties on which our European Union is based
They are basic rights , although they are not drafted in particularly lavish terms
subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in this Treaty
This could be termed conditional freedom of movement on paper
The present directive creates an area of genuine freedom of movement that is recoverable by law
For surely the truth is this: freedom of movement has to mean freedom to reside and work in the place of one's choice
We have made a beginning with two other directives , now we are giving the green light to activities in commerce and industry
Bureaucratic obstacles have been removed and the proposed amendment will ensure the necessary fair treatment
That is how the road looks that runs from civil rights on paper to living reality
The recognition of diplomas is a big step along that road
It not only loosens the bonds restricting young people in the exercise of their profession , but is also an important means of combating the scourge of unemployment in Europe
Why
Because by guaranteeing professional freedom of movement we can counter what is often an unfair distribution of work
After all , we all know about the complaints of numerous sectors that could offer enough jobs in certain regions , but cannot find suitable workers
And then there will be the young person who does not dare to learn the trade of his dreams because it is not needed in his particular region
The freedom of establishment guaranteed by the directive we will vote on tomorrow will ensure the necessary labour mobility
This is not just an economic necessity , but for many who love their work it is also a matter of personal happiness
I cannot imagine doing a better political service to our citizens than helping to fulfil their wishes and dreams
Now that we are completing economic and monetary union with the introduction of the euro , we can turn our eyes to the people of Europe and their rights
It is up to us to breathe life into citizens' rights
I believe that looked at from that perspective we can see the true importance of the recognition directive
But it must not remain an isolated one
There are many ways of making Europe useful to its people through citizens' rights
Just a few months ago we adopted a whole range of measures with the De Clercq report
Let us implement them
In conclusion , let me clear up an imprecision in the wording of the amendment
In some languages , the term 'beneficiary' crept in instead of 'applicant'
Only the word 'applicant' makes sense and corresponds to the word 'demandeur ' which I chose in the original French text
I would ask for this to be corrected in all the language versions
obtained in their Member State of origin
Glassopoulo ruling
and to carry out some helpful simplification
The Commission and the Council have accepted the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading
The Council has moreover put forward some highly commendable modifications , such as the easing of the criteria concerning the length of training , giving priority to practical experience
the professional diplomas and qualifications acquired in other Member States and the skills required under its own national regulations
If there is equivalence , recognition must be granted
The host Member State must complete this procedure within eight months of receiving the application
Legal action may be taken if the application is rejected
the additional knowledge through an updating course or an aptitude test
The only outstanding point at issue between Parliament and the Council of Ministers concerns the responsibility for choosing between a course and an aptitude test
decided unanimously - and quite rightly , in my opinion - that the choice should be left up to the migrant worker
right to choose between an adaptation period and an aptitude test
Another important aspect is the procedure for updating Annex A of the directive
would merit a legislative procedure can often sneak into annexes
will be adopted very shortly in its final form
legal protection
People seeking the recognition of qualifications should , however , be allowed to choose a method themselves by which they can show their qualifications: either through application tests or adaptation periods
I too hope , as has been said already , that the Council will adopt this amendment by the rapporteur
The result would thus match the existing practice in the horizontal directives
The whole area of reciprocal recognition of examinations and qualifications is a vital one in the practical development of European cooperation
for them to acquire experience alongside their studies , as well as developing a facility for European cooperation
For example , the Socrates and Leonardo programmes , which are at present being reorganised , are good tools for reciprocal understanding and for the development of European awareness
State
One problem is still a lack of knowledge of the workings of the common system for recognition and the possibility of an appeal
We have to develop ways of spreading information on working conditions and vacant posts through the Eures network
Furthermore , the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training does much good work for the reciprocal recognition of professional qualifications
action needed , on the basis of a comparative study and the progress made
Madam President , I have a good deal of sympathy for one remark made by the rapporteur , Mrs Gebhardt
is extremely important
terms of enhancing the freedom of individual citizens , especially in an economic and monetary union
It is vital in an economic and monetary union that labour should enjoy a high degree of mobility
lose it - but at least we can and must minimise man-made obstacles , including all the difficulties which this directive seeks to overcome
I am pleased that this House is able to approve the Council's common position almost in its entirety
I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Gebhardt , and the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights for their constructive attitude
of movement for workers

an area where it is so difficult to come up with effective , straightforward measures
Here we have one
Thank you , Mr Monti

The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
Court of First Instance
The next item is the report (A4-0290/98) by Mr David W
of the European Communities to enable it to give decisions in cases when constituted by a single Judge (6290/97 - C4-0218/97-97/0908(CNS))
Madam President , the Court of First Instance was created in 1988 and first heard cases in 1989
The reason for its creation was that the Court of Justice itself could no longer cope with its case load
The reality is that the Court of First Instance only had to deal with 55 cases in 1989 and in 1997 it had 624
Although 624 cases is a considerable number , it should have been possible for the Court of First Instance to deal with these efficiently
Unfortunately , the backlog at the end of 1997 was 1 106 cases
So we have a crisis
Clearly the Court of First Instance cannot cope with its workload and delayed justice often impacts on the quality of justice
We are anticipating a further increase in the workload of the Court of First Instance when appeals against the trademark decisions start to feed their way into the system
The Court is naturally and rightly looking at ways to speed up the rate at which it handles cases
by chambers of three or five judges
abstaining
Eventually we voted again and the committee agreed to support the proposal
Briefly , the arguments against the proposal were that by moving towards the system of having a single judge , we would undermine the multinational nature of the Court
Many members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights felt that it was important that different legal systems and different legal cultures were expressed in any judgment
There was also a danger that a judgment would be identified with a nationality
decision
So it was felt that to be able to identify the nationality of a judge might start to weaken the confidence of the general public in the Court
Other members felt this was a false argument , that we were part of a European-wide organisation and we should have confidence in any judge no matter what nationality
of First Instance handles cases
Although it would not save us much time as the Court claimed , we felt that having a single judge would save some time
Perhaps 10 % more cases a year could be handled
the problems that the Court of Justice and Court of First Instance face in terms of handling their workload
structures in the Court , moving towards the use of specialised Chambers to speed up cases and even reconsidering at a future IGC the powers of the Court of First Instance
For example , should staff cases be a Court matter
Would it not be better to find a tribunal to handle staff cases
These cases take up a considerable proportion of the Court's work
not be the long-term solution to the Court of First Instance's problems
Probably at an Intergovernmental Conference - but certainly at some sort of forum in the future - we are going to have to come back to this issue
reservations that I shall come back to later
report has been conducted
to presenting a report on the amendment of Article 2(4) of the Council Decision
In other words , neither Parliament nor indeed the Commission have any institutional competence to give an opinion on the amendment of its Rules of Procedure
this body may be called to give a verdict in a specific case
Council
Ladies and gentlemen , there can be no more trust than that
Let us now turn to one of the arguments outlined by the rapporteur
number of cases handled will increase by 10 % , without any increase in costs
A constant concern of this Parliament is to get the maximum return from every Community ecu that is spent , and in this respect we are pleased with the proposal
the body
And as the rapporteur has already said: late justice is not justice at all
The Court's legitimacy will be strengthened as the time taken to handle each case is reduced
This is certainly true
But justice still has to be administered if the Court is to be strengthened
Lastly , a vote in favour of the proposal tomorrow will prove that the House has confidence in the ability and equanimity of the Court with a single judge
cases
The vast majority of the Group of the European People's Party will therefore vote in favour of the proposal
majority
handled by between 5 % and 10 % is nothing more than a makeshift solution
Because of the way the institutions operate , it will also prevent this issue from being dealt with decisively in the near future
And , given the institutions' heavy workload , let us not forget that it will be difficult to 'come back' to the issue
According to the judges already mentioned , 150 appeals at the end of the year from Alicante would lead to a serious crisis
Well , ladies and gentlemen , I do not want to be a prophet of doom , but a crisis appears to be the inevitable outcome of this solution
However , the reservations held by those such as myself are not only of a practical and temporary nature , but also stem from concerns relating to substance
The rapporteur spoke of pluralism
It is true that cultural pluralism and the pluralism of legal heritage form one of the foundations of European legal integration
And this is particularly true in terms of the Court of Justice
the construction of Europe , would receive wider public acceptance
And , Madam President , if justice comes from the people , then the people should perceive it as such
very different , diverse and disparate experiences
already said , neither Parliament nor the Commission would be anything more than powerless witnesses - might increase the number of cases in which a single judge could be used
cost - that it would inevitably also entail
Madam President , this issue therefore needs careful consideration
Further to the solutions put forward by the rapporteur , I would like to add that of the review of certain privileges for officials in relation to costs
of law
Because Europe will either have its own body of law or it will not
Madam President , we really have an odd situation here: all three of us who have spoken so far , including myself , are actually against the proposal
We also have a situation in which the legal services of all three institutions find , for somewhat different reasons , that the proposal is not desirable
My impression is that the core of their argument relates , firstly , to confidence in Community law and , secondly , to the fact that the problems of effectiveness are not solved
It is precisely this point , the effectiveness problems remaining unsolved , that previous speakers have been addressing
The key issue for me is to uphold the principle of collegiality in decision-making
Collegiality needs to be maintained when difficult decisions are to be taken
I think we must now take a serious look at the situation as regards the defence of the Community justice system
directly for citizens
We see many attacks of this type on Community justice , which is nevertheless what holds our legal system and our EU together
We must , however , look very seriously at the need to have courts that function in such a way that citizens can have confidence in them
The essence of this is the collegiate system
as possible in Vienna , but at least when the mini-IGC begins
rule of law , which the EU is
I will merely say in conclusion that a large section of the Liberal Group will vote against the proposal
the Committee on Institutional Affairs has decided to do so too
My reasons are these
The initiative for the new ruling comes from the Court itself , which set out its views in some detail in the Legal Affairs Committee
The new rules can only be applied after a Chamber decision , i
e
only on the basis of a Chamber decision
Their scope is so carefully circumscribed that there is no risk of legal uncertainty
These new rules on single judge decisions cannot be replaced by any other potential proposals with regard to the composition of the Court of Justice
itself for tasks on a quite different scale , not least with regard to its jurisdiction , in view of the forthcoming accession of the Central and Eastern European countries
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Court of First Instance is faced with an enormous workload
The deepening of European integration and the simultaneous realisation by citizens of their rights under Community law are adding to this workload
The effect on the average length of lawsuits has been inevitable: it has now reached 29
3 months
trade mark
The procedures and structures therefore need to be altered , so as to clear the backlog and enable the CFI to cope with the increase in litigation
The proposal is to entrust a single judge with certain less important , repetitive cases , such as staff appeals
There would , however , be no change to the principle whereby the CFI sits in chambers composed of three or five judges
in every case by the chamber comprising three judges
The changes to the Rules of Procedure which have been submitted to the Council of Ministers provide for an important set of limitations and restrictions
The resulting legal framework would have a beneficial effect on the length of proceedings , without making Community jurisdiction any less authoritative
into force
fundamental initiatives , which will of course require more detailed examination and more time
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , the Commission expressed its view on the issue of the single judge in the opinion forwarded to you last June
Court of Justice are broadly similar
Indeed , how could we fail to sympathise with the concerns expressed by the ECJ and CFI
for the building of Europe will be compromised
Judges must therefore be given the means to work efficiently
Nevertheless , the dilemma is this: is the single judge the most suitable means
trade marks , I have grave doubts
Indeed , according to the proposed criteria , delegation to a single judge will only be possible after a number of years , once an established body of case law already exists
I would stress - the huge increase anticipated in 1997 has so far failed to materialise , meaning that its complexity cannot yet be assessed
Perhaps it might be wiser to think in terms of a chamber specialising in all fields of intellectual property , rather than a single judge system
Referring to the statistics submitted by the Court , including its sentencing rate , I am convinced that what is urgently needed is something else
minor ones , following an investigation of the case by the chamber
Undoubtedly , and the Commission has taken this into account , when reading these statistics one is bound to conclude that no request for help , however modest , should be neglected
introduction of a single judge into the Community's legal system
The Commission has voiced many doubts in this regard
as a means of coping with an increase in lawsuits
which basically only require the application of the principles of so-called 'pilot' rulings
Such cases could undoubtedly be left to the discretion of a single judge , but the texts proposed by the ECJ and CFI go much further
judge
Commission's view be regarded as minor
criteria , would be judged by the chamber and the judge-rapporteur to be not particularly complex
In the Commission's view , the proposed system should under no circumstances be approved in its present form
without further reflection , the principle of the single judge as a normal operating method of the Court of First Instance in the future
And this is precisely the point here
extend the competence of the single judge , simply by modifying its Rules of Procedure , in order to cope with its burden of work
system as a whole
in the field of asylum and immigration , fields which by their very nature lend themselves to a fair number of disputes
in order to determine what reforms are needed prior to the forthcoming enlargement
Thank you , Mr Monti
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
(The sitting was closed at 11

)
I would also ask you to bear in mind that New York was once one of the most dangerous cities in the world , and within a short space of time
Mr President , if the Austrians are starting to defend Strasbourg and attack Brussels , and if the Bureau is dealing with the matter and the Quaestors are starting to get involved ,
But I would point out that one of the three flights from the Netherlands to Strasbourg has now been dropped , making Strasbourg even more difficult to get to , so
Mr Wijsenbeek , you are enough of an old hand in this House , and for years we have become used to hearing comments about that sort of thing from you , and
Mr President , I should like to mention , in reference to the last comment , that there is not a single direct flight from Finland to Strasbourg , so I suggest we meet
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the European Conference of 6 October 1998 in Luxembourg , including the current situation in Malta in connection
As well as the 15 EU Member States and the Commission , the 11 applicant countries - the 10 Central and Eastern European countries and Cyprus - and the Swiss
The presidency thus tried to cover a wide range of business and , with the exception of the subject of competitive economies , actually tried to contribute something on all the
This group of experts , known as the COLD Group , was set up by the London European Conference in March of this year and held its first meeting on 10
The danger posed to our society by international networks of criminals should not , after all , be underestimated , since they have now infiltrated many different areas of human life -
In the discussion on preventing and combating the sexual exploitation of children , the Conference participants agreed that protecting children , who are both the weakest members of society and the
source of our hopes for the future , needs to be a particular priority of the international community , because , as well as being exploited economically and persecuted in times of war ,
Fighting paedophilia , and related evils such as sex tourism and child prostitution , on the one hand , and taking action to prevent child abuse within the family and the production
and distribution of child pornography , above all on the Internet , on the other hand , therefore present a very particular challenge , not only to the Member States of the European Union ,
The presidency referred to the European Union's intensive work in this area in recent weeks and months , giving an overview of the various activities being undertaken in that field and
From the EU's activities , the presidency singled out , in particular , the joint action to combat trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children , which the Council adopted
A number of the participating states reported on their experience of working in this field to the Conference and , at the end of the discussion , the participants agreed to invite
the European Conference group of experts on drugs and organised crime to examine in detail , which of the EU's legal instruments the European Conference partner countries might be able to
The various representatives reported on their involvement in environmental initiatives , through European regional organisations: the Central European Initiative; the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Group; the Council of Baltic Sea
For the future , they agreed that , as a first step , the presidency would invite the various bodies responsible for regional cooperation , along with the European Commission and the Environment
Over lunch , we discussed two further topics , developments in Kosovo and the situation in Albania , but I do not wish to address these now , because they will be the subject
Mr President , with reference to yesterday's European Conference in Luxembourg , I would just like to say how much I welcomed the fact that the presidency decided to include on the
The fight against organised crime , the sexual exploitation of children and illegal immigration are all presently at the top of our political agenda , and we therefore feel that it
I think that once the Amsterdam Treaty has been ratified we will have a number of new instruments to make transnational cooperation more effective , including with the new Member
We all know that the Maltese Government has reactivated its application to join the European Union , which it withdrew , or rather postponed , two years ago , and has resubmitted it
What this means in this particular case is that the Commission must now examine what effect the two-year gap in preparations for membership has had on Malta's current political
We have therefore told the Council that we will be updating the opinion delivered on Malta in 1993 , and that we will be delivering a new opinion on how
The Council sets great store by having extremely detailed information , which means that we are having to work through the 1993 opinion and compare it with the current situation
Finally , as I do not need to tell you , when I was in New York I had the opportunity to talk to Guido Di Marco , Malta's new and also former
I also said that the Council is definitely expecting Malta to try to make this application a bipartisan matter , that everyone knows that the application withdrawn two years ago
when the present opposition party came to power has been reactivated , and that the Member States are delighted that the people of Malta are so keen to become part of
The minister told me that that was also certainly the intention of his government , and that as the integration process progresses it will also become easier to convince more
A second point was that the question of introducing a system of VAT in Malta was extremely important last time round and was even one of the main reasons why
I also endorse the words of the Commissioner , who said that it is important to address those issues which are of particular interest to people , which give them cause
Firstly , I believe - and this is something of which the House should be aware - that the way we chose to deal with the applicant countries , using the
The elections in Latvia - as well as the referendum on integrating the Russian-speaking population - and the elections in Slovakia have shown that it was right to accept
But if Turkey is not capable of solving the problem itself by peaceful means , then it has neither the legitimacy nor the right to take action and organise activities
I should like to ask the presidency whether this was discussed; what the presidency's views are on this issue; and whether , perhaps jointly with the Americans , a clear statement could
My final question for the presidency , however , is whether an initiative was put forward at the meeting of foreign ministers in Salzburg to extend this project to embrace other countries ,
The initiative did not exactly meet with enthusiasm or approval , but in principle , I believe it is the right approach , even though it was perhaps not prepared as well
The topics discussed , quite rightly , at the European Conference , relate to problems which can ultimately only be solved if , at the very least , the countries of south-east Europe and
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have the impression that the topic of Malta came as rather a surprise , not only to you , Commissioner van den Broek , but also to
Admittedly , I had expected a rather clearer signal from the Council , given the remarks the Commission made in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Security , which were , even at
Indeed , perhaps it is also the Council that should take some responsibility for the somewhat confused situation , because it gave Malta the brush-off and said that its turn would
The intention of our motion for a resolution is to call on the Council to send out a clear and immediate signal , first of all , to indicate that it welcomes
Mr President , I welcome the report we have heard in the Conference; the sensitive way in which it has dealt with dossiers such as crime , sexual exploitation and illegal immigration
I would like to use the opportunity of this debate to slightly broaden the focus , because also this week we had the important news that on 10 November next we
Now that we have crossed the threshold with the five plus one States for November , we must add new vigour to the search for the institutional reform of our
But this , too , must add a new urgency for the Council and the Commission in respect of an EU-led political initiative to resolve the Cyprus problem under the aegis
In this regard , I wish to say to the Council that my Group deplores the continued failure by the Council to agree a legal base for a financial protocol with
Mr President , the election of Mr Adami as the new Prime Minister of Malta is going to have the effect of reactivating the application of Malta to join the European
He recently stated that there would be two objectives for his new government: firstly , the application of Malta to join the European Union; and secondly , the repairing of the
Both these issues are interlinked to a small extent , particularly in the context of economic criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty which prospective participants in the European Union must
The revival of the Maltese application to join the European Union will ensure that it is dealt with in the context of the next round of enlargement negotiations , in
In fact the issue of Malta joining the European Union will be discussed at the November summit and the benefits of joining the Union for the 370 000 inhabitants of
The European Union with its internal market and free movement of goods , persons , services and capital is a positive economic prospect for a country which is seeking to find more
This Parliament did not wish the European Conference to be left to drift along as a kind of token event , but wanted to enhance its status and make it
However , it still lacks a coherent strategy , and has not developed into a pan-European body , capable of meeting ecological and social needs and fulfilling this continent's hopes for stability
A failed and internationally highly dubious European migration policy , which has manifested itself in some astounding ways , in particular under the Austrian Presidency , cannot be boiled down to the problem
I hope that the Council will now also succeed in developing joint programmes and , when the money is distributed between the regions , that it will not differentiate between them
I am delighted that Parliament agreed to the request made by my group , the Group of the European Radical Alliance , to have the relaunching of Malta's application to join the
It goes without saying that our delegation has always shown the greatest respect for the positions expressed by the various governments , since the will of the people must always
However , I am not going to hide the fact that I have always felt that deep down the Maltese people have had a real desire to share with the other
I would point out that , in accordance with Article 2 of the Protocol on the Institutions in the Treaty of Amsterdam , the process of institutional reform is automatically initiated
Mr President , when examining Malta's application for membership , which the Commissioner has confirmed has been resurrected , the Union must , I believe , take into account the following points in particular: firstly ,
While other Member States are obliged to have a minimum rate of 15 % , a derogation clause on this point would put this country , when it accedes , at an
I am very glad that such relevant matters as drugs and child prostitution were debated yesterday , as well as all the other matters that are of concern to us
As Parliament's rapporteur on Malta's accession , I am delighted that Malta was there yesterday at the European Conference and that such a welcome was given to its renewed application for
On behalf of my Group , which also welcomes this renewed request for accession , I wish to say that we also welcome the Maltese Government's decision and indeed the opinion , shared
Our Group also naturally considers it important that the renewed request should be dealt with both expeditiously and in full accordance with the proper procedures laid down in the
My Group has therefore taken the initiative of calling on the Commission to present an updated opinion on Malta's renewed application , and , as Commissioner Van Den Broek has said , to
I was interested to hear what Commissioner Van Den Broek said about the VAT situation being much clearer here , but , as the Commissioner is aware , there were other problems associated
Finally , when we receive the Commission's updated report , I hope we will be able to quickly resolve any outstanding problems , so that the Maltese people can themselves decide once and
His success is all the more significant given that , at the same time , the electorate came out in favour of Malta's accession to the European Union , thus confirming the
The determination and speed with which Prime Minister Adami renewed Malta's application for EU membership , as one of the new government's first acts , should not only reassure us as
Indeed , Malta complies with the criteria for accession to the Union to a much greater extent than other applicant countries , and we can also be sure that a rapid recovery
Once it is fully integrated in the European Union , in my opinion Malta will constitute an important outpost in the Mediterranean basin , likely to form a natural bridge between
Therefore , I can state both out of the conviction deriving from my role as former vice-chairman of the delegation for EU/Malta relations , and for the reasons I have just
Mr President , Madam President-in-Office , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , there has obviously been a communication problem between Parliament , the Council and the Commission , since the Commissioner only realised what was happening
Everyone in Parliament is delighted that Malta has decided to reapply , and I think that politically speaking it is important for the consolidation of the Barcelona process that the
Secondly , I think that it is very important for the people to have the chance to have their say and to distinguish between voting for a party and voting for
Malta is strong enough to protect its own interests , and I think it may also come to illustrate perfectly what Europe has always said about the first and second
It is important to know that the conference is prepared to deal with issues which are important to the ordinary voters of the European Union , such as drugs and
The situation in Europe , quite frankly , is an affront to civilised society; it is an affront to civilisation to have abuse of children and to have , in effect , the
Clearly it would undermine the democratic legitimacy of the European Union if the ordinary voter began to get the impression that the people who most benefited from the freedom of
Madam President-in-Office , I very much welcome the fact that you gave pride of place at the Conference to issues which are without doubt crucial , such as drugs , paedophilia and new
Nevertheless , I cannot refrain from expressing a certain amount of disappointment - which I hope you will be able to dispel in your reply - regarding your silence on
The Commissioner , whom I have heard speak several times in meetings of the joint committee , likewise struck me as rather more lukewarm this time than others , even though we now
Some slippage has occurred over the past two years , it is true , under the Labour Government , as compared with two years ago when Malta met the Maastricht criteria in
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , although I did not mention Malta earlier , because I was not aware that it was included in today's discussion , I would like to say that
You know , of course , that Guido De Marco emerged as the winner in the elections on 10 September , and obviously we took advantage of the first Council meeting after
The Commission - as you know - has been requested to present , as soon as possible , an updated version of its opinion of July 1993 , which , naturally , needs to
In addition , the President of the Council was authorised to send a letter of reply to the Foreign Minister of Malta , referring to the procedure which is now necessary ,
I do believe that we responded as quickly as we could , and I in no way wish it to be understood that we harbour any feelings of resentment against
Obviously , both the European Union and the Council are concerned about the tensions in the region , and at the moment we are supporting Egypt's efforts to restore a certain
On the Partnership for Europe , you are aware that at the informal Council in Salzburg , the Austrian Presidency pursued the idea of finding some kind of basis for bringing
Admittedly , this issue will not be to the fore , but perhaps one or other of the delegations will in fact address the subject of institutional reform , which will , of
On Cyprus , I should like to emphasise once more that we , the Austrian Presidency , are very pleased that we have succeeded in being able to start negotiations on membership with
Obviously , we support starting the negotiations on membership , and hope that this will also have a renewed positive influence on the political negotiating process; in this respect , we are
As far as Turkey is concerned , I should like to point out that the Council presidency is still endeavouring to establish the Association Council with Turkey , and of course here
The Austrian Presidency produced a working paper , which gave rise to a number of misunderstandings , because obviously under no circumstances were we going to do away with the Geneva
She reported that there were an estimated 200 000 refugees and internally displaced people , around 50 000 of whom are spending the night out in the open , in the
In talks with Mrs Ogata , Mr Milosevic even denied the existence of a humanitarian crisis in Kosovo and gave assurances that the Yugoslav Government was endeavouring to ease the
So do the statements made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in the report he presented to the Security Council the day before yesterday , in which he records
There is no doubt - and this needs to be repeated here - that the main responsibility for there being such large numbers of refugees and displaced people lies with
The Serbian and Yugoslav authorities are always claiming that they are , after all , only defending themselves against terrorists and separatists , and that the military offensive is merely a response to
From the political point of view , the Union supports the proposal , drafted by the United States and expressly approved by the Contact Group , for an interim agreement , and sees
The main tasks of the new special envoy will be to coordinate the EU's humanitarian activities with those of the international humanitarian organisations and , at the same time , to act
Revisiting an initiative of foreign ministers Mr Kinkel and Mr V√©drine , the presidency has also set up working groups in Belgrade and Geneva , composed of interested EU states , the USA ,
The aim , by undertaking concerted action agreed on the spot , is to identify villages and towns to which the displaced people , at present living in the open air , can
I refer , in this context , to what happened in places such as Gornje Obrinje , where dozens of innocent people , including in particular elderly people , children and pregnant women , were
At its meeting two days ago , the Council condemned these atrocities and their perpetrators in the strongest possible terms , and called on the Belgrade authorities to investigate these abominable crimes
Besides this , in the light of repeatedly levelled accusations that horrific war crimes were being committed , the presidency has for months been arguing in favour of sending a team
As you know , these consisted of refusing entry visas to security force officials , freezing the overseas assets of the Serbian and Yugoslav Government , banning new investment in Serbia , and
Moreover , there is an EU-wide consensus , that the sanctions should not affect the civilian population or Yugoslavia's neighbouring states , which would themselves be faced with severe difficulties if there
The current mission of the American special envoy , Mr Holbrooke; the consultations in the Security Council on the report tabled by the United Nations Secretary-General; the preparations being made in
NATO for possible air strikes; and the forthcoming meetings of the Contact Group and the North Atlantic Council , should , in the meantime , have made it abundantly clear to Belgrade that
In any case , it is clear to me personally , that Europe and the international community can no longer stand by and watch , while the acts of violence and massacres
It is precisely because hundreds of thousands of people are threatened by a humanitarian catastrophe , that I believe that it is time for clear answers , if the Security Council's
Mr President , I would wholeheartedly endorse the President-in-Office's statement that only a tough response will bring about any change in the terrible situation of hundreds of thousands of refugees and
Our hands are more or less tied , and we have now just about done all we can in the area where the European Union has the power and scope
However , I agree with the President-in-Office that it is rather worrying that it appears to be so difficult to get a package of sanctions approved , and approved in such
I think the necessary measures have now been taken here , but the real sticking point , which has us going round in circles , is whether humanitarian intervention using military means
It is up to the major players to decide whether they agree , and if they cannot reach a consensus , which is the case , then the question is whether to
The thing that strikes me about this whole debate is that there seems to be constant confusion between those who say they want a political solution to the conflict but
exclude any foreign intervention , and those who say they want a political solution to the conflict but that this will not be found unless President Milosevic , who wants a military
A Security Council resolution of 23 September referred to Chapter 7 , which called on the parties to cease hostilities immediately , yet here we are on 7 October and ethnic
I can understand why Russia has reservations about using military intervention , since there is such a thing as Slav solidarity , and the Russian Parliament , which is deeply opposed to
But this can be no excuse for simply allowing a humanitarian disaster to happen , especially given that any new tides of refugees or displaced persons will not be seeking refuge
We can continue to ask questions , but the only answer that counts - how we can put an end to the violence - will remain open until those who
My suspicion is that what people were talking about during this time was simply the harmonisation of a process - a neat bit of packaging around a policy that
Month after month we have heard Members of this European Parliament demanding ever tougher action in Kosovo , and yet we discover in the General Affairs Council that the countries
It is unacceptable to the peoples of Europe to see every day on their television scenes of atrocities and massacres; to see the problems of refugees; to see the
destabilisation of a region of Europe as more and more refugees go into Albania and put more pressure on FYROM , so that the whole region could explode; and to see
We could , therefore , take all the resolutions which we have adopted and adopt them all over again - this time , at last , with the support of the Socialists -
The West did not say it explicitly , but at the beginning , the reality was that they let Milosevic kill in Kosovo because he was said to be crushing the
so-called Kosovo Liberation Army , whose revolt it was which shattered the deathly calm in Kosovo , and at last turned the eyes of the world on this miserable Serbian regime of
The only formula which could provide scope for successful negotiations , mediated by the West , is a temporary international administration in Kosovo , safeguarding the right of the Albanians to live
Unfortunately , however , I fear that Milosevic will then delay the negotiations , that the cat will lead the mouse a terrible dance and that , ultimately , the West will pronounce the mouse
I call upon this Parliament to have the courage of its convictions and to state - even if somewhat late in the day - that the time really has
Mr Gingic said , and I quote , 'If there is an air strike against Serbia the road to Europe will be closed to us , we will fall into a black
We all know that the situation in Kosovo is worsening by the minute , and we are all aware that Milosevic is about to attain his objective and complete his
In this connection , I believe that the European Union should conduct an honest debate amongst its Member States to inform public opinion as to which governments are fully prepared to
The Council must also take into account what Felipe Gonz√°lez , the special envoy , has so often stressed: the solution to the Kosovo problem depends , as do so many other things ,
I tell you , if we are as strong as we are claiming to be , why has Mr R√ºhe - still the German Minister of Defence - who is in favour
It is possible to catch him , but we have not done so , and all of a sudden we are being all pragmatic and wanting to threaten Milosevic with air
I tell you , it is a drastic solution and a drastic situation , but it will not be solved by a Parliament which is so bigoted , that faced with a drastic
That is why I ask you to deliver a strong resolution , but also to conduct a strong policy in your countries , to prevent your government from allowing itself to
Once again , we are ignoring the fundamental problem , which is that as long as there is no democracy in Belgrade , there will be no solution for Kosovo , just as
Mr Milosevic already has his policy , and I think it might be useful to go through it once again: in Bosnia , Mr Milosevic did everything he could , day after day ,
He is prepared to give up the part of Kosovo that cannot be used in exchange for the 40 % or 50 % of the territory which borders on
This is land which includes Kosovo's rich mines , which just by chance happens to be where the few Orthodox monasteries are based , and which , also by chance , would allow
We have adopted a racist approach: we believe that the Serbs have no right to democracy , and we continue , day after day , to condemn them to being governed by
Rather than 'Exocet' or American 'Tomahawk' missiles , there is a much better missile that can work without leading to any bloodshed at all: it is called an 'arrest warrant' ,
The big shots in this Parliament , as well as in the other European institutions , have opted to slow down - or rather to halt - the process of Europe's
We can trot out endless tedious , repetitive resolutions on human rights , and we can emphatically welcome monetary union , but the truth is that , without a political focus , our single currency
will not create a single job for a long time to come , just as we shall go on standing cravenly on the sidelines of atrocities and massacres whose roots are
If we really wished to do our duty , we would all of us together , today , demand that the mandate given to the EU representative in Yugoslavia should be entirely
The massacre of this European people must finally be brought to an end , but only with the intervention of a European Union peace force: it is time to stop
We welcome the fact that NATO is ready to enforce compliance with the UN demands and to enable help to get through to the refugees , because everyone is now talking
We are trying to find a UN-led solution , but as we have often said , the fate of the people of Kosovo must not be allowed to depend on details
Mr President , Madam President-in-Office , Commissioner , what we are seeing in Kosovo is a humiliating display of powerlessness on the part of both the European Union and the international community , embodied
The Amsterdam Treaty , not yet ratified by all the EU Member States , will , in theory , provide a means for us to undertake peace-enforcing , peace-keeping and humanitarian action in the
form of Petersberg missions; the EU will have the option of giving the Western European Union , which would itself have to call on contingents of NATO troops , a mandate to
The dilemma facing the European Union is that it does not have effective security instruments at its disposal , does not have the military backbone , to lend credibility to its demands
It also affects NATO , which has hitherto waited for the green light from the UN Security Council , but which must be aware that this green light to take military
My question to the Council is - and I respect the Austrian Presidency's policy of contributing to the political solution and the effort to avert a humanitarian catastrophe: what will
Austria's position be , as holders of the Council presidency , if NATO , to avoid this crisis of credibility , now intervenes and sends out a military signal , given that there is not
We saw buses full of soldiers - or made out to be full of soldiers - which were said to be leaving Kosovo and returning to Belgrade , like a
Then , here , we have seen a few conversions on the road to Damascus: some who believed until ten days ago that it was possible to do business , to negotiate ,
with Milosevic , and who actually did negotiate with Milosevic , regarding him as a statesman who was vital to the balance of peace - peace , I repeat - in the Balkans;
Given that this House has drawn attention several times to the enormous risk being run , I now ask you all what we intend to do with Milosevic , before or
Milosevic must be hauled before the International Criminal Court; he must no longer receive any support from anyone , and certainly not from ministers , such as the Italian Minister of
Instead of criticising the European Union and the Member States for lack of substantive will , substantive political will for a peaceful solution of the Kosovo problem , we are rebuking
But when have military interventions ever proved to be a solution of any problem to the benefit of the people , which might lead us to think that such an
What we need to do now is to discuss some substantive intervention to find a political solution , if we wish to respect the rights of the people in Kosovo
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as happened in previous conflicts we are once again hearing the same platitudes , the same calls for peace , but also the same threats against those
Everyone supported their communist comrade Milosevic whose army bombed the civil population , razed Vukovar to the ground , massacred injured people in the hospitals and committed all the atrocities with
Rather than wearing themselves down in a terrible war , the Serbs should have , on the one hand , toppled the communist regime and , on the other , turned their attention towards
Muslims , who were previously a minority , now make up 90 % of those who live there thanks to a soaring population , continuous immigration and the collapse of the Serbian
Our governments , which seem to be committed to getting the birth rate down and which open our borders to immigrants from all over the world , would be well advised to
If , in the future , France wanted to keep its sovereignty over a Provence where the majority of the population were Muslims , would it also be threatened with bomb attacks
It is indeed strange that NATO , which was established in 1949 to protect Europe from communism , has never come to the aid of any Europeans invaded by the Red
For in the past , when the Christians in Lebanon were dying in their tens of thousands , when the Chaldean Christian villages were being razed to the ground , or when
I believe that , firstly , the Serbian people should be told that at present , a separate solution to the Kosovo problem and a genuine democratisation of the former Yugoslavia are not
I do not advocate a James Bond-style commando raid to get Mr Milosevic to The Hague , not because I think it would be a bad idea , but because it
It is just not acceptable that , having appointed a special envoy , he should be vetoed by Mr Milosevic for three years , and that during that time , a whole series
Finally , we must urge the Council to support the implementation of the United Nations resolutions - Milosevic understands that language very well indeed - not just to resolve this situation ,
Mr President , as the President-in-Office has made very clear , this so-called political climbdown and withdrawal of troops is a typical tactical ploy by President Milosevic to give the countries of
She also mentioned NATO intervention , and I think it would be a very good idea for Austria to take this opportunity to apply for membership of NATO in order
We also have the impression , as the Commissioner also mentioned , that fear of being inundated with refugees is dominating the decisions and positions being adopted , rather than compassion with
The Justice and Home Affairs Council report of 5 October calmly recommends that we should send migration experts to investigate the causes of the refugee problem in greater detail ,
This is borne out by its failure to enforce sanctions: the ban on flights has simply put money in the pockets of the Yugoslav airlines , there are plenty of
Perhaps this all stems from the fact that parliaments , not just ours but parliaments in general , often have too little influence over what actually happens , and the indignation and
We can see this from the reports issued by the French Parliament , for example , describing how the French Parliament was involved , or rather was actually not involved , in France's
We cannot force anyone to live under a criminal dictatorship , and this is why the regime in Belgrade will ultimately have to change , but for the moment nothing is actually
Indeed , we might wonder why the United States is still militarily involved in the NATO summit in Europe , 50 years after the end of the Second World War and
We want to come to the assistance of a people which is being brutally suppressed , sometimes to the point of death , and whose possessions are being destroyed , by its own
We can only do so , and that should also be clear , by sending assistance to Kosovo , accompanied and protected by ground forces , with two objectives - and we should
The first is to provide large-scale humanitarian aid directly to those on the ground , and the second is to lay the foundations for Milosevic to agree to negotiate with
But surely - and this may not have emerged clearly from the debate - two or three military air strikes will not be enough to change this grave , catastrophic
We have to realise that if we are prepared , as an international community , to act as a protecting power , in much the same way as we did in Bosnia ,
I do not know whether the European Union is aware that this course of action will inevitably mean that NATO , and on the civilian side the European Union , will
If every conceivable effort is made , and still no agreement is reached in this respect , then I believe that we must go to the assistance of the Albanian people
It is quite out of the question for Europe to watch while a people is - I have already expressed it thus - butchered; that is not compatible with
Of course , it must also be clear - I should like to emphasise this here - that this is no licence for the KLA to take action , to a certain
Madam President-in-Office , perhaps you could say a brief word about whether it is agreed , that , in the event of a military intervention , this will not be a short-term operation , but
Mr President , I must say , and I must remind Parliament and the Council and the Commission , that three Balkan countries , one of them a Member State of the Community -
Consequently , I must stress the need for continual and constant communication between the Council and the Commission and those three Member States , which just recently , only ten days ago ,
But the solution to the Kosovo problem is above all else political , and if a military intervention of any sort takes place - I will not go into details ,
because I am not a military man; my only military experience was when I did my national service , so I will leave that to the Council and the Commission -
And I would say that the most important thing to emerge from the harsh resolution we will have to vote upon tomorrow on the Kosovo issue is the message
That nation , which has at present become the instrument of a clique , a military and political establishment in power in Belgrade , must see that there is hope and that
Mr President , Madam President-in-Office , ladies and gentlemen , if the situation were not so tragic , the situation in Kosovo not so dreadful , then people would actually see an amusing side to
If you recall the debate we held on Kosovo in this plenary a month ago , it really is hard to imagine that the great thinkers on foreign policy in
The whole situation has deteriorated significantly , as what we had already observed , in the countries where Milosevic had behaved in the selfsame way in the past , had indicated it
I also have to say that I am astounded to see everyone waiting today , as they did yesterday , for a possible United Nations resolution to bring about some kind
Surely we cannot expect countries such as Russia and China suddenly to change their position , their opinion , on a situation , which closely resembles that in parts of their own
But I believe that first of all , we must repeat that one of the political solutions , which must be at the very top of the list , is that Mr
Even so , experience in Bosnia has shown us that there are situations in which military force - and air strikes , if need be - can be necessary to bring
I expect Russia , in particular , also to make a constructive contribution to bringing the crisis in Kosovo to an end , given the influence which Moscow can exert on Belgrade , and
Discussions in the Alliance involve 11 out of the 15 states , which is why I do not expect the positions of the EU and the transatlantic community to differ
In the light of the constantly changing situation , I thought it would be wrong to make definitive statements one way or the other on this very complex issue today , on
I should , however , like to emphasise once more that - like Mr Swoboda and many other well-known representatives of the European Parliament - I personally believe that the international
I do actually believe that it is quite legitimate to ask whether , in the event of a negotiated solution being implemented , a multinational peace-keeping force on the ground might
For the benefit of those who mentioned Russia's role here , I would just like to repeat what I said at the beginning: I understand Russia's situation , not just the
Slav solidarity aspect , but also the traditional alliance between Russia and Yugoslavia , the position of the Duma , its unwillingness to set a precedent with military action that could be repeated
in its own country , and so on , but I did not mean that Russia should be given the power to veto measures designed solely to end a humanitarian emergency or
Finally , I think that the international community and the European Union now have a duty towards these hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced persons to stop going on about
Most of the Member States of the European Union are also members of NATO and everyone realises that once the violence has stopped and the shockwaves have died down ,
There are more than enough models for such solutions already , but the atmosphere is not ripe for negotiation because there is at least one party that is dominating the
Mr President , in the heat of the debate Mr Cars made some remarks about me which perhaps go slightly beyond the normal rules of debate in this House , although they
It will give the Budgetary Control Committee an opportunity to consider the wording of the amendment and , if necessary , to consult the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights
We have no hesitation in refusing to give discharge for the section on the Economic and Social Committee , yet we are much more indulgent when it comes to our
For a few days , a few weeks even , we have watched amendments being judged inadmissible , even though I am not sure whether our Rules of Procedure provide for the
It is a very sound report that was examined in detail in the committee concerned and adopted by 23 votes for to one against , clear proof that it was
I have no particular problem with this and I think it would be a complete waste of time for the House to refer the whole thing back to the
There is of course the matter that has been raised regarding the two amendments but , even in that connection , I must point out that one of them was rejected
To avoid any misunderstanding of the vote we are about to take , I would just point out that these two amendments have been ruled inadmissible by the President of Parliament ,
Sweden has not been a member of the Union for very long , but already we have seen milk producers deprived of hundreds of thousands of kronas in compensation payments because
The Agreement on wide-ranging scientific and technological cooperation between the USA and the EU , negotiations for which were completed at the end of 1997 , provides a basis for historic technological
It is therefore crucial to bring about ever closer cooperation between different regions of the world , so as to facilitate coordination of research carried out by the most talented
Although it might appear to be a minor matter , this measure is likely to make life easier for the millions of motorists from the European Union who cross its

expanded port state control inspections where conditions are met; -facilitate the operation of ships and craft on specific regular routes which are in compliance and the transfer of such ships
The rapporteur welcomes the initiative which forms part of a raft of measures to improve maritime safety - port state control requirements , registration of passengers , transposition of international maritime safety
In order to draw up his report , our colleague Francis Watts had organised a hearing on the proposal for a directive on conditions for the operation of regular ro-ro ferry
Of 30 European car and passenger ferries , eight were classified as 'deficient' or 'very deficient' on safety features and only five of the 30 ferries were deemed to be
It is therefore understandable that shipowners hardly look favourably on the report by a courageous Member who is fully committed to ensuring greater safety for the hundreds of passengers carried
Our colleague Francis Watts has already been the rapporteur for reports on the safety management of ro-ro passenger vessels and on the registration of persons sailing on board passenger
The 2000 human lives that were lost through the tragedies of the Herald of Free Enterprise , the Scandinavian Star and the Estonia should be sufficient to mobilise all the

Setting out the toughest possible safety standards is in the interests of all of us - travellers , ferry crews and , not least , the ferry operators who need to assure their
As has been stated throughout the debate , the Commission proposal , as amended by some of the amendments introduced by the report , represents a credible working basis in endeavouring to reach
It is essential that objective criteria should be established , once and for all , regarding engine power and tonnage in order to compare capacities and productivity and ascertain (non) compliance with
Other positive developments are the attempt to introduce common definitions and practises with regard to inspection processes and the definition of infringements , while simultaneously seeking to move towards the
These appear to remain in a privileged situation which could continue to give rise to unfair competition and , naturally , suspicion and opposition to the control system by Community fishermen
Moreover , if Community inspectors were to be given broader scope , it would be useful if they could be accompanied by national inspectors , and observers from other Member States should attend
Mr President , as we all know , the report by Mr B√∂sch follows on from Special Report No 8/98 of the Court of Auditors concerning the Commission departments responsible for fighting
In a resolution of 22 October 1997 , the European Parliament had already condemned the shortcomings in the detection of and inquiries into irregularities and fraud , and the absence of
Similarly , we approve of the desire to increase the number of UCLAF staff , particularly those working on investigations , the proposal to establish an Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) to be responsible
However , we regret the fact that the Committee on Budgetary Control did not include our proposal stating that the OLAF director should be appointed jointly by the Council and the
It has been made quite clear once again that the effectiveness of the fight against fraud does not lie in ideological solutions , and we have often been told here
The solution is for Parliament - whose main function it is - to exercise rigorous control over all the Commission's departments and , in particular , financial control , as is its
What is crucial for us is that something should happen , that the fraud unit should be strengthened , so that we are in a better position to combat internal fraud and
It is important to stress that we cannot accept a model that would require an amendment of the Treaty , because that would delay the process for a long , long
Recent revelations of irregularities and corruption within the Commission underscore the need for visibly tougher supervision of activities - managed by the Commission or the Member States - paid
Both the B√∂sch report and the Bontempi report , which was discussed earlier in the week , spotlight the role of the European Parliament in pushing for fresh and stronger action to
The Commission will be making a rod for its own back if it sets about hampering the operation of existing channels of communication with Parliament , thereby obstructing openness and
The B√∂sch report , which follows on from the Special Report of the Court of Auditors on the running of the Commission's Unit for the Coordination of Fraud Prevention (UCLAF) , presents
During the 10 years this unit has existed , it has not managed to finalise its procedural rules , nor to obtain the independence and security in handling information that would
These are three distinct categories that must not be confused - and the Commission is right to underline this - but all three of them are very much in
We have to realise that certain European policies that are supported by Parliament , particularly those involving agricultural refunds or the Structural Funds , generate fraud just as surely as clouds
The result is that Brussels has become submerged in a sea of waste , just like all the institutions that are not controlled and that believe themselves to be above
But until that happens , I have no hesitation in saying that the worshippers of federalism who dominate here , and who want to kill off criticism at any cost , are
Recently , in addition to the articles traditionally devoted to fraud committed at the expense of the Community budget , the press has also mentioned the possibility that wrongful acts might have
The credibility of the institutions and of the construction of Europe obliges us to step up the fight against the fraud undermining the Community budget and the criminal acts committed
I agree with the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control who voted in favour of the report that it is important to improve swiftly the resources the institutions have
And the best way of achieving this is to establish an Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) that is not only independent , but that also has the necessary human and budgetary resources
Three hundred and thirty million pounds of this figure related to the loss of EU receipts and the remainder covered the loss in indirect taxation such as customs and excise
This one example should put into perspective the magnitude of the problem facing the European Union if we are to successfully defeat organised criminal groups who intend to counterfeit the
In light of the fact that EU Member States presently have different structures for preventing and combating counterfeiting , there will be a need for structures for exchanging information between all
The Amsterdam Treaty provisions give more powers to Europol by putting in place coordinated structures between European Union police forces and related law enforcement agencies , so as to ensure that
These new powers are only right and proper in light of the fact that we live in an international market where a free movement of goods , persons , services and
We of course think this is a positive idea , not least in view of the identification by the Court of Auditors of a number of irregularities in UCLAF's present
However , we cannot support the report , because it calls for the control of fraud , corruption and financial irregularities to be dealt with through the establishment of a European criminal
Any further transfer of powers to UCLAF and the appropriation of more financial resources for the recruitment of officials must be undertaken as part of the control of fraud in
The many specific cases of fraud and corruption in the EU system should instead be taken as a basis for: firstly , launching a debate with a view to abolishing
a whole range of the support measures which provide the opportunity for fraud; secondly , introducing greater openness in the system , so that taxpayers and voters can see what their money
Paragraph 4 of Article 280 states that measures in the field of the fight against fraud 'shall not concern the application of national criminal law or the national administration
The fight against fraud at Community level should , however , not be pursued on the basis of conventions and additional protocols which have not been ratified , as is also intimated
The Edinburgh agreement of 1992 states that 'Denmark will participate fully in cooperation on justice and home affairs on the basis of the provisions of Title VI of the Treaty
However , as has also been stated in Denmark's reservation in this area , we will also not stand in the way of others who wish to intensify cooperation in the
That does not alter the fact , however , that the main intention of the resolution is to strengthen the fight against fraud both in the Member States and internally within
If all the EU's documents were to be made public as a matter of principle , and the right to divulge information to the media were safeguarded , then our fraud
The lack of consultation between Parliament and the Commission is mainly due to the fact that when we request information and apply to carry out checks , this is taken
This is because in the Commission , the principle that good management must always - with a few exceptions - be open to public scrutiny , has been turned on its
How do you explain , then , why Parliament did not receive the UCLAF report , or why we only received it when we brought out our biggest guns , namely completely blocking
When there are no transparent and reliable rules; when the Commissioners do not appear to have the courage to take action against cronyism and time-servers in the various Commission
departments; when Commissioners are mixed up with people from the demi-monde ; when Parliament is stalled for months with excuses and 'no comment' , it is not possible to engender trust
If the Commission is not sensitive to this , and does not react accordingly and send out the appropriate signals - and this does not seem likely - then it
Fraud against the Community budget is one of the most serious problems in the 50-year history of European cooperation , both because of the financial loss caused by fraud and -
UCLAF has already accomplished some major tasks since its creation , but it is clear that the lack of judicial cooperation between the Member States has made UCLAF's work considerably
Thus greater independence for UCLAF may be one of the few steps that can be taken at the present time to make the unit more effective in its action
In fact , we have lost count of the number of programmes run by the Commission that , over recent months , have been involved in embezzlement and the misappropriation of very
The work carried out over recent years both by the Court of Auditors and by Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control reveals a world of impenetrability , of cronyism , of connivance and
The B√∂sch report underlines that , for the most part , when an offence is detected , disciplinary procedures are not even initiated and the offences are only referred to the relevant judicial
'The clearing up of an offence is almost deliberately delayed' , and we might wonder whether the Unit for the Coordination of Fraud Prevention (UCLAF) is 'actually being used to
The office he proposes to create will have to work in close cooperation with the European Parliament , one of whose main tasks is to monitor the Commission's activities , particularly
Through the committees of inquiry appointed by the House , we have seen how effective we can be in this field , for example , as regards the way in which the
But in order to stop this tendency on the part of the European institutions to foster large-scale fraud , it is also important to apply the principle of subsidiarity strictly and
The rapporteur highlights , too , the existence of a 'grey area' that can conceal considerable risks of fraud in 'technical' legislation and its countless implementing regulations and provisions , as well as
In this respect , it is typically the case that very often only a small number of officials from the institutions taking part in the decision-making process have an overall
However , we still have some doubt as to whether the projects under the European transport network are financially viable , calling as they do for major investment from both the Member
Its influence must extend beyond the purely financial: it is a major source of knowledge and know-how that must be put to optimum use in order to achieve the
The main concern of the Sis√≥ Cruellas report is that the EU should play a role in strengthening the infrastructure of Eastern and Central Europe as a precondition for trade
The TEN programme , which has been extended to cover Eastern and Central Europe , must however be seen in the light of the political and economic pressure that the EU
The infrastructure projects in Eastern Europe which the EU has supported , for example through PHARE and the European Investment Bank , cater for the interest the big industrial concerns in the
Even the World Bank has gradually realised that major infrastructure programmes intended to bind the centre and peripheral regions together will not by themselves boost economic development in the
On the contrary , it has been shown that the increased exposure of local markets in peripheral regions to competition from the central regions can bring about economic decline in
At the same time , the EIB has maintained an almost completely closed attitude to Eastern European environmental organisations , such as 'Bankwatch' , and to the Eastern European public in general
For historical reasons , the road , rail and inland waterway networks on the European continent , as well as the ports and airports , have , apart from a few rare exceptions , been designed
Thanks to the tireless efforts of our colleague G√ºnther L√ºttge , the European Parliament , with the help of the Commission , was able to organise Pan-European Transport Conferences in Prague , Crete and
The infrastructure needs assessment process is coordinated by the TINA group , which is made up of senior officials from the Member States and applicant countries and which has its secretariat
This is all very well , but I would have liked us to have been first given information on the state of progress of the 14 projects adopted in the common
As far as I can tell , of the 14 projects accepted at the Essen Council , only the link between Denmark and Sweden (Oresund) has been finished and the Milan-Malpensa airport
This silence is difficult to understand given that Willi Piecyk stated in his report that the completion of the trans-European transport network would require investments of at least ECU
I can still hear Jacques Delors advocating these trans-European networks , which he felt would create many jobs , and I still remember the decisions taken at the Luxembourg Employment Summit , but
I do not know , but I sincerely believe that in practically every country it is very difficult to envisage an increase in revenue or public expenditure , and that we
Can we link aid to certain conditions , such as that 40 % of the investment in transport infrastructure , which is deemed to be the most important , must be devoted
Without wanting to stand in the way of aid to the other neighbouring countries of the European Union , I wonder whether we are not holding these negotiations at a dangerously
The foreseeable developments in road transport telematics are significant and their consequences are positive in that they are likely to have a beneficial effect on the quality of life of
A balance exists between the jobs lost in the production and marketing sectors that become obsolete due to the application of new technologies to the network and to road traffic ,
I agree with the rapporteur that whether this balance is positive or negative will depend , for the most part , on whether or not our businesses are able to take
Consequently , I totally support the idea that we must help our businesses and , in order to do so , allocate substantial Community resources to the development and implementation of road transport
In my view , it was needed to enable us to provide appropriate protection for tourists and the industry , and of course to ensure the quality and environmental safety of
Mr M√©ndez de Vigo and I fought hard for the inclusion of a joint amendment to this effect in the Bourlanges-Martin report , because unlike certain sectors of the tourist industry
Having said this , and to leave nobody in any doubt , I wish to make it quite clear that I welcome this new report , which is an effort to fill the
In fact , according to the mid-term evaluation on the spending of EU monies in Ireland carried out by the economic and social research institute , over 30 000 jobs will have
The elimination of transaction costs in eleven Member States within the European Union encompassing a population of over 291 million people will means that the cost of travel and
A single European currency will bring with it an increased number of tourists which will mean an increase in the number of jobs created in the tourist industry in Ireland
In light of the fact that over 30 000 jobs will have been created between the years 1994-1999 in the tourism industry in Ireland , it is therefore very clear that
After all , Mr Novo Belenguer himself writes in his report that promotional campaigns for specific national or regional destinations in Europe (for which read 'the EU') should be left
We could not agree more , and that is precisely why we think that the attempt of this report to get tourism covered by a common EU policy , amongst other
First , it shows the usefulness of these measures which either directly or indirectly seek to meet the needs of a sector which , despite an overall drop in demand of almost
10 % between 1975 and 1995 , continues to occupy a crucial place in the economy and in employment in the European Union (approximately 6 % of Community GDP , over 9
The usefulness of such measures allows us also to conclude , as we have previously stated , that cooperation between shared interests may be ensured without changing the existing legal framework ,
In addition , it is abundantly clear that these Community actions should be continued , without changing the legal framework and with the allocation of funding to increase the capacity for direct
Therefore , we share the conclusion that highlights the need to draw up policies and allocate funds (for training , among other things) with a view to guaranteeing a maximum number
It is nice to think that tourism brings jobs and prosperity to the regions , but I am highly sceptical about the idea of establishing a directorate for tourism within DG
Mr President , I am on record as having said at the time when we had the strike in this House that the institution was made up of its Members and
I must stress that these remarks are made with no consideration of nationality or political persuasion or membership of clubs or secret societies but because over the years - and
As regards , in particular , the famous carry-over of appropriations from the 1996 financial year to 1997 , the rapporteur has once more decided to defend the authorizing officer by blaming the
However , the Financial Controller did his job correctly by suggesting that , in order to solve the problem of the absence of the President of Parliament's signature within the allotted
This document also certified for the Financial Controller and the Secretary-General that the necessary procedures had been successfully completed , while its author had meanwhile tried to get the President
The rapporteur is asking us today to give discharge to the administration of the European Parliament , despite the fact that this episode demonstrated the alarming inefficiency of the procedure for
What is more , at its meeting of 25 February 1997 , the Committee on Budgetary Control approved the closing of the 1996 accounts , including the automatic carry-over of the appropriations
We are trying today to play down this affair by suggesting that , strictly speaking , there was no loss of funds , and that the Member States will do what is necessary
Nevertheless , we are surprised that the Miranda report , while deploring the extremely incomplete nature of the information contained in the revenue and expenditure account and financial balance sheet of
Colleagues , unfortunately we are not in a position to start the session because the first speaker will be Mr Santer , the President of the Commission , and we are still waiting
It is an important report , not only because of its content , to which I will return , but also because of the point in time at which it is being
In addition , the current system lacks transparency , partly because of the complexity of the correction mechanism for the United Kingdom , but also because of the debasing of the VAT
In this context , following the Cardiff European Council , the Commission has examined the proposal made recently by Spain with the backing of Greece and Portugal to insert a progressive element
Apart from the greater financial autonomy which would ensue , the main advantages of introducing new own resources in the system would be to enhance political accountability and visibility in
If we measure this list against a certain number of essential criteria , such as fairness between Member States or efficient collection procedures , we have to conclude that there are
However , it has been decided that any Member State sustaining a budgetary burden which is excessive in relation to its relative prosperity may benefit from a correction at the
If we look at this from a purely budgetary angle , the budgetary balances of these four Member States have indeed , for various reasons , worsened and are now of the same
In fact , the United Kingdom is no longer - and will probably be even less so after enlargement - in a unique position as regards its budget balance and
As regards the future size of the net balances of the four countries mentioned , excluding the cost of enlargement , Agenda 2000 may have no more than marginal , and not necessarily
But it is too early to say with any certainty what will happen on this front since so much depends on the final agreement on the reforms of the
Should it be agreed that a response must be found to the question of budgetary imbalances , the Commission has identified three fundamental options that , in addition , are not mutually
A large part of the budget , intended for structural expenditure , does of course contribute to these imbalances , but this is deliberate since this expenditure is explicitly designed to strengthen
To avoid any explosion of the gross resources , which would have to be redistributed between Member States , this option would have to involve a system of partial reimbursement of
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the reason why the Commission is today presenting its report on own resources is , I repeat , because it wants to see all the cards on
This may mean that we have an adequate margin - possibly until the next enlargement - to allow us to consider the questions raised in the report and to take
Thus , Article 130a states that the Community is committed to solidarity between the poorer and wealthier Member States , and establishes one of its aims as being to reduce disparities
At the same time , the performance of Member States' national economies - as you also described it - is , even in the VAT system , an essential factor in determining
At the same time , countries such as Sweden and the Netherlands , with lower GNPs , bear a much higher proportion of the financial burden than the portion of the common
Member States with a large farming sector and a high proportion of farms which qualify for support , such as Denmark or France , receive higher returns - regardless of their economic
An important precondition for this is that agricultural policy should tend to move away from price guarantees and towards a system of direct income aid coupled with measures to
Because these measures are applied directly on the spot in the Member States , it is appropriate to involve them in the funding , as is the case with the other
Much can be said about our proposal - which we are discussing here for the first time , so have not yet formally agreed - for example , that it will
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , you will hear many opinions today , Mr Santer , but one undeniable fact stands out: if the Union's gross domestic product does not grow by at
You must be aware - and I address myself now to the Commission , as Mr Santer is not present - that in this House you will encounter many Members who
Mr Liikanen , the Commission of which you are a member has become infected by the virus of the theory of net balances and fair returns , and you have therefore taken
It is inadequate , as you will also be told by the European Council and , furthermore , the proposal is somewhat unworthy of a European institution which should be defending the
Our second concern relates to the fact that we must either define objectives and find the appropriate resources and means to realise them , which is the position we hold ,
or we must specify the resources from the outset and immediately lay down the objectives that may be achieved with those resources , which would appear to be the Commission's solution ,
Following the first line of reasoning , it is indeed possible and desirable to have a debate on the system of own resources , particularly with a view to resolving the distortions
It knows that it is not feasible to terminate the UK financial package , it knows that the system of a fair return would mean the end of the very
In addition , as has already been said , this option can be decided by a qualified majority in the Council and does not require a unanimously agreed revision of the
If the Member States were to pay for half of the direct subsidies in the agriculture budget out of their own pockets , Germany would make a net saving of DEM
Otherwise , there would be an outright increase in the EU budget , which would meet with resistance , in Germany too , from those who then had to pay for cofinancing out
In actual fact , for the first time in the Community , we have a document on the table which gives detailed figures and makes it clear what is realistic in
For anyone who thinks that the Portuguese Parliament will agree to foot the bill for the cuts that the Germans want to introduce through a ratification decision , is living
It is also good that the file has been closed on the proposal made by the Spanish Government , which thinks that there is a possibility of the net contributors forking
At this stage , however , I wish to emphasise quite clearly - I have said this here many times already and I underline it once more - that the European Union
The report also takes the wind out of the sails of those who are shouting the loudest - I shall not take those from my own country , but those
from the Netherlands , who are shouting loudly with us - because if you adjust the figures to take account of the Rotterdam effect , then the balance sheet for the Netherlands
Incidentally , if Mr Santer had still been with us , I would have said - and the Luxembourgers should take this on board - that if staffing costs are included , they
But now to the policy itself: it is a question - and this applies in Brussels in just the same way - of evening out the imbalances between the rich
It will not do for a country such as Denmark - which , measured on per capita GNP , is the richest in the Community - to be a net beneficiary ,
That is why I believe that the proposal made here for a corrective mechanism , based not on renationalising , but on cofinancing - and cofinancing is already the rule in
It came into force in 1984 - I wish to state this clearly here - at a time when 71 % of the budget was spent in the agriculture
Today , as a result of this rebate on their contribution , the British also receive a rebate on policies which have come to be of decisive importance for the Community
In the future , it will be enlargement to the East , and I say this to you , Mr Wynn: my social democrat friend , Tony Blair , will also find it hard
(Applause) Now , I know that this is a much more difficult area , because here decisions are by unanimity , and that is why I state very clearly: this Community has always
But what we need to prepare ourselves for , what my British colleagues need to prepare themselves for , is the need to find a sensible way to have those parts
I believe that the package put on the table in this House is a good package , which complements Agenda 2000 and will help us to reach a compromise next
Mr President , it was the current Federal Government , Mr Samland , and at its head Helmut Kohl and Theo Waigel , which demanded that the existing system of own resources should be
This restriction is no straightforward rebate , Mr Samland , but should , above all , be seen in the context of the spending reforms , and not only in the agricultural sector , but
And now you have it: cofinancing in the agricultural sector was the idea of our colleague , Mr B√∂ge; but , as always when there is every prospect of success , many
(Mixed reactions) I do not agree with the Commission's statement , in its summary , that there is no need to reform the current system of own resources at the present time ,
In fact , on this occasion and even more obviously than for Agenda 2000 as a whole , the Commission has put forward unduly cautious proposals , for fear of annoying the
The debate often tends to focus too much on Member State or Community budget balances , which is a more or less covert way of advocating the principle of fair
The media and many national parliaments refer to national contributions , forgetting that not only have they been obsolete for years , but that the Maastricht Treaty itself - a good few
They have not dared to break with the nationalistic approach which is really marring the European atmosphere and , in my opinion , they should have put forward a truly European
I am talking about a tax to finance a European budget which , translated into everyday terms , would amount to one cup of coffee a day at the University caf√©
This replaced the principle of benefit as a basis for calculating tax in European countries as far back as the nineteenth century , and the principle it replaced has not
If we cannot make progress and have to restrict the debate to an analysis of these proposals , I suggest that the majority of the proposals made do not even
At the same time , the European Union is on the threshold of the difficult business of establishing the euro , under such economic conditions and while we are facing the
But here , in the debate taking place in here , we are presented with a sorry picture of mean self-interest and nationalism , and we see Denmark opposite Germany and the
From this platform , I simply wish to appeal to the Greek Government , the Greek Prime Minister , when faced by the risks in particular of nationalising agricultural policy and burdening
Clearly there will be much discussion of this second option , the one concerning agriculture , because - if nothing else - it has the advantage of not requiring an immediate
Consideration of the proposed reform of the COM has already reached an advanced stage , including in Parliament , and I wonder whether some people might take this as an opportunity
Specific decisions were taken in the Agriculture Council - where the ministers often resort overhastily to their calculators when taking decisions - which have prevented the original goals from
If , by opening this discussion now , we can at last raise the quality of the whole debate on how to build more solidarity into the CAP , then I very much
There are also other , alternative means of giving greater scope to high-quality policies - the structural policies - which are the missing second pillar of national farm policy , rather
As we all know , national rebates are a real threat , but this road is already being followed implicitly even now , and in my opinion an inverted form of solidarity is
I think that this is a bad omen for the general report on next year's budget and I would simply like to say a few words on the proposals
I believe that the Commission is doing some very interesting work in trying to resolve a problem that is totally unsolvable - in other words , it is trying to
On the one hand and quite rightly , it is a budget based on vertical distribution , which benefits the less developed countries but which the more developed countries see as
On the other hand and also quite rightly , it is a budget based on transferring resources between sectors , from 97 % of the population to 3 % of the
The solutions envisaged by the Commission are based on a paradox worthy of Lewis Carroll: the tax that each of us must pay to the Community varies according to
As long as we do not have a true Community policy , involving the 15 Member States in objectives such as environment protection , transport networks and town and country planning ,
In our decision today and in our report we state that the shifts in the burden of financing implied by some of these options present regressive elements that might

Mr President , the oral questions about the uncontrolled waves of migrants from Mediterranean countries are primarily an expression of our concern for human beings who are seeking a better life ,
But often , instead of finding freedom , they end up dying a horrible death , becoming victims of the trade in human beings or finding that they are not welcome in
The Austrian Presidency is to be applauded for having the courage to put this issue on the agenda , but it was hypocritical of the Justice Ministers to refuse to
This is indeed the case , and Amnesty International , the ECRE and the UNHCR were right to criticise , but the position adopted by the Member States simply hides the fact
Europe's approach at the moment is making nimbies of us all , the burden is not being shared but pushed on to the next country , and asylum-seekers are shown degrading
Austria's revised strategy paper must be used as the basis for concrete plans , and we need to consider whether we can organise common reception and asylum procedures at or
This plan , which was put forward this week by a Dutch MP , will certainly require a European approach because , as we have already said , the Mediterranean problem requires a
We are not convinced by the reference to Europol and its involvement , because there is still no proper protection of data; nor is there a clear legal context for
Lastly , migration cannot be regarded as a police or border problem; it is an overall cultural and economic problem , which calls for an EU policy of development in the
As announced , it should have borne the date of 1 July , but it now seems to have been replaced by another document which has still not been forwarded to
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , since the Austrian strategy paper was one of the first things to be mentioned here , I should like to say a few words on that ,
On the contrary , the paper is concerned , amongst other things , with complementary systems for protecting persons fleeing from war zones , exceptional humanitarian cases , and other areas not included in
I should also like to say that the subject of asylum and immigration is not actually a new one at all as far as cooperation in the EU is
concerned , because in 1991 , the European Commission was already giving some thought to establishing a strategy on migration policy at European level in two communications on immigration and the right
But I am not going to go into what was a historic initiative at the time , I would prefer instead to set out some of the essential details of the
There is , in fact , a 1992 declaration of principles on migration policy , which included some specific strategic points which should now be useful for guiding future European policy on
Among these are the common desire to reduce the causes of migration through appropriate measures relating to the regions of origin , the development of a common policy for the
temporary protection of the displaced , the fight against illegal immigration , the conclusion of agreements with countries of origin and transit , the ratification of the Dublin Convention and the adoption of
Then , in 1994 , the European Commission made an extensive new attempt at developing a plan for migration policy , by submitting a very comprehensive and substantial communication to the European
The purpose of the migration plan , which was seen in isolation in those days , was to come up with an integrated and coherent answer to what was happening on
As for the degree to which this concept has been implemented , we find that today , after four years , clearly visible and measurable success has been achieved in only three
In this regard , we should not overlook the result of work in the third pillar , which has resulted in some 70 legal acts from the Council in the area
The following legal acts were adopted: a standard travel document for the return of third country nationals , a specimen draft of a bilateral agreement for repatriation between a Member
In addition , I would also like to point out that , in accordance with its decision of 16 December 1996 , the Council regularly examines the actual implementation of the legal acts
Of course we have our contribution to make here but this is one of the main elements of the Barcelona process , and a great deal is being done in
As has been made very clear , on behalf of the presidency , this phenomenon not only affects the southern Member States; migratory pressures constitute real and complex challenges for the
I entirely agree that the only viable response is to adopt a comprehensive and long-term strategy , as stated in the Commission's 1994 communication on migration and asylum policy , to which
The need to give international protection to persons fleeing from war zones is , of course , a different issue from illegal immigration and Parliament itself took the initiative for two
I can assure you that the Commission will make the most of these new provisions in order to help manage immigration flows , to improve the fight against trafficking in human
Some parts of the European Union are not much more than ten kilometres away from the north of Africa , and that narrow strait is becoming a gigantic common grave for
The Algerians , for instance , whose situation is not so very different from that described by the Commissioner when referring to Kosovo , leave their homeland , which is now a powder
I am referring , of course , to police cooperation , and dialogue with third countries to enable us to make a joint attempt to fight against trafficking in human beings , and
We need to deal with the situation of those who , through mafias or through their own initiative , leave their homeland in search of a better life and try to
Some of these people have been arrested near my home - in Catalonia , which is in the north of Spain - as they attempted to enter France , in the
Above all , however , we must not look the other way , waiting for press headlines on large or small numbers of corpses washed up on our shores , waiting to have
Faced with this situation , we need to increase cooperation within the European Union , strengthening , as has already been stated , the regular exchange of information on the criminal networks organising
Nevertheless , in order to resolve this problem we must speed up the creation of a common judicial and police area , and of a coherent and homogeneous policy on immigration
The Council and the Commission should warn the Maghreb and the Mediterranean countries that unless they take action against illegal immigration , the European Union will , regrettably , be forced to
The European Union - the Austrian Presidency has already commented along these lines - should not sign any more agreements in the region unless they include the clause on
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , allow me to begin by congratulating the authors of this import and laudable initiative , which is highly topical in the light of current events now
There has never been a time in the history of this continent when peoples have not been moving from one place to another as a result of famine , war ,
So to think that migratory flows can be checked by building fortresses or barriers - which this time would have to go through the middle of the Mediterranean Sea
Public opinion in our countries would do well to understand this , and therefore all xenophobic campaigns , or ones based on keeping foreigners out , are a huge mistake which will
So we must make a major effort: convey the fact that there are , nowadays , many jobs which our fellow citizens no longer wish to do , and that immigration can
So let us no longer consider immigration as an uncontrolled influx of labour supply - and it is clear that controls are important here - but as being driven
If we can alter our mind-set in this way , we shall give hope for the future not only to citizens from the other side of the Mediterranean , but also
Mr President , despite the sad tone of some of the preceding speeches , I feel obliged to point out to you that immigration into Europe from the southern Mediterranean countries is
Immigration is on the increase , as a result of the worsening social , political and economic situation in the countries of the southern Mediterranean , and international criminal gangs trafficking in immigrants
At the same time , immigrants are dying in flimsy craft trying to reach the shores of Europe , and the Member States are introducing ever more repressive measures to protect
In the context of such a policy of north-south cooperation , based on a quite different philosophy from the present one , the European Union must combat illegal immigration , its networks and
It must put in place a common immigration policy based on principles of cooperation and solidarity with those states , and not on principles which are essentially economic and repressive ,
In conclusion , Mr President , I would like to quote some words spoken yesterday in Madrid at the launching of Sami Nair's latest book , entitled: 'Mediterr√°neo hoy , entre el di√°logo y
Mr President , for many years now thousands of people from North African countries have been trying , by taking risks that are well known , to cross the Mediterranean and gain a
The attitude adopted by all our institutions up to now has been appalling: we turn them back , we send them back , we try to contain them , we make things up
Men and women , who have already been victims of these gangsters , are then locked up , deported , humiliated and murdered by policemen in aeroplanes , in front of dazed passengers , who
But in the joint motion for a resolution , it proposes as a solution the reform of the immigration policy provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam and , in this
Such a measure would make illegal immigration from the South a great deal easier: the immigrants would only have to look for a weak point somewhere to be able
This measure would be dangerous and even dictatorial , because it is unthinkable that in the future national parliaments and governments might no longer have any right of proposal in
On the contrary , we must rely on the present Member States to negotiate a common immigration policy , to make our territory secure again while respecting the will of each
Firstly , the countries of Europe are not immigrant countries , yet they are currently facing enormous problems with foreign nationals and are simply not in a position to take any more
Secondly , it is in the interests of all the countries of Europe to maintain the best possible relations with the countries across the Mediterranean , which is precisely where political and
We need to focus our development aid as far as possible on those countries and conclude agreements not just to rule out further migration , but to leave the door
Thirdly , I still think that a territoriality principle must be introduced for political asylum-seekers , so that genuine political refugees - and these make up only a very small percentage of
Most people in every country in Europe and every section of the population would be glad to support such a humane policy , which is certainly not the case with
Few Members , I imagine , except the Spanish Members of Parliament , were aware that the European Union has a land border with Morocco and I had the opportunity recently to
Groups of them build up in the two camps , the one in Ceuta , which is very sub-standard , and the more well- established camp in Melilla , which has been funded
From time to time the economic refugees , most of whom are French or English speaking , are decanted over to Spain where they are issued with temporary papers and then
We need to ensure that we have asylum legislation that actually works and that those who are in fear of torture or death can come into the European Union
We have to ensure that the political situation there is such that its people can remain there rather than have to flee , abandoning their homes and , in many cases ,
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Group of the European People's Party calls on the Commission , and above all the Council , to ensure that this problem is tackled thoroughly , in
political and practical terms - under the third chapter of the Barcelona Declaration , and more generally under the European Union's third pillar - by introducing specific actions for the monitoring
What I would stress is the essential need for coordination at European level on a problem which , although it has an immediate impact on the EU states bordering on the
It is pointless to leave it up to the individual Member States to handle a crisis which is in no sense bilateral - it cannot be handled by EU countries
It would therefore be advisable to institute a form of multilateral cooperation , perhaps based on cooperation between the Council of Ministers and third countries , and on Community framework legislation
designed to tackle the repatriation of all clandestine immigrants in the same fashion , always with due regard for their basic rights , and helping at the same time to consolidate democratic ,
Only by means of such an approach , which should be incorporated into both the MEDA programme and the Schengen Agreement , will it be possible in future to protect the rights
of immigrants , who should no longer be clandestine but sought out by Europe on the basis of a new employment policy and new , clear , social legislation enabling them to be
Madam President , our colleagues' questions , and in particular the one from Mrs Schaffner , once again raise a question of substance: how is it possible to handle in a humane and
A common policy would prevent individual Member States from passing the buck or implementing dissimilar , contrasting policies both in terms of reception , expulsion or insertion into the world of work
- with the ensuing social prerogatives - and in terms of the concomitant and much-needed policy of developing economic activities and production in countries where people are still today dying
We need cooperation projects and measures to combat organised crime , which is causing a real exodus of desperate people who are destined to become the foot-soldiers of these criminal
Madam President , I do not think that we should be discussing immigration policy in general terms today; we should be considering new approaches , such as those outlined just now by
Above all , we should be focusing our attention today on what is happening in the southern part of Europe , the region which on the one hand is the most
Last year I visited the Kurdish refugee camps in southern Italy , and almost all of those to whom I spoke - Kurds from Sri Lanka and from Pakistan -
We must bear all of this in mind - the worst possible exploitation of dreams , hopes and needs - and we must realise that it is more than just a
Whereas it is fair to expect us - Italy , Spain , and Greece when it joins the Schengen area - to carry out careful surveillance of our coastlines , it is
With regard to reception centres , for example , if immigrants are to be housed in dignity and with respect for their human rights , there is a pressing need for many more
We urge the Austrian Presidency , or at the latest the German Presidency , to implement all the measures being called for during this debate: humanitarian assistance , joint monitoring , funding and
They should do so before next summer - which will soon be here - because that is when there is an increased risk of deaths in the Straits of
We have the Geneva Convention , but we know that this is no longer enough , because only 10 % of those who come to us are treated as asylum-seekers in accordance
I am glad that you have mentioned the need , for instance , to reduce the pressure for migration through intervention in the crisis regions , to combat trafficking in human beings ,
Legal checks on entry were mentioned as a general concept for the Union , and so was new protection for refugees , because first and foremost , we need a division of
Madam President , all the Member States of the European Union have contributed to the Euro-Mediterranean policy , and they should also all contribute to helping the Member States who have to
As we know , this problem has arisen as a result of the immoral differences in earnings between the northern and southern Mediterranean countries , which can be as much as
We should make use of those very television channels through which we have created the myth of a European wonderland , making many young people from the Maghreb believe in a
We should use those same television channels to broadcast information , dissuading these young people and informing them of the very real risks they run , telling them about the slavery
Those young illegal immigrants whose corpses are washed up are , in the main , the victims of a European dream we are creating here , in the European Parliament , as we
Madam President , nowadays , the European Union is a prime destination for many who , travelling from the Eastern countries , Latin America , and northern and central Africa , wish to cross its borders
Highly dangerous methods of crossing from Africa are resorted to , some of which have been referred to earlier - these flimsy craft - and , as a result , thousands of
The political stability of those countries must be promoted , and they should make the best use of their human and natural resources to transform the Euro-Mediterranean area into a
The association agreements - the negotiation and ratification of which is unacceptably slow , the Barcelona Conference - full of good intentions but with few practical results , and the MEDA programmes
As I live in Melilla , a town on the border between the European Union and Morocco , I have witnessed the Spanish Government's determined effort to make a serious attempt
We had no problems in doing so but I would , however , like to raise several points that I feel strongly about in relation to the debate on immigrants from
We must also take account of the fact that immigration is due to deep-seated causes that go beyond the purely technical aspect of crossing external borders that has been
I believe that , in this respect , we need to highlight the despair of the immigrants who have no hope of a future in their own country and who therefore believe
Therefore , we must highlight the importance of a systematic evaluation of the European Union's policy concerning the Mediterranean with a view to making this policy more effective , rather than
I have observed that many Members from the Mediterranean region have spoken here and that is why the issue of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership is an essential part of this
I would like to point out that this partnership includes three areas: political dialogue , the economic issue (which of course includes socio-economic elements) , and then the additional question of
We must find a way of deterring criminals , especially traffickers in human beings (whom I shall discuss later) , on the one hand , and accepting legitimate humanitarian refugees on the
We must also , however , show solidarity , and that is something that I would call for especially as President-in-Office from a country which has done a great deal for refugees ,
This issue was raised by one Honourable Member only in relation to the Mediterranean region , but I would point out that in the case of Bosnia , for instance , we have
I agree with what was said in the debate - it is also true that we should , of course , tell countries that they are not just going to find a
But this question is being worked on very closely in the European Union context too , as we consider it to be important not only with respect to the Mediterranean
It is not for nothing that this issue was also a subject at the European conference yesterday , but as I talked about this in detail earlier on , I will
The next item is the report (A4-0312/98) by Mr Cushnahan , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy , on the Commission communication to the Council on
Having closely monitored the situation for 15 months , including a visit to Hong Kong to meet and listen to a wide cross section of viewpoints , I believe that the transition
However , I have a number of concerns in relation to the implementation of democracy , the operation of the rule of law and the protection of human rights , which are detailed
It would be reassuring for Members of this Parliament , and others elsewhere including in Hong Kong itself who are committed to democratic principles , that a firm and unambiguous timetable
The implementation of the rule of law requires that the powers of government , judicial , legislative and executive , be separate from and independent of each other so that each is
In the unusual , indeed unique , HKSAR constitutional arrangements where autonomy is threatened by surrogacy , the independence of the judiciary assumes extra importance in discharging its role of upholding the rule
Any objective observer must worry that a number of recent cases , notably the Xinhua case , the Hong Kong Standard case , the Ma Wai Kwan case and the right of abode
The suspension of labour laws , attempts to undermine the editorial freedom of the press and the implications of the introduction of laws under Article 23 of the Basic Law
We must strengthen existing links and establish new ones and it is of fundamental and symbolic importance that all Member States should grant free access to HKSAR and BNO
I hope the Commissioner , who I am glad to see here for this debate , will take on board the recommendations included in this report when he produces his own
I am very glad to see also that the new guidelines that will be introduced for Radio Television Hong Kong will be based on those applying to the BBC
We should celebrate the high turn-out in those elections and the fair way in which they were conducted , although we should still register our concern at the severe reduction
One further area which will need to be watched carefully is the need for the new Legislative Council to pass legislation on issues such as subversion and treason under
The best sign of the success of 'one country , two systems' has been that Hong Kong has been able , so far , to weather the Asian crisis , and to do so
Let us hope that we can continue to work closely with the authorities of Hong Kong to develop a better future for the residents of Hong Kong and to
The country came more and more to be seen as a role model by developing countries fighting their way out of poverty - a factor which certainly contributed towards the
We concluded that the elections were free and fair , that there is no very tangible change in Hong Kong and that by and large the citizens continue to enjoy
Hong Kong people must speak out against every potential abuse , and we must support them in so doing , not just by giving them visa-free entry to the European Union but
If we are to feel our way towards a new relationship with China , let us welcome China's signature on Monday of the ICCPR; but we shall know them also
Last week one of Hong Kong's most powerful men , Sir Donald Chang , visited my country , and while in The Hague gave a further illustration of how Hong Kong , as
Last month the authorities did , admittedly , intervene in the share markets to prevent speculation - successfully , according to reports I have read - but in my view this was a
There was just one thing that Sir Donald Chang was seriously concerned about , and that was the extremely slow and ineffective measures that Japan is taking to restore order
Madam President , the historic and decisive fact about the issue we are debating is that after 100 years of forced British colonialism , Hong Kong has rejoined and is an inseparable
While that is the situation , I fear that Mr Cushnahan's report , in the ten recitals and 19 paragraphs of its motion for a resolution , is governed and permeated by
But beyond that , Madam President , I fear that this report wishes to appoint the European Parliament , the European Union as a joint detective agency , inquiring into what is going on
That is naive and indeed suspect , because it shows that all the concern about what is happening in Hong Kong is just viewed as a springboard , a tool for
We must stress in passing that it is important to grant entry to those holding a passport from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region without requiring a visa , just as
The EU must undertake every necessary effort to foster appropriate contacts , and above all to speak out against the alarming anti-democratic tendencies cited in the report , and the lack
Madam President , we all have good reasons for following developments in Hong Kong - which are examined in great detail by the rapporteur , whom I congratulate - for itself , for
On the one hand , it has been possible over these years to provide the territory with infrastructure and services which have been particularly important for its development and for the
Moreover , and of particular significance , the Legislative Assembly has been approving the territory's own legislation , in complete freedom and in accordance with universal values that are also the values of
Having already had an identity of its own - Macau is a member of the World Trade Organisation and has a cooperation agreement with the European Union - we
But over and above our own interests and those of Macau , we consider that the interests of China are at stake here , which has in Macau an area of
It is important , therefore , that the Commission - and for that reason , I address the Commissioner - should give Macau a higher profile through its representation in Hong Kong or ,
I am still concerned about this , particularly when I hear some speakers say that the visa question is something we do not take seriously , and that only eight countries
Firstly , a number of speakers , of whom Mr Titley was one and Mr Watson another , also Mr Gahrton and most recently Mr Brinkhorst , have commented generally on the nature of
I really want to underline the remarkable nature of what has occurred because it is true to say that the introduction of the one country/two systems arrangement is unique ,
In his visit to Brussels last February the Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa said: 'It is up to us , the people of Hong Kong , to decide for ourselves the further
During my own last visit to Hong Kong I stated publicly that Hong Kong would earn credit at little cost by announcing as early as possible that it intends
We should recognize , however , Hong Kong's efforts so far , as Mr Cushnahan has done , while keeping up the pressure for a clear timetable to full democracy , as he urges
While the Commission has no direct responsibility over EU visa policy , which is still intergovernmental until a common visa list is introduced under the Amsterdam Treaty , we strongly support
In fact - and Mr Brinkhorst has perhaps been a shade too generous to the Member States in his statement of the position - it is the case that the
Such programmes now exist and I hope they will help to persuade those Member States who have yet to be persuaded of the merits of visa-free entry for SAR
With regard to the WTO , the EP resolution advocates close cooperation between the European Union and Hong Kong within the WTO , and I would agree with what Mr Porto said
The Commission is convinced that Hong Kong's liberal economy , not least its open trading regime , underpinned by WTO membership , will act as an example and a spur to continued
We are on the verge of concluding a customs cooperation agreement with Hong Kong which I hope President Santer will be able to initial when in Hong Kong , while
We need to take account of the delicate division of responsibilities between Hong Kong and Beijing in the foreign relations field but we need , nonetheless , to explore what Hong Kong
The European Union continues to pursue deeper bilateral relations in other areas , notably by encouraging business-to-business links; the first plenary session of the EU-Hong Kong Business Committee took place
The Commission is monitoring the financial and economic situation from our office in Hong Kong , but also by means of frequent visits from officials in the SAR and through
Mr Titley is right , in my view , to say that Hong Kong's problems have been formidable but nonetheless the crisis has been weathered there very much better than in many
other countries in the region , and I would agree wholeheartedly with what Mr Burenstam Linder has said about the fact that it is liberal economic policies which have brought about
Lately it has resorted to more drastic measures , to curb speculation by traders seeking to depress the currency in order to hike up interest rates and benefit from the
The measures which were referred to by Mrs van Bladel are three-fold in character: a decision to buy shares in the stock market which boosted the share index by 19
% over two weeks; further measures to strengthen the currency board , increase liquidity and calm the volatility of inter-bank interest rates; and , thirdly , measures to improve transparency and enforce greater
Parliament's resolution declares that the EC office in Hong Kong must be able to play a significant role in the development of EU-China relations and suggests that staff resources should
I entirely agree with Mrs van Bladel that an effective and well-staffed EU Office in Hong Kong is essential , and staff deployments have recently been made to strengthen the
Finally , the EP resolution welcomes our intention to produce annual reports; we are now finalizing the first one and hope to transmit it to the Council and Parliament by the
Needless to say , we will take account of , and greatly benefit from , the observations and recommendations made in Parliament's reports and resolutions , and particularly Mr Cushnahan's excellent report and
Is the Council aware that the UK police are mistreating members of the National Union of Journalists , especially freelance members , by not recognising their press cards , arresting them for trespass
or obstruction or even under the Harassment Act (intended for preventing 'stalking') , assaulting them , holding them until their deadlines have passed , preventing them from taking pictures , confiscating their photographs with
If it wishes to be taken seriously outside the EU on such matters , will the Council instruct the Commission to ensure that journalists may operate freely within the EU
Mr President , may I say the following in response to the Honourable Member's question: the ruthless treatment and the harassment of freelance journalists is a matter which unfortunately does not
Upholding public order in the sovereign territory of a Member State is actually , as I should also point out at this time , the sole responsibility of the police authorities
Also , I should stress that respect for human rights and democratic freedoms , and also of course the preservation of press freedom , form the cornerstone of the entire construction of
However , it is truly convinced that in their actions the governments of Member States will always be guided by the basic principles mentioned above , principles without which the Community
When you say that you cannot prevent occasional shortcomings as regards freedom of the press , you have to ensure that it is prevented because Article F of the Maastricht
They have been harassed by the police , their offices and homes have been raided , equipment has been confiscated and the pictures they have taken at protests have been used
Perhaps you cannot prevent what has happened , but you can ensure that it does not happen again and that this will not be a signal to other Member States
I have just explained - and I would like to stress this once again - that the Council is not authorised to say anything about the conduct of police
I would emphasise again , if it is necessary to do so , that only the competent authorities of the individual state have the power to judge police behaviour in that
However , there is something I can add: there is the Council of Europe and the European Convention on Human Rights , and complaints can also be made to the European
I am struck by the fact that her answers are inspired by the 'Pontius Pilate' tactic , whereas it was pointed out to the President-in-Office that even the Treaties provide
Would she answer in the same way if such incidents of flagrant violation of the freedom of the press were to happen in Hong Kong , for example , which we
So how can we be Pontius Pilate in one case , while in the other we jump in with both feet , as it were , into the internal affairs of a
What level of funding have the EU institutions provided for the construction of the gas pipeline which is to go from Almendralejo (Extremadura) to Oviedo , in Spain as part of
Mr President , Mr Camis√≥n Asensio , the gas pipeline that the Honourable Member refers to is part of Project E4 listed in Decision No 1254/96/EC of the European Parliament and of
E4 is part of the 'Introduction of natural gas into new regions' section , and deals with the development of gas networks in the regions of Galicia , Extremadura , Andalusia , the
In accordance with Article 6(2) of this decision , following an opinion from the committee provided for in Article 9 of the Decision of 11 July 1998 , the Commission laid down
In view of the explanations already given , I would refer you to the Commission , which will provide you with more precise information on exact amounts and specific questions , especially
Can the representative of the Council of Ministers indicate how many times representatives of the Council have attended meetings of the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament (either since
the start of the year or the start of the Austrian Presidency) and what additional procedures the Council has available to monitor petitions to Parliament , especially as frequent allegations are
Mr President , in response to Mr Perry's very interesting question on petitions , I should stress that the Council regularly takes note of Parliament resolutions , including those concerning the right of
As far as possible failures on the part of Member States to comply with the Community's legal provisions are concerned , let me refer you also to Article 155 of
the Treaty , which says that one of the duties of the Commission is to 'ensure that the provisions of this Treaty and the measures taken by the institutions pursuant thereto
The question was on measures to be adopted by the Council and , in particular , we queried whether the Austrian Presidency has any plans to ensure that the Council will
Unfortunately , it is frequently the case that the Member States fail to comply with many Community rules , and no proper mechanisms exist for the Member States to reply in
I would therefore be grateful , Madam President-in-Office , if you could tell me whether arrangements are being made to ensure that the Council will be present at meetings of the
Mr President , Mrs De Esteban Martin , in replying to this supplementary question , I cannot really add anything of substance to what I said a moment ago , namely that the Council
In addition , I can say that in a case where the responsibilities in question are the Council's own (something that is purely hypothetical , as I said) , then it would
However , in this matter , I would refer the Honourable Member to the division of powers between the different institutions established in the Treaty , according to which it is primarily
In the past few years , all we have had is an occasional visit from a representative of the Council , sometimes when the Ombudsman was present to give a report
Could the same apply for the Committee on Petitions so that we can have dialogue between the Council and the members of that committee , as happens in other committees of
According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) , when the Dayton agreements were signed in December 1995 , more than 1 million Bosnians were displaced within
Does the Council not consider that , nearly three years after the signature of the Dayton agreements , the fact that only 20 % of all the refugees and displaced persons have
been able to return to their place of origin means that the Dayton agreements have essentially failed , confirming , de facto , the project for ethnic partition that was conceived , wanted , planned
and implemented by the regime in Belgrade - a project which , we should remember , entailed war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocidal crimes which are now known throughout the international
It has never been problem-free , and the fact that most refugees who have not yet returned must go back to areas in which they will form a minority complicates
Consequently , the strategy of the international community has been aiming at the longer term , and its most important task consists of improving the local security situation , such as by improving
The state of progress in Bosnia will be measured in October , when the EU Commission carries out its regular six-monthly review of compliance with the criteria laid down in the
At the last review in April , the Commission ruled out establishing cooperation agreements with Bosnia , Croatia , and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , citing overall concerns on democratic reforms , respect
In fact , given that it is now three years since the Dayton agreement was signed , I think that we should be starting to learn our first lessons from the
Mr President , Mr Dupuis , I believe that there is one thing in particular that you can say about Bosnia-Herzegovina , and this is that if the international community had wanted to
For the first time since the Dayton Peace Agreement was signed , moderate parties in favour of the Dayton Agreement are in control of the legislative branches in both territorial areas
Although the result of the presidential elections in the Republika Srpska does constitute a symbolic defeat , it is compensated for by the substantial gains for parties supporting Dayton at
It remains to be seen over the next few weeks whether the Sloga coalition in the Republika Srpska will be able to retain control of the Parliament and whether
These considerations should enable us to be prepared when we go into the next Peace Implementation Conference in December in Madrid , where we will continue to advocate a multi-ethnic ,
Mr President , Madam President-in-Office , I have to be honest with you - I have one specific problem with the entire Dayton Agreement , and it is that one of the parties
They have set up a consulate in Banja Luka and made rapid changes to the law , especially as far as the right of abode of certain persons in Krajina
But basically , as long as the other party is Milosevic - and we are seeing at the moment what is happening in Kosovo - I have to say honestly
The most important is probably that , through the Agreement , we have managed for the first time to consolidate the ceasefire and give the different parties the chance to live
For that , I think that both the media and the electoral system need to be reformed and , as you know , there is a whole series of projects which are
As for the constitutional state , the creation of an independent multi-ethnic judiciary , a professional multi-ethnic police force , and resistance to all forms of parallel structure are also prerequisites for
I do not say everything , and I do not say that the situation there could not be improved a great deal in a few years time , but I think
that we must continue the fight to strengthen the joint institutions and reform the Council of Ministers , and to set up an authority to monitor the revenue of the state
Mr President , I would like to ask the President-in-Office if she would agree with me that the small number of refugees returning may surely also be put down to the
I know that in Austria , many Bosnian refugees have found housing , work , and integration into society , and that is also another reason why they do not want to go
Mr President , Mrs Flemming , of course it is true that some countries , like Austria for instance , have taken in refugees , not only from Bosnia , but also elsewhere , and have done
Of course , the return depends on how fast we are able to build up the economy there , so that they can find work , and how quickly we can create
Is the Council aware of the letter of 3 August sent by Mrs Albright , United States Secretary of State , to Mr Helms , Chairman of the US Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee ,
Does the Council consider that the interpretation placed on the terms of the declarations of 18 May by the US Secretary of State is in keeping with the spirit of
Mr President , Mr Salafranca Sanchez-Neyra , the Council is of course aware of the letter sent by Secretary of State Mrs Albright to the chairman of the US Senate's Foreign Affairs
The Union's position on the matter is set out in the EU unilateral statement , which also forms part of the London package , and which was confirmed by the Council
The Union does not accept that anything in the London summit package in any way vindicates the principles underlying the Liberty Act , particularly not the imposition of secondary boycotts and
On the question of expropriation , in a letter to Mrs Albright of 18 May which is also part of the London package , Sir Leon Brittan has accepted that according to
The problem is that in the interpretation of the agreements between the European Union and the United States set out in that letter , it is stated that this interpretation serves
My second question is: what time period does the Council consider is needed to implement the terms of the agreement , and in particular for the amendment of Title IV of
I have the impression , Madam President-in-Office , that in view of the present situation in the United States , President Clinton will not be able to count on the majority required
So , in brief , I would like to know , firstly , whether the Council shares the philosophy of the letter and , secondly , what would the Council consider a reasonable period of time
Indeed , if Congress does not amend Title IV of the Act and the United States therefore does not keep its part of the bargain , what action would the European
Mr President , Mr Salafranca Sanchez-Neyra , allow me to start by saying that I myself first met Cuba's Foreign Minister in New York , both as President-in-Office of the Council and also
On that occasion , it was noticeable that Cuba seemed willing - and I deliberately say 'seemed' because it remains untested - to accept a type of dialogue similar to
I should like to ask the President of the Council , in the event of the agreement of 18 May coming into force - which appears unlikely at present - if
the Minister can assure the House that this will not lead to the creation of serious obstacles for European traders seeking to carry on business activities in Cuba , those being
Mr President , Mr Newens , the European Union is greatly interested in improving transatlantic relations and especially in foreign policy cooperation , and differences in opinion on Cuba should not impair the
Secondly , persuading the US that the critical-but-cooperative dialogue between the EU and Cuba is more successful in the longer term for the international community's relations with Cuba than the
There is probably little more she can say in reply , but I do share Mr Salafranca's concern , in the sense that the Commission and the Council should reply to
It states that the European Union has undertaken not to award loans , subsidies , grants , tax advantages , guarantees or political risk insurance , or to give any kind of favourable treatment
We were present at a hearing organised by the Committee on External Economic Relations at which European businessmen voiced their serious concern and explained how this very agreement , which is
The letter goes on to state something even more surprising , namely that the European Union must refer to the information which the United States holds on expropriated assets before helping
However , leaving everything else aside , if only for the sake of the large number of businessmen - many Spaniards and other Europeans who have interests in Cuba - we
Most importantly , the provisions of the Helms-Burton Act which had resulted in numerous restrictions on trade and transport remained in force and therefore the extraterritorial nature of the US
According to Havana , the only thing which the US offered in return was a vague undertaking to the EU by the US Administration that they would try to have
But the US is increasingly asking for this type of commitment , to demonstrate to the US Congress and to the American people that the EU is not distancing itself
Of course the EU will not accept that anything in the package of measures agreed at the London summit in any way vindicates the principles of the Liberty Act , particularly
Mr President , Mr Hager , let me first of all repeat what I said during the discussion on migrants today , that the Presidency's paper is a discussion document which aims to
It does not claim to provide an overview of future EC-policy in these areas , but does - as similar initiatives earlier (like the Commission's communication of 1994) - try
As stated in the paper , the Presidency invited delegations to submit comments in writing by September and has received contributions so far from the German , Greek , Swedish and UK delegations
Mr President , Madam President-in-Office , I regret the fact that my question has lost some of its relevance since it was submitted - this has all become common knowledge in the
If I take what you have said and what you explained in detail this afternoon about withdrawing parts of the paper , and turn the argument on its head , can
On the one hand we have to find a way to combat the despicable trade of trafficking in human beings , while on the other we must also find a
Mr President , Mr Sj√∂stedt , I do not think it is very sensible for us to enter into discussion on a paper that is not even officially before us , and in
Nevertheless , there is great concern in Parliament , in particular in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs , that Parliament seemed not to have been involved as we would
I hope that I can have an assurance that the revised document will be made available in time for Parliament to consider it and to express any views before
Further to that , I wish to say that I am sure the President-in-Office will be aware that there has been a lot of concern expressed about some of the suggestions
- admittedly no more than suggestions - within this draft paper , to the effect that we should modify in a major way the existing Geneva Convention and possibly remove the
Of course many of the refugees coming into Western Europe today are coming in a different way to that perceived 50 years ago at the time of the Geneva
However , it seems to me that their plight and the problems they suffer are the same , whether they are being persecuted by a government or simply fleeing disorder , civil
In the first draft , and especially in the version passed on to the press , there may perhaps have been some unclear wording , but the revised version does not contain
Secondly , the procedure we have followed is entirely in keeping with the usual practice of not putting a first draft , which does not take into account the general positions of
Is the Council aware of the wide divergence within the EU of the cost of motor vehicles and the cost of motor vehicle insurance and does the Council consider that
As regards the cost of motor vehicles , reference should be made to Regulation 1474/95/EEC which is a Commission Regulation laying down certain rules applicable to distribution contracts in the
On the subject of possible distortion of competition in the single market regarding the cost of motor insurance and/or motor vehicles , it is up to the Commission to take whatever
steps it deems necessary to ensure the proper application of the relevant legislation and to ensure the smooth running of the internal market in general , as well as in this
The fact that we have failed , and the Council has failed , to harmonise taxation , creates a situation in which motor vehicles cost a lot more in the first place ,
The fact that insurance companies in the UK , Belgium and Germany are not competing in the Irish market was due , I felt , to a failure of the European Union
Mr President , Mr McCartin , as I have already explained in my earlier reply with particular regard to the car sector , the Commission has adopted a number of rules to ensure
In this connection , it would be useful to point out that under Chapter 5 of the Treaty , common rules on competition are the particular responsibility of the Commission , and
If it is established nevertheless that distortions in the car market are occurring , then of course the Council will devote its full attention to any proposals the Commission deems
Mr President , the discrepancies between the different prices are so great that we have instances such as this: people who work in Germany , young working people who bring to Greece
a car which their parents have bought , are in the end forced to give it up to the Greek state because they cannot afford the huge tax imposed by Greek
Let me point out once again that it is the Commission's job , not the Council's , to see that the single market functions smoothly and that the rules on competition
As for the completion of a single market for insurance , I would once again request the Member to contact the Commission , because that is the body responsible for ensuring
You have been very politically balanced in whom you have called upon to speak , but I wanted to ask why , when we were on the very thorny issue of
the Austrian strategy paper , you only gave the floor to two representatives of the Socialist Group , although I was the first to raise my hand the very second when you
The way in which women are depicted by the mass media is contributing to the increased sexual exploitation of women in Europe , while those involved in the white slave
Mr President , Mrs Karamanou , in response to your question , I would first like to stress that the Council is fully aware that this issue and the points you have raised
The Austrian Presidency shall therefore try to the best of its ability to bring to an early conclusion the consultations currently underway on issues such as the joint action to
fight child pornography on the Internet , the Community action plan on encouraging the safe use of the Internet by fighting illegal and harmful content , and the Community action programme on
You must however know how far-reaching the influence of these criminal organisations using prostitution is - this abhorrent business , which disregards the individual freedom of victims , operates at an international
Because of the international nature of the Internet , the Council's view is that the fight against organised prostitution must take place at an international level , and for this of course
These involve in particular a plan to end crime organised on an international level , a protocol on trafficking in women and children and a draft voluntary protocol to the agreement
I thank the President-in-Office for her answer , although I think it falls far short of satisfying not only me but even herself , since so little has been done by the
The European Parliament has repeatedly called for the Council and the Commission to adopt drastic and effective measures to do something about the international networks of modern white slavers ,
I would like to ask the President-in-Office what the Council has done to create new , appropriate and effective European institutions , capable of developing joint action at international and European
In other words , I would like to ask: does the Council intend to apply Community law and measures across national borders , to suppress a phenomenon which is steadily taking
And also , Minister , I would like you to tell me how far we are along the way towards ratification of the Europol Convention by the Member States , and what
Before I go into more detail , I should like to tell you that this very issue was discussed at the European conference which took place just yesterday in Luxembourg ,
I would just mention the following: two joint actions , from 29 November 1996 and 24 February 1997 , for an exchange programme and measures to combat trafficking in people and the
sexual exploitation of children; extending Europol's mandate to include the prevention of and fight against trafficking in people , as I said before; the 28 April 1997 action plan for fighting
organised crime; the EU-US common initiative against trafficking in women (it seems to us important that this issue has now been taken up in the transatlantic dialogue); and finally the
And are the rumours we sometimes hear in this Parliament true that hundreds of thousands of young girls and children are being brought illegally into the EU from the
Mr President , Mrs Thors , I believe that I have tried to underline how much this Presidency in particular sees this problem as related to the larger one of the fight
On 1-3 October the Austrian Presidency organised a conference in Vienna for eastern and western countries on the trade in women , which the EU Commissioner for Immigration , Home Affairs and
Its aim was to inform the public about the basic and country-specific organisation of trafficking in women , and to offer the representatives of NGOs and of national and international
The conference intends , in the light of international experience , to raise the issue of standards which are in keeping with the times and to look at good examples of measures
It will looked in particular at the situation women are faced with in criminal proceedings when they have become the victims of domestic violence , the specific aspects of violence
against female migrants and their special need for protection because of their legal and economic situation as foreigners , and the impact of each of these on the work of the
I have already explained how important this subject was at the European conference , particularly in view of the need for future EU member countries to find joint solutions to this
My question is , since so much crime goes on through the Internet , can we think about setting up a kind of cyber-police to monitor communication on the Internet and
But at the moment , we are in the process of looking at this in detail with experts , and we hope that either during this Presidency or shortly afterwards , we
Mr President , Mrs Thors , the problem you raised is currently being examined by the Council's services , particularly with a view to obtaining an expert opinion on the questions raised by
On the basis of this review the Council will then judge whether the Commission should be requested to present a proposal on the area referred to in Mrs Thors's
I too am sorry that the Council cannot provide more information , especially since the newspapers have been reporting over the past week that the Member States have sent in their
At this time of economic globalisation the Council is particularly aware that everything must be done in order to maintain the level of employment and if possible to raise
That is why for the time being , I can only reiterate that this is of course an extremely complex and multifaceted problem , which needs to be very closely examined
The President-in-Office referred to what she described as the biggest challenge facing us in the run-up to the millennium: bringing unemployment down for the next generation and providing more
Mr President , Mr Lindqvist , you know that the Austrian Presidency in particular attaches the greatest importance to fighting unemployment , and that we intend to draw up specific guidelines for the
I do not have all the details in front of me right now , but these are primarily based on the best practice , as it is called , of the different
I am thinking here of the great flexibility and mobility in Holland and the Austrian model of 'dual training' which involves both an apprenticeship and vocational school - theory
A very big multinational company - Fruit of the Loom - is pulling out of a labour-intensive industry with thousands of jobs because they want to get the product
I would suggest that the direction to take - if the President-in-Office could comment - is to reduce our income tax and social charges which are too high , thereby
Of course I cannot go into details on this question now - I am not really an expert on these financial negotiations - but I can tell you that
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0333/98) , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , on the common position adopted by the
Council (C4-0340/98-97/0153(COD)) with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Decision adopting a programme of Community action on pollution-related diseases in the context of the framework for action
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have the task of considering the common position established by the Council with a view to adopting a programme of Community action on
In order to understand the exact context in which the amendments may and should be voted on , it is essential to realise that the purpose of this programme is
In this way , we can inform the Member States , which must collect the data , and the citizens of the European Union , so that they are aware of the pollutants
But this programme does not contain anything else , and that is why , to stay within this ambit and to avoid encroaching upon the direct action to combat pollutants and
We had called for the information on pollution-related diseases referred to in Article 1(2)(a) to include clear information on those diseases , a point that has not been incorporated in
But if that is not the case , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection asks , in Amendments Nos 2 and 4 , for the duration of this
Once the programme has had its duration and funding reinstated , we will have to go a stage further , in other words , we will need to conduct coordinated epidemiological studies on
We must also take action to promote knowledge of the behaviour patterns , ways of life and eating habits that make it possible to reduce the risk from various forms
We must also point out that , in the Commission's view , the reference to Article 228 in Article 6 on international cooperation is inappropriate , as the text relates to technical
With regard to follow-up , we call on the European Commission to report to us , in the six months following the adoption of this project , on the measures taken to
We hope , in this way , to provide the final touches to the proposed programme and increase its effectiveness while , finally , stressing that we believe that it is essential for the
At the same time , with a programme like this , we arouse expectations as regards active measures on the part of the EU to deal with pollutants and diseases related
Of course the EU does have a role to play , partly by pledging money for research , partly by facilitating the exchange of experience in the field of health and partly
As regards the programme we are now debating , we can choose between either letting it die of its own accord , which one might easily think is the likely outcome when
For me , this choice is also underpinned by the fact that the patients' associations in the field which carry out work on pollution-related diseases actually consider the programme to
As Mr Cabrol has quite rightly pointed out , the programme does not in itself prevent the emission of pollutants , but it calls attention to the fact that there is a
It is one thing to treat babies with hormone ointments for rashes , but it is another matter to try to locate the link between the rashes and pollution and
Madam President , these programmes aimed at improving the European dimension of public health as always receive the support of Parliament and , in particular , that of the Group of the European
In other words , Parliament should have access - especially in view of the next stage in which this Parliament will have greater legislative power - to the Commission's background
We are all aware that European Union competence in public health policies is of a complementary nature - as stated in the Maastricht Treaty and again in the Treaty of
We are not claiming that these programmes will completely solve the problem , but we do want to ensure that all the entities involved , be they health sectors , regions , or
This gives the impression that the actions that we are going to undertake are at an initial stage when we actually have sufficient information , and the necessary premises exist ,
This is because when they see that all the atmospheric pollution and other forms of pollution that we are suffering from have done more damage in the last 20
Firstly , at first reading I proposed that the Member States should be encouraged to introduce a register of environmentally-related health problems , since this is a phenomenon that is causing
I regret the fact that neither the Council nor the Commission are in favour , and I am surprised to see that the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and
In the context of this particular issue , these diseases appear to act as a kind of warning signal and a point of reference in trying to understand what is happening
We support the amendments on extending the programme to five years and on its complementary funding , and those concerning the need to acquire more overall knowledge and to initiate coordinated
There is no point in carrying out research to find out what pollution is related to pollution-related diseases , and what is causing pollution-related diseases , if these findings are only
The more information available from all quarters , the more the aim of the programme to enable citizens of the European Union to protect themselves as much as possible against pollution
Preventive action must be the primary aim of the programme , but this must be coupled with the recognition of the needs of those who contract the diseases too early
Many diseases , and particularly many cancers , are caused by the presence of pollutants in the air , in water and even in food , without a relation of cause and effect being
This is true for electromagnetic fields , for the microwaves used for mobile telephones , for the glutamate used in food and also for the agricultural chemicals that have caused human
The effects of pollution not only contribute to the manifestation of respiratory diseases , but extend to disorders of other systems which can become apparent after prolonged exposure and as a
Indeed , if we bear in mind that we are not at risk from just one harmful factor but from many simultaneously , then we can surmise that their cumulative effect may
The quality of nutrition is also inseparably related to the content of various chemical compounds in foods , and a systematic study is needed of the consequences of food pollution ,
On the basis of the exchanges of information and experience which it is proposed should take place between the Member States , I am confident that new and useful data will
This is bound to bring action which will include the dissemination of the data , and information of the public and consumers , as mentioned in Amendments Nos 10 , 14 and
Madam President , after the decision on health monitoring , for which I myself was rapporteur , and the one on the network for the epidemiological surveillance of communicable diseases , also tabled by
Professor Cabrol , this decision , adopting a programme of Community action on pollution-related diseases , sets out to provide the Member States with a catalogue of data relating to diseases caused by
In the short time available to me , I merely wish to say that I can endorse in full Mr Cabrol's excellent report , and I hope that the 16 amendments seeking
This is an initial step towards the adoption of more ambitious programmes in the increasingly tough fight against growing pollution in our society , which has such an impact on
It is therefore necessary to complement our actions on emission controls and exporter limits with activities in the area of public health aimed at reducing the health risk caused
Amendment No 6 is not considered workable with the timing envisaged; in broad terms its objective is covered by the general obligation on the Commission to ensure complementarity and
Amendment No 11 cannot be accepted because the nature of the duration and , indeed , the financial resources and the scope of the programme do not allow for the support
We are now going to make the best use of this programme , and put together all the benefits of the research so that we can move into the mainstream
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0336/98) , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , on the common position adopted by the
Council (C4-0341/98-97/0146(COD)) with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Decision adopting a programme of Community action on rare diseases within the framework for action in the field
Research by the pharmaceutical industry is utterly inadequate: in these cases the profit motive obviously does not apply for pharmaceutical firms , given that the market for these drugs is
Hence the importance , from a humanitarian and health point of view , of the programme of Community action on rare diseases , which is one of the proposals being made in
At our first reading , the European Parliament considered this action programme to be of undoubted benefit , and greatly improved it through 28 amendments , which among other things provided for the
Very few of the suggestions contained in the amendments tabled at first reading were accepted by the Council: of the 28 adopted by this House , the Council took up
Here , as in other sectors , we must centralise the gathering of up-to-date data and all necessary information as to the development , number and clusters of cases of the rare
We are pleased with the Council's decision to fund the programme for the entire five-year period , bearing in mind that the original proposal provided for funding for the first year
It is true that similar mixed committees are envisaged in other public health programmes , but in this specific one , considering the type of measures intended , we find the position
We are therefore retabling the amendment concerning the requirement that one of the two representatives nominated to the committee by each Member State be a representative from a patients' help
Further , it is very important to involve specialist doctors and general practitioners; the latter can make a vital contribution , since they are the families' first port of call and
In essence , therefore , your rapporteur is inviting the House to reiterate the position expressed at first reading , by approving all the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment , Public
Madam President , there is probably no one among us who has not , at least once , had to listen with great regret and a touch of shame to reports of the
solitary conditions experienced by patients , but also their families , who are afflicted by these diseases , the rarity of which entails difficulties , delays and sometimes even initial errors in diagnosis , as
For this reason , on the basis of Mr Viceconte's excellent report and amendments , the European Parliament has merely sought to strengthen the Commission's proposal in a few respects: in
particular concerning centralised data collection , training and information for health workers and patients' families , the funding of the programme , as well as the involvement of patients' families , their associations and ,
It is always very upsetting , Commissioner , when the European Union chooses to save money on the health of its citizens , but whereas this is true in all cases it
The Party of European Socialists , on whose behalf I have the honour of speaking , lends its full support to the Viceconte report and to all the amendments adopted in
And for our part , we believe that the Commission is aware that with a proposal of this type , which is aimed at tackling a very scattered problem - and
this is precisely the reason why it does not have any sponsors - , we need coordination at all levels , and all aspects will certainly need to be examined in depth
Similarly , I believe that a flexible approach to the application of these programmes would enable the Commission , through its three main lines of action - informing people , helping patients' support
We will therefore have to bring all the patients together and concentrate our efforts on these two issues - which , in my opinion , are essential - , leaving aside the
And we are prepared to support it because he was very flexible in the debate and discussion on his draft report and accepted all the amendments tabled by the
As Mr Poggiolini says , out of a total of 28 amendments , only two were totally accepted and four partially accepted And the rapporteur is perfectly right - and in
We are always aware that money is scarce , but if a programme is set up to address these rare diseases and does not receive sufficient funding , it will not
And fourthly , we need to encourage the participation of non-governmental organisations and of relatives who experience at first hand the seriousness of a patient's disease and the difficulties he has
This is not simply because we do not have accurate statistics about the number of people suffering from rare diseases , but even more so because there is a complete
The programme's objectives are , firstly , to improve the data , information and knowledge concerning rare diseases; secondly , to reinforce the teams that provide assistance; and , thirdly , to create a rapid-reaction
Rare diseases form a sensitive category because each of them affects just a certain number of people and , because of the impacts and social consequences to which they give rise ,
It is also essential to support measures which encourage and promote the provision of information to doctors and health science professionals , so as to improve the early diagnosis , recognition ,
An essential factor for the coordination of these efforts is to create a network for the monitoring and control of rare diseases , which will provide data and information to the
Madam President , I should like to thank Mr Viceconte for his efforts , Mr Poggiolini for standing in for him this evening and all the members of the committee who helped
The low prevalence of these diseases and the limited means for scientific research into them make it less likely that swift progress will be made in their diagnosis , treatment
However , they are far from insignificant either in human or economic terms , and providing effective advice and diagnosis in health intervention tends to cost disproportionately more than similar provisions for
The Commission has proposed that the programme would run for the five years with three targets , namely , to provide knowledge about rare diseases especially for patients and their relatives , health
We have in place an effective system of monitoring in order to ensure the rapid identification , assessment and handling of rare diseases and disease clusters , and they would be
This is consistent with ongoing activities in biomedical research , and with the recent proposal for a regulation on orphan medicinal products used for the treatment , prevention or diagnosis of these
Since then the Council has adopted a common position on the programme which reflects fully only some of the amendments from the first reading , but the Commission has entered a
As regards the 20 amendments under consideration today , the Commission can accept 11 either fully - that is Nos 3 , 12 and 16 - or , partially - Nos 1 ,
Of the remaining nine amendments , Nos 4 , 8 and 13 are not acceptable for legal reasons; Nos 5 and 20 are not acceptable for internal consistency; Nos 2 and
On the point raised by Mr Poggiolini , Mrs Marinucci and Mrs Gonzalez Alvarez concerning the database , the wording of the common position does not exclude the possibility of creating
The next item is the report (A4-0334/98) by Mr Whitehead , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , on the proposal for a European Parliament
When the historians look back on the fourth elected Parliament and its relations with the Commission between 1994 and 1999 , I think there will be a significant chapter on consumer
It will cover the hideous tragedy of the BSE crisis , which brought Parliament to the brink of a vote of no-confidence in the Commission on issues of public health
It will see the establishment of a firm legal base as a framework for consumer protection , and as a necessary entrenchment in an area where , as we all know ,
I say to Commissioner Monti that a healthy countervailing power is a thing that , more than anything else , will make the single market not only efficient but also an informed
I also want to thank some very staunch allies , some of them present here today in Parliament: the representative on the Committee on Budgets of our own committee , Mr
Much has already been imperilled by the lack of a legal base after the European Court of Justice ruling , including the special measures with regard to food safety , which
As my report states , we are dealing here with only one-quarter of one percent of Community spending and yet this , unlike a good deal of other Community spending , directly benefits
But I think it would be grossly irresponsible for this Parliament and for its partners in the Union to approach the budget for the next five years without at
least an apprehension that these responsibilities will come to the Council - the heart of what was agreed at Amsterdam , taking consumers' interests into account across the broad range of
It is a common feature of the opinion of Mr Pimenta and of my own report that we note that the traditional role of the Commission in supporting activities within
the Member States - particularly those in the south of Europe where consumer movements have not been widely developed - has been imperiled by the transfer of resources needed by
BSE has already loaded a very heavy burden on DG XXIV and on the Commission as a whole in terms of the expanded inspectorate and the information campaigns that it
That is not there for some grandiose increase in spending or empire-building , but simply to maintain both the Commission's well-proven support for consumer movements and the new responsibilities in
I particularly commend to the House Amendment No 16 from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection which added the provision that access to justice for the
I hope the Council can also accept the strongly-held view of Parliament that a starting budget of ECU 24 million in 1999 , rising in the proportions set out in Agenda
I should like to say not only to Commissioner Monti , but also to the Member States and the Council - to all of them , including my own: do not betray
Above all , do not claim to be consumer champions , with glossy leaflets and public clamour , unless you have the civil courage to sustain in private what you commend in
Second , how can we overcome the crisis of confidence on the part of European consumers towards European institutions , particularly as regards the Council and the Commission , brought about by the
Lastly , the recognition of the vital role of non-governmental organisations and the clarification of rules under which they are given assistance or contracts are concluded with them (Amendments Nos 17
I consider that the budgetary framework which the Commission presents for executing such an ambitious project is not adequate and , therefore , in this regard , in the context of Agenda
2000 and in the preparation of policies up to 2006 , the Commission must review the budget if it wishes to have a consumer policy that is supported by 320 million
Consumers are justifiably puzzled by the suspension of funding , as ordered by the recent Court of Justice ruling , and the programmes intended to consolidate consumer organisations in Spain , Italy ,
Article 129a of the Maastricht Treaty and then Article 153 of the Amsterdam Treaty set out certain actions , which however are not sufficient unless a programme of priority measures is
This framework at last makes it possible to have a legal base for promoting actions in the interests of consumers , allowing for a budget line amounting to ECU 114
The actions which are possible with this financial support range across four sectors: consumer health and safety , the protection of consumers' economic interests in respect of goods and services , consumer
We often forget that the five-year period 1999-2003 will be a particularly important and difficult one for consumers , who find themselves facing challenges such as the advent of the single
In conclusion , consumers will need to be provided with adequate means of assessing risks and taking legal action where necessary , in other words monitoring and inspection will need to be
The amount of work that needs to be done out of this budget is enormous , ranging from research to investigation to ensure that adequate legal redress be available when
Give the billions of pounds spent by consumers every year on a vast array of products and services , the ECU 130m being sought in this report is a very small
The Commission's decision to go for transport and public health seems a sensible one , in that it is based on experience from the last few years and also fits
The increase from ECU 114 million to ECU 130 million which the rapporteur proposes in Amendment No 14 is far too little to be able to cover all areas of
Part of this must be earmarked for defending consumers' interests when the euro is launched , and here I agree with the rapporteur: these interests can best be defended by
Madam President , the Whitehead report discusses how European consumers are to be protected when the euro is introduced and how the Union is to deal with existing concerns over the
I think that the BSE crisis has taught us that we must adopt the precautionary principle when it comes to food , in other words also take measures even when it
I am , however , opposed in principle to increasing the budgetary provision in the proposal from ECU 114 million over five years to ECU 130 million , which the rapporteur is
We must of course be exacting in our demands on safety , but we must also allow the consumers to use their power - which is now considerable - to take
Madam President , we must strike a blow for consumers , not because some elsewhere might think that the European Parliament lacks faith in itself , but because the consumers' interests need to
As a justification for the legislative proposal , the Commission states that the purpose of the general framework is to make it possible for consumers' interests to be taken more
I am surprised that the Commission then only gives public health , research and transport as examples and does not mention the integration of consumer concerns into areas such as
And it must also be remembered that it is often the EU , rather than the consumers' organisations themselves , that wants to launch various campaigns , and that in this context
Hence it is not reasonable to ask the organisations to cover as much as 50 % of the cost themselves , certainly not when the campaigns are an EU priority
Also we find it unacceptable that the administrative part of the EU's consumer campaigns is often so complex that it demands an incredible amount of patience for the staff of
There is also a tendency to forget that the EU's campaigns derive great benefit from the credibility and reliability of the national and European consumers' organisations , but that the
Finally , having said that , I would like to thank Philip Whitehead because , once again and - as usual - in an excellent report , he has struck a blow for consumers'
Madam President , I am particularly pleased that Mr Monti is here with us this evening: as we are all aware , he is the Commissioner responsible for the single market -
The needs of this single market , encompassing 370 million citizens in their capacity as consumers , must increasingly be taken into account by all the Community institutions; we must keep
We very much agree with the call for increased funding , voiced by the rapporteur and strongly endorsed by Mr Pimenta: these improvements are merely a recognition of the new circumstances
We can call him client , user or whatever we will , but the consumer remains king: it is he who , in a changing market , in the public and private spheres ,
constantly demands new or improved products , calls for simpler and less dangerous packaging , seeks more information on what he is consuming , clearer labels , eco-friendly and less polluting materials and , finally ,
Their children might practise a different occupation from their parents , perhaps in a different country , but undoubtedly on a scale which is no longer just national but at least
It is our duty to brief consumers exhaustively on the advent of the single currency , on the one hand to train businesses , and on the other to inform the
Only yesterday , during the discussion on the euro , I requested that the issuing of the 500 euro banknote be postponed by one year , because it could cause substantial difficulties
During this period there has been no basic legal act geared to financing such action , nor a formal description of activities eligible for funding , with the sole exception of
In the light of continuing European integration , it clearly becomes necessary to assure the citizens of the Union , in their capacity as consumers , that their rights and interests will be
Indeed , it would be impossible to predict with accuracy , on a five-year basis , all the problem areas in which the Community needs to intervene for the purposes of consumer
Following the Court of Justice ruling last May , rapid adoption of this proposal has become necessary , given that , in the absence of a legal base for the expenditure , most of
I wish in particular to thank the rapporteur , Mr Whitehead , for his excellent report , for his constructive work and for the way in which he has managed to accelerate
Almost all of Parliament's amendments are acceptable to the Commission , and incidentally I would thank the rapporteur for having extended the indicative list of activities , notably in respect of consumers'
However Amendments Nos 12 and 16 , on the adaptation of this decision to the Amsterdam Treaty after its entry into force - amendments with which , I must say , I
I can nevertheless undertake here and now to present to the Commission , as soon as the Treaty enters into force , a proposal taking account of the implications of the
As regards Amendment No 13 , on the financial allocation , the Commission will provide Parliament and the Council with all necessary technical assistance to enable them to reach an early agreement
I would merely point out - and I do so more to the Council than to the European Parliament - that , once the financial allocation has been set , its
adaptation to the implications of the Amsterdam Treaty would seem rather unlikely; therefore the financial allocation must take account , as of now , of the new activities which will result from
As I have already said , Parliament and the Council have undertaken to speed up the decision-making procedure for the adoption of the proposals which constitute the legal base providing
I would like to end by reiterating my thanks to all those who have spoken: their comments will be fully taken into account when the new three-year action plan to
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0325/98) , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights , on the common position adopted by the Council (C4-0421/98-97/0198(COD))
Madam President , with this recommendation for second reading of the directive on the legal protection of encrypted services which we are considering today , we are taking the penultimate step so
The loss of income for encrypted services exceeds ECU 200 million per year and the effect on the European film industry is truly appalling , since 34 % of its
In any event , it is enough to mention that , in just four months , there have been on the celebrated Internet over a million advertisements for illicit pirate devices , just
These are activities which militate against the proper operation of our internal market , impeding the further development of industries specialising in new technologies and the development of new means of
Designing more sophisticated decoders with more powerful features offering increased protection in order to combat piracy has been shown to be both costly and ultimately ineffectual , because the pirate industry
The Commission and the European Parliament in the first instance , but then the Council too , have shown that they understand the urgent need for this measure , because piracy has not
Between the Commission's Green Paper and the second reading of the draft directive , which Parliament called for following my first report in May 1992 , only two years have gone
The rental and distribution of illicit devices have been added to the illicit activities , and the factor of addition has been established in the new explanatory concept 21 by
In its amendments , Parliament had asked for the protection of conditional access , with the aim of providing more general protection of the economic value of the services and not
The disagreement could have become more acute and prolonged if Commissioner Monti had not given an undertaking to authorise a study to ascertain whether it would be appropriate to
Following that undertaking , which brings the prospect of more extensive protection in the future , your rapporteur felt that there was no need to resubmit the amendments tabled by Parliament at
With Amendment No 2 to Article 7 , I thought it preferable to keep the door open for a later stage and generally to make things easier for the Council ,
Madam President , as the rapporteur , Mr Anastassopoulos , said , Parliament's main concern was to fill a legal vacuum , and we must bear in mind that the three institutions have worked very
Consequently , in only one year and two weeks , this directive , which is aimed , as the rapporteur said , at combating piracy in information society services , television and radio broadcasting , etcetera ,
As Mr Anastassopoulos said , we have chosen to close the matter for now , but have left open the option of carrying out a short-term review through Amendment No 2 ,
And , apart from Amendment No 2 , which is aimed at quickly rectifying any inadequacies , the Committee on Legal Affairs has also tabled Amendment No 1 that refers to the
I think that the three institutions are carrying out some good work and as always - as Commissioner Monti is well aware - the Committee on Legal Affairs has been
We must , of course , remember that we are dealing with the protection of certain fundamental rights , such as the right to information , which is , moreover , compatible with the exercise of
Madam President , I should like to begin - and this is not just rhetoric - by congratulating the rapporteur on behalf of my group , the Group of the European People's
The market for conditional-access services is growing rapidly due to digital technology , but such growth may be threatened by the equally rapid development of piracy , a parallel industry -
Apart from harming the industry , to paraphrase the rapporteur , this piracy has a number of adverse effects , not only in terms of the loss of income from subscriptions to
Furthermore , it will mean higher prices and less choice for the consumer , who is often the victim of fraud because he is not told where the pirated device he
So , in simpler terms , this proposal for a directive is an instrument that is both necessary and useful to combat one of the many facets - but a very
Rather , its purpose is limited to those services that depend on previous authorisation aimed at guaranteeing the remuneration of the service , as well as services provided on the basis
This limited field of application - as highlighted by the rapporteur - gave rise to a fruitful debate , an interactive debate - if you will pardon the pun - ,
As a result of this interaction , Parliament accepts the arguments put forward by the Commission , which advise against including the broader concept of economic value as a protected legal
Tomorrow we shall vote in favour of the Commission and the Council's approach and , in this case , we will support the argument that the legal instrument would lose some
By accepting this , the House understands that the Commission has committed itself to immediately initiating the necessary proceedings to ensure that those other services that are rendered without payment are
As far as these services are concerned , there is no doubt that criminal activities also damage an interest that can be legally protected , and this , in the last analysis ,
The text of the common position contains clear improvements , not only because it follows the guidelines of the first reading report drawn up by this Parliament in its capacity
At the same time , a number of gaps have been filled , such as the inclusion of activities relating to the renting and distribution of illicit devices among those activities
We must also be pleased with the fact that , for example , difficult , specific and overly technical expressions , such as the seizure of illicit devices , that in some systems -
for example , the Spanish system - would be difficult to implement from the transposition of the directive , have been replaced by more generic forms , such as the removal of illicit
This now appears in the text and is being introduced under the premise that each Member State will adopt it in accordance with the structures of their own legal
This addition must not , in any case , modify the concept of civil responsibility that in all our legal systems is of an objective nature , in other words , independent of
Secondly I wish to take up the serious matter - in the light of information we have recently received - that it is not just the French but also the
It is really my hope that this will form part of the work to create an area of peace , security and freedom which we have been talking about since
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin by thanking the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs , and in particular the rapporteur , Mr Anastassopoulos , for their alacrity
As stated in the report explaining the reasons for the recommendation , the Commission has undertaken to conduct a study to investigate the use of conditional access techniques for purposes other
The call for tenders for this study was published in the Official Journal of 10 July 1998 , and I am happy to announce that the administrative preparations for the
Therefore the Commission welcomes Parliament's second amendment , designed to create a legal base to allow for periodical adaptations of the directive and in particular of the definitions under Article 2 ,
The first amendment introduces a new recital which helps to clarify the aims of the directive; it reflects the content of Amendment No 10 tabled at first reading , which was
The Commission will defend the new modified proposal in the Council , taking account of the European Parliament's amendments , in an attempt to convince the Council to draw the appropriate
Once again , Madam President , I thank Mr Anastassopoulos and all those who have cooperated in what we really can describe as a further example of rapid and successful interaction between
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0319/98) , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights , on the common position adopted by the Council (C4-0422/98-96/0031(COD))
with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Directive establishing a mechanism for the recognition of qualifications in respect of the professional activities covered by the Directives on
That made it easier to reach a result that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights could approve unanimously , which creates the best basis for making the necessary amendments
In Article 3(1) , the Council provides that , in case of doubt , evidence can be provided by an adaptation period or an aptitude test , at the choice of the host
An individual who wants to settle and work in another country can work out for himself how to provide evidence of adequate professional qualifications that fulfil the host country's
Article 8a on freedom of movement provides that every citizen of the Union shall have the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States ,
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , operators in the commercial , industrial and craft sectors will soon receive recognition , from the Member State in which they intend to establish themselves , of qualifications
What we are about to approve at second reading is an across-the-board system of recognition , according to the recognition mechanism referred to by the Court of Justice in the
This complements Directives 89/48/EEC and 92/51/EEC , the first relating to university degrees and the second to vocational training , which are currently being updated to incorporate the Glassopoulo case law
Before authorising someone to operate in the industrial , commercial or craft sectors , the Member State concerned will have to conduct a comparison of the knowledge and skills certified by
If there are differences between the training provided in the Member State of origin and in the host Member State , the migrant worker must prove that he has acquired
In its common position , the Council states that the host Member State should have this choice , albeit taking account of the migrant's preference , but the Committee on Legal Affairs
There are two reasons for this: the administrative difficulties encountered by people wishing to obtain recognition of their qualifications in another Member State , which would be further compounded; and
the need to keep a parallel between this directive and the general system of recognition of qualifications , already established through Directives 89/48 and 92/51 , which give the migrant worker the
I believe that the decision to abide by the codecision procedure already laid down for the body of the directive is correct , because aspects of a legal nature which
Finally , in complimenting Mrs Gebhardt on her work , I hope that the Council of Ministers will take on board the points raised by the European Parliament , and that the directive
Madam President , Commissioner , supplementing the recognition system for examination certificates is essential to increase the free movement of citizens and to improve standards of equality among them and safeguard their
The issue concerns not only the movement of skilled and professional people , but also the participation of students and young people in educational and exchange programmes and the wish
But at the same time , there has to be an awareness that the education programme must also include the recognition of examinations passed and qualifications gained in another Member
The Commission should now look very closely into the experience gained from the application of the recognition system and the possible practical problems that exist , and embark on the further
It may well be that the Chamber is not very full at this hour , yet for all its simplicity - and because of its simplicity - this directive really
And for three reasons: it is a tremendous simplification; it directly affects the people's Europe; and it relates more particularly to mobility of labour , which is so important in
As we are only too well aware , in Europe , unlike the United States , we shall always have the factor of language diversity - and would certainly not wish to
The amendment granting the migrant the right to choose between an aptitude test and an adaptation course is acceptable to the Commission , as it is designed to facilitate freedom
This directive is important because it not only simplifies Community law by merging 35 directives into a single text , but also extends recognition to qualifications for certain occupations which
I would also recall that , very logically in my view , this proposal has received the support of Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , as a contribution to combating unemployment ,
Martin , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights , on the draft Council Decision amending Council Decision 88/591/ECSC , EEC , Euratom establishing the Court of First Instance
In essence the proposal before us today is that certain types of cases , primarily those that raise non-complex legal issues , should be heard by a single judge instead of
This item was very controversial and the vote ended in a dead heat the first time we voted on it , eight Members voting in favour , eight against and four
For example , an Italian judge who consistently gave judgments in a particular way against his colleagues might wrongly be impugned as having a national interest in his or her
In the end the committee voted in favour of this proposal because we had no other concrete proposals in front of us to improve the speed at which the Court
Neverthless , that leaves us with a significant problem and no one on the committee - whether for or against the proposal - believed this was the ultimate solution to
The committee has suggested that in the future we should be looking at the possibility of increasing the number of judges in the Court of First Instance , improving the staff
So , although in the end we have decided to come out in favour of this proposal , it is with some reservations and it is with a view that this will
Madam President , the absence of Ms Mosiek-Urbahn this evening leaves me with the honourable but difficult task of presenting the majority position of the Group of the European People's Party
in favour of the Council's proposal for a decision to enable the Court of First Instance to operate under a single judge , even though I personally have a number of
I would now like to make particular reference to the excellent speech given by the rapporteur , which is simply a culmination of the way in which this complicated and controversial
I should firstly like to highlight the fact that the vote by the Group of the European People's Party in favour of the proposal - and I do not
doubt that the House will vote the same way tomorrow - is proof of its confidence in the Court and those who work there , given that our competence is limited
However , it is very difficult to assess the legislative proposal without considering the amendments to the Rules of Procedure , including future amendments , since they will determine the circumstances under which
I would stress the fact that Parliament will tomorrow be signing a blank check whose content and possible expiry date will be the sole responsibility of the Court and the
The Group of the European People's Party welcomes , shares and encourages the concern over budgetary efficiency that this measure has generated since , according to the best estimates , the total
The argument put forward by the distinguished judges is also relevant as it states that the biggest threat to the Court's legitimacy is the slowness inherent in the running of
And throughout its history there has certainly been no shortage of proof of the opportunities for the Presidents of the Chamber after they have fulfilled their role of assigning
Allow me now , Madam President , to speak on behalf of those of us who have reservations about this solution , that we shall express tomorrow through a constructive disagreement with the
An attempt to offset a critical situation - a situation that looks set to worsen with the imminent arrival of trademark litigation - by increasing the number of cases
It is not a matter of mistrusting anyone , less still the institution itself , but who would deny that a joint , plural ruling , at least at the present stage of
Who would also deny the fact that since the times of Ancient Greece one of the functions of the collegiate has been to integrate into one body those that ,
in the end , must always speak with one voice , with the same voice , and with the coherent voice of all those who come from very different backgrounds and who have
And lastly , would it not be understandable , predictable even , that , in the face of collapse and the lack of solutions , the Court and the Council - since , as we have
This would undoubtedly constitute a saving but only in the very short term and it would not take into account the social cost - in addition to the economic
And finally Madam President , to paraphrase Churchill , justice is expensive , but if the European Union is to fight for one thing , it should in fact fight to build a Europe
A congress was recently held here in France , a political congress , at which the Community legal system was ferociously attacked with claims that , for example , Community justice no longer works
I therefore hope , Commissioner , like David Martin , that you will give serious attention to this question of the functioning of the courts in the forthcoming IGC , preferably as soon
For my part , I will endeavour to ensure that it becomes an objective for the Finnish Presidency , since this is important in holding together a Community based on the
Madam President , Commissioner , even as one who is well aware of the reservations about introducing single judge decisions by the Court of First Instance put forward during the discussion in
the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights , and has now heard them repeated , let me on behalf of my group plead for adoption of the Martin report , now that
My other reason is , I believe , the most important one , and perhaps I can remind you of it even at this near-midnight hour: the European Union has to prepare
This is a cause for concern , particularly in view of the litigation likely to result from the application of Regulation No 40/94 of 20 December 1993 on the Community
Referral of a case to a judge-rapporteur , as a single judge , would moreover be optional and confined to situations determined in the Rules of Procedure , with the decision taken
In any event , as proposed by Mrs Mosiek-Urbahn in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights , the impact of this measure should be assessed three years after its entry
Finally , in thanking Mr Martin for his valuable work , I would say that I am in favour of the proposal but look forward to seeing other more comprehensive and
Reading the introduction to your draft resolution , on which I compliment Mr Martin , I note that our reactions to the proposal from the Court of First Instance and the
In a Community based on the rule of law , it is vital that judges should be able to perform their duties within a reasonable time-span; otherwise the citizens' backing
If I am to be guided by the main argument put forward by the ECJ and CFI , in other words the huge increase in the volume of litigation concerning
In that case , why lay down as of now the composition of the judiciary body for litigation the actual scale of which no one yet knows , especially as -
As the Court itself acknowledges , the single judge will have only a marginal impact on efficiency , since such judges will only be able to handle cases considered to be
At the same time , however , is it reasonable to ease the CFI's workload to such a marginal extent by introducing , without further reflection , a reform as far-reaching as the
Indeed , it strikes the Commission as extremely hazardous to seek to transfer to the Community's legal system solutions adopted in the Member States , in other words in homogeneous settings ,
Obviously , there are some minor cases , such as disputes concerning annual staff reports , or certain cases , such as those mentioned by the ECJ concerning milk quotas or customs agents ,
They relate to litigation over trade marks and plant varieties which , for the reasons already given , cannot as of now be regarded as suitable for consideration by a single
The same applies to public service litigation in general: such litigation , which draws its solutions from various general rules and principles of the Community's legal order , cannot in the
Finally , appeals in cases concerning the non-contractual liability of the Community are involved here , as are all manner of other cases which , on the strength of somewhat vague and subjective
In any event , and irrespective of any changes which might be made to the proposal from the ECJ and CFI , the Commission believes that it is premature to adopt ,
Indeed , once the principle of the single judge has been adopted , and in the absence of any other reform of the CFI , the CFI will inevitably be tempted to
Under these circumstances , the Commission considers that the most urgent issue is not so much that of the single judge , but of conducting a thorough reform of the Community legal
The Court of Justice should not forget that it too is experiencing certain difficulties , and that it will soon be faced with competences deriving from the Amsterdam Treaty , particularly
The Commission therefore believes that it was imperative to appoint a group of wise persons to launch a joint process of reflection with the ECJ as soon as possible ,

Mrs Jensen on draft amending budget 2/2005
Are there any comments
Mr Hans-Peter Martin would like to make a comment
the debate on the Members‚Äô Statute , or to stop it going ahead
The vote on it is not even announced in tomorrow‚Äôs agenda
would send completely the wrong message if we were to adopt a Members‚Äô Statute while accumulating privileges on the quiet
That is no way to treat a democratic people‚Äôs Chamber
without being compromised by this House adopting a new package of privileges at the same time
Having studied paragraph 2 of Rule 132 with the assistance and advice of the services of the House , I can see no reason to grant your request
statement ‚Äì Work of the Luxembourg Presidency
Both items will be debated jointly
To this end , the President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Juncker , will take the floor first

Mr President , Mr Barroso , ladies and gentlemen , the Luxembourg Presidency is drawing to an end
Some will say ‚Äòthank goodness‚Äô , but personally I am sorry it is ending and I should have liked to continue
The time has come to assess the results
A number of observations can be made which I hope are undisputed
controversial
We reformed the Stability and Growth Pact , thereby ending a long period of uncertainty which had the potential to trigger a profound rift among the euro-zone Member States
Far from eliminating stability , we have added stability to the preventive aspects of the Pact
Nor have we introduced excessive flexibility as regards the Pact‚Äôs corrective role , but instead have made it read and feel more economic than automatic
vital dimensions , namely stability , combined with growth , and growth allied to stability
Secondly , Parliament , the Commission and Council have been successful in giving fresh impetus to the Lisbon strategy
jobs and competitiveness
Hello
I know people often react to my speeches
The reaction is not usually quite so immediate
To come back to the Lisbon strategy: we are changing the way it is applied
and European commitment
last few days
ones‚Äô
Thirdly , Mr President , we successfully set new targets for public development aid on a European Union level
After confirming that the European cooperation effort has to be stepped up to 0
70% of our national wealth by 2015 , we set an intermediate goal for the European Union of 0
56% of national wealth by 2010
I take a degree of pride in that decision , because I knew at the beginning of the year that it was a vexed and controversial one
from 2010 , an extra EUR 20 billion per annum
It is not perfect , but it is a significant step
times
Having successfully banished slavery in the 19th century , we must be able to eliminate poverty during the first half of the 21st century
Fourthly and lastly , Mr President , as promised on 12 January when I presented the programme for the Luxembourg Presidency , we have improved our relations with our US partner
This was clear at the meeting on 22 February 2005 here in Brussels with President Bush , who had expressed a desire to come over to Europe
It was also clear during Monday‚Äôs summit between President Barroso and President Bush
I would also mention that on Sunday we had another summit ‚Äì this time with Canada
We do not devote enough attention to Canada , an important ally for the European Union
Canada is also part of North America
To come back to Monday‚Äôs summit: we confirmed the vital need for both Europe and the USA to stand shoulder to shoulder on the basis of shared convictions
Today , a conference on Iraq is being held in Brussels , as we proposed to President Bush at our meeting on 22 February
subject as contentious as Iraq , the European Union and United States of America would one day be able to work together to help establish lasting democracy and freedom in Iraq
I take some pride in having managed to assist Americans and Europeans to develop a common focus and strategy for Iraq
We should therefore congratulate ourselves on this outcome
I see that your applause is particularly lukewarm on this issue
feet claiming that the Presidency should acknowledge its grave failure on a key aspect of foreign relations
Similarly , Mr President , we reached agreement with neighbouring Russia on what is commonly called the ‚Äòfour spaces‚Äô
Our relations with Russia , which have been so important since the 10 May summit , have warmed considerably
This is a source of satisfaction , although we have to acknowledge that differences of opinion still remain
perspectives by the end of June 2005
On 12 January 2005 , only three weeks later , I was standing before you in Strasbourg assessing the chances of reaching an agreement
At the time I said ‚Äì and I hope you will allow me to quote; you know I love to quote myself:
‚ÄòWe shall do all we can to reach an agreement , but I am not under any illusions
The Member States are currently entrenched in their positions and it will be difficult to move them from those positions in time‚Äô
I was right , and I added ‚Äì to quote myself again: ‚ÄòThe absence of an agreement in June will not be the Presidency‚Äôs failure‚Ä¶
it will be Europe‚Äôs failure‚Äô
Here I was not right ‚Äì or rather I was not entirely right
Member States , in its entirety
Others claim that the disagreement is not a failure for Europe because agreements on the financial perspectives are always achieved at the eleventh hour
normal circumstances , coming as it did amid the uncertainty stirred up by the French and Dutch referenda , plunged us into a profound crisis
It is clear that those responsible for it will tell you there is no crisis
However , my view is that the crisis is a profound one , because it is not purely financial or budgetary
Let us get things in the right order
period 2007-2013 , a budget for commitment appropriations totalling 1
056% of national wealth , and a budget for payment appropriations equal to 1% of national wealth
I have the impression that this level is now generally accepted by all Member States
That is now a given , and you will see that any future compromise will only differ fractionally from that level of expenditure
If all that happens in the future is that we advance by that fraction , I would have preferred us to have reached a decision last week
All my colleagues in the European Council came to Luxembourg between 30 May and 12 June , from 8
30 a
m
until 10
30 p
m
I spent 50 hours negotiating the financial perspectives with them
consultation , debate and negotiations
Quite honestly , we could not have done more , and , quite honestly , those coming after us will do less
During those 50 hours of debate , which I must say were amicable and bilateral , I listened to my colleagues carefully
No one , and I mean no one , demanded that the British rebate be kept as it is ‚Äì no one
In its last proposal for a final compromise , the Luxembourg Presidency upheld the principle of the British rebate: our last proposal was not that it should be frozen
same Member States
This adjustment would have been the equivalent of an annual rebate of EUR 5
5 billion , a higher level than that for the whole of the period 1984-2005
Initially , the Presidency had proposed freezing the British rebate at EUR 4
particular , which were felt to be excessive
Since you are always demanding transparency , I shall give you transparency
per annum
contribution by EUR 1 billion and alleviate the burden on Sweden and Germany
rebate sufficiently
position of the other Member States
So , if the Presidency‚Äôs original proposal had been accepted , the problem of the Netherlands , Germany and Sweden would have been solved easily
The Presidency‚Äôs final proposal , for a level of EUR 5
as normal , with the exception of the common agricultural policy , on which , as we know , the UK has its own particular opinions
It is both as simple and as complicated as that
If only the Six who , in a moment of inspiration , wrote a joint letter , could have agreed on the details of their proposals
which the European budget can meet the Union's future challenges and the priorities of our citizens
This general reflection should lead to a reform of all aspects of the budget‚Äô
‚ÄòAll aspects of the budget‚Äô also include the common agricultural policy
by other Member States
decision
during the European Council meetings
Incidentally , it is normal for the Commission President to attend this type of consultation
possible adjustments to the financial perspectives for the period 2007‚Äì2013‚Äô
the Council with possible changes to the financial perspectives for the later years , namely from 2009 onwards
I wanted to tell you this because no one has yet provided this explanation and you are likely to be hearing a different one soon
It is not true that the Presidency was seeking to kill off the British rebate
We sought to maintain it for the 15-nation Europe , but to increase the impact in terms of solidarity for the new Member States
That was the package that was rejected
It was a mistake to reject it
2002
myself for the 15 ‚Äì a risk moreover widely shared by the others who were happy to have found someone to take a soundly-based initiative on behalf of the 15
figure to EUR 35 billion in 2013
would have meant a reduction of close to 17% for the common agricultural policy alone
in question
To say that nothing was done to lighten the burden of the common agricultural policy is simply untrue
We did everything possible to achieve it
In October 1985 , when I presented my first budget to Parliament here ‚Äì the one for 1986 ‚Äì agriculture accounted for 68% of the European budget
I proposed that it should not exceed 37% , or EUR 35 billion , in 2013
What a long way we have come
What obstinacy in being unable to see it
Under the Presidency‚Äôs proposal , the CAP would have been the only sector where expenditure fell considerably , while , for instance , all forward-looking investment would have increased
A rise of 7
5% in expenditure on the Lisbon goals: 7
5% per annum for the whole period 2007‚Äì2013 , representing an increase of 65% in appropriations for the Lisbon goals as compared to 2006
An increase of 15% for policies in the field of justice and home affairs , including , in particular , increasing the effectiveness of action to combat cross-border crime
Finally , a 2% increase in cohesion policies for the 27 countries , with a greater concentration on the new Member States
to the new Member States , compared to 47% in the Commission‚Äôs proposal
To argue that the bulk of the effort , in our proposal , would have fallen on the shoulders of the old Member States is simply not true
Then we come , Mr President , to a comparison of the research budget with that of the common agricultural policy , and vice versa
We cannot compare apples and pears
Why try to compare when a comparison is impossible
The common agricultural policy is the sole true Community policy financed exclusively from the European budget
Research is , first and foremost , a national policy , supported by the Community budget
The two cannot be compared
Based on the Presidency‚Äôs proposal , the CAP would have cost EUR 305 billion for the whole of the period in question
The public research policies of the Member States and of the European Union , if the national policies had remained at today‚Äôs levels , would have represented EUR 524
5 billion for the period 2007‚Äì2013 , far more than the common agricultural policy
reformulation of the Lisbon strategy , they would have increased the public share of research budgets from 1
9% to 3% of GDP
National and EU research policies should have reached a total of EUR 785 billion by 2013
share of research budgets ‚Äì compared to EUR 305 billion for the CAP
So let us hear no more nonsense talked about this affair
Spending on the common agricultural policy would have been adjusted downwards and , on a comparison with something genuinely comparable , would be well below half the figure for research spending
So , let us stop comparing things which are not comparable
That , Mr President , is a brief summary of the facts
Today we have a disagreement
We shall have to find an agreement enabling us to introduce the new policies on good terms in the new Member States from 2007 onwards
dignity
common policies , and without damaging the cohesion policies
This is essential ‚Äì absolutely imperative
issues , is ready to contribute wholeheartedly to a search for that solution , without bitterness or a spirit of revenge
Mr President , the last item on the agenda of the European Council was the process of ratifying the Constitution
I shall deal with this aspect more succinctly because , here , the decisions of the European Council have been reported more objectively by the participants and observers
It is a fact that ten countries have ratified the Constitutional Treaty , while two others , France and the Netherlands , have rejected it
the response to many of the problems of Europe‚Äôs citizens with the European Union
Consequently , we opted to persevere with the ratification process
in a referendum , decided , in the wake of that decision , to defer their scheduled referenda or parliamentary ratification
In those countries , the debate will take place
Constitutional Treaty
It is vital that the European debate , enriched and nourished by the ideas of everyone involved , should take place in all Member States of the European Union
national parliaments all to join in that vast debate
I also want the Commission to take its rightful place in the debate ‚Äì a discussion which will be both 27-times national and European
very centre of the discussions
can be guided by wisdom and ambition
do it , it is urgent
forces , a market unable to produce solidarity , and another based , not rather more but completely , on a more highly-developed political integration
The free trade area on one side and political union on the other
This is the debate we are about to have , and we are already seeing Europe divided into two opposing camps
There are those who believe that Europe as it stands has already gone too far , and those , like me , who think it has still not gone far enough
even to engage in dialogue
We , the European institutions , must build a bridge between these two camps of our public opinion
Europe , were making a big mistake
That no one really wanted Europe to become a free trade area; that reassured me considerably
As you know , free trade areas cannot be established overnight
trade area
of the free trade area would view it as a backward step ‚Äì to political union
There are those who say they have no intention of leading Europe towards a free trade area , an excessively simplistic concept for an ultra-complicated continent
It is quite simple: those who thought they were highlighting the dangers of a free trade area were wrong
Those who say they were wrong will use the next few months and years to show that they , too , want nothing but political union as described in the Constitution
It is as simple as that , a matter of saying yes or no to the question I have just asked
institutional rules , to respect what is often referred to as the institutional triangle , which I still consider to offer a number of benefits
We have done so systematically during this Presidency
Between the Presidency of the European Union and the Commission there has been an exchange of views , an ongoing and virtuous debate
Nothing done by the Presidency has been done without the Commission's prior knowledge
No initiative has been taken by the Commission without the Presidency being notified in advance
The Presidency consulted the Commission on the initiatives it was taking , and vice versa
amount of good advice it gave to the Luxembourg Presidency
Thank you Mr Barroso
As regards Parliament , we worked together like twins
obtain your agreement , an agreement which , however , was spontaneously forthcoming whenever the Presidency referred its initiatives to you prior to submitting them to the other Member States
Today , the European Parliament has reached maturity
I have heard since 1982
It is a great Parliament , which has no reason to keep a low profile , which has its legitimacy and which carries the hopes of the people of Europe
Very often in its plenary sessions not enough Members are present ‚Äì not the case today , I am very pleased to say
Perhaps this is an area where more work is needed
I talk to Parliament and , when I leave Parliament , I talk to groups of visitors
Those coming to Parliament do not come just to look at the debating Chamber; they want to see it full
So , there is room for improvement here
Apart from that , we know why it is that Members cannot always be present in the Chamber
I must say that it is a great pleasure to work with Parliament , both in public sessions and , above all , in committees
What depth of knowledge , what commitment to the European cause is displayed in meetings of the parliamentary groups and parliamentary committees , and in the numerous discussions with individual Members
this Chamber and elsewhere
Mr President , early on 18 June on the morning after the European Council , I bitterly regretted having failed to avoid Europe plunging , not irrevocably but undeniably , into a crisis
I regretted it and it showed
I have read that I was not very diplomatic , but I have no desire to be diplomatic when Europe is in crisis , none whatsoever
Nor did I want to be an actor , merely playing a role
I am not an actor , I want to work for the interests of Europe and its citizens
I have no time for acting
understand , people believe we are machines
We are not machines; we are human beings experiencing disappointment and despondency
I was disappointed because I had believed that Europe could be considered to have come of age , to have matured
I had to admit that it is still in its adolescence
Having believed it to be adult , I now see that we are still in the last stages of a long period of adolescence
That is why I am disappointed
However , I also had reasons to be pleased
an agreement on the financial perspectives
20 out of 25 countries is no mean achievement
Council meeting
What a disgrace for those who were not able to do as much
I felt my convictions being shaken in the early hours of 18 June , and did not have the strength , or the greatness , to launch another appeal on the same day
Not everyone can be De Gaulle
I am surprised at my own modesty
encouragement from the Commission , Parliament and many observers who are also protagonists , I now feel , now that the first disappointment has passed , more determined than ever
Our generation does not have the right to undo the achievements of prior generations
We do not have the right to demolish the work of our predecessors , because future generations will need a political Europe
If it is not political , it will lose its way
They need and want a Europe of solidarity , a social Europe , a competitive Europe , a Europe which is strong at home and strong in the world
So , members of old Europe , committed Europeans , back to work
With enthusiasm
my life , I would either be right or pleasantly surprised
in pessimism
I think I can say that , now more than ever , we need to show our determination
It is true that there are problems in Europe , and it is true that they are serious problems , but we must confront them and be able to find a solution
During the Luxembourg Presidency , we have witnessed the implementation of grand initiatives and innovations which will guide the activities of the European Union over the years to come
my friend Mr Juncker
First of all , we succeeded in adopting our strategic objectives for the EU over the coming five years
It was the first time that they were approved jointly with the Council and Parliament
Today , those same broad guiding principles in terms of prosperity , solidarity and security provide us with a framework , a framework shared by all the institutions of the European Union
We therefore have the opportunity for our actions to be much more effective and focused , and to be able to translate our actions into a true partnership for renewal
It is also thanks to the Luxembourg Presidency that we have negotiated an agreement on how to base the Stability and Growth Pact on a more realistic and practical foundation
This reform has neither weakened nor relaxed the pact
It has even given governments greater flexibility , via the financial instruments , to optimise growth over the economic cycle
Council
This was a step forward , not only for the institutions and governments , but also for all European citizens
not discuss the possible configurations of the blocking minority in the system of qualified majority voting
What actually concerns our fellow citizens is the slowdown in the economy
Above all , they are anxious about their jobs or the difficulty of finding work
That is why we have relaunched the Lisbon Strategy: growth and employment
That is why we think that we must , all of us , the European institutions , increase our efforts in areas that directly affect the lives of our citizens
That is the route to take to reforge the links between Europe and its citizens and to respond to the concerns of Europeans
That said , there have been other successes during the Luxembourg Presidency , particularly in our external relations
other side of the Atlantic , all of that can be credited to the Luxembourg Presidency
with regard to the financial perspectives
First of all , the debate on the future of Europe
The European Council‚Äôs decision seems to me to be a wise one
The European leaders decided to have a period of reflection and have opened the door to debate , dialogue and democracy
important , but also to the parliaments , the social partners and young people in these countries
each Member State , but that must also be held at European level
We are going to do that , and we hope that , at the end of this exercise , we will be able to present to all Europeans our strategic vision for Europe
What will Europe be like in the coming years , in the six or fifteen years to come
We must launch this debate without being afraid of any of the subjects , even those that are more difficult and more complex for the institutions
We must discuss not only expenditure but also our aims
We must talk about the European social model
How can we work on it in the 21st century
How can we modernise this European social model
How can we reach an equilibrium with regard to Community legislation
How can we avoid bureaucracy at European level
How can we deal with further enlargement , such that Europeans can support it and understand the importance of having a united Europe
you because we think it is necessary to build a new consensus in Europe
I shall now turn to the other main subject of last week‚Äôs summit
It was very disappointing that we were unable to reach a conclusion on the financial perspective
The presidency worked tirelessly for a breakthrough and I have to say that we were near an agreement
Unfortunately , discussions on the budget have seldom brought out the best in the Member States and , sadly , last week it was no different
There are some fundamentally different views and some clear national interests , but this in itself is not so unusual
What makes the situation especially delicate is that this ‚Äòno solution‚Äô for the financial perspective comes after two ‚Äònoes‚Äô in two national referenda
I regret that , during the European Council , no leaders were able to show a true spirit of compromise and solidarity on that very important occasion
But it would be wrong to give the impression that we have gone nowhere as a result of last week
The committed work of the Luxembourg presidency over the last six months has brought us a long way
This is important because there is a real urgency to get an agreement
particularly the new Member States
I want to underline the very constructive approach taken by the new Member States
Sometimes people ask me whether it is not more difficult to be in the Commission now with 25 ‚Äì and very soon to be 27 ‚Äì Member States
Is it not a much more complex and difficult European Union
I say it is , but let us be frank
in Europe today
When we consider the work of the Luxembourg presidency we have to say that we cannot go backwards
We must build on the outgoing presidency‚Äôs achievements in order to get an agreement as soon as possible
The incoming presidency has made it clear that it also intends to take these dossiers forward and we now wait with interest for the UK presidency to relaunch the process
The Commission is ready to work with this presidency and all the Member States
More work is needed
I made it clear last week that I have real problems with the downgrading of some of the policies that the Commission and Parliament have emphasised
This is particularly true of those policies aimed at renewed economic dynamism
Genuine reform comes at a price
Reducing the Commission‚Äôs proposed spending in areas such as research , innovation , education or transport and energy networks will have a real policy cost
Our citizens are unlikely to be forgiving if we fail to deliver on our promise regarding growth and jobs
But let us be frank
the areas that were particularly sacrificed were precisely those of competitiveness , growth , education , innovation and research
Cohesion was more or less kept
and research
This shows the price of that famous letter from six of the Member States asking for one per cent
It is a pity that the Member States that agreed on one per cent expenditure ‚Äì the ones agreeing on that ‚Äì cannot now agree in the European Council
In fact , they were divided on the issue
It shows what happens all too often today in Europe
‚Äòyes‚Äô and not more coalitions for ‚Äòno‚Äô
These important coalitions are needed for the project for Europe to go forward
The Commission will go on with its work and will pursue the goal of reaching a balanced agreement with the Member States
This must involve Parliament
all parties: Parliament , the Commission and the Council
The negotiations will only be over at that moment
I count on Parliament‚Äôs support in this respect
I do not want to underestimate the degree of difficulty nor the disagreements on priorities , but this necessary debate should not delay an agreement
This is why , even before the European Council , the Commission proposed a review clause
I was very happy to work with President-in-Office Juncker and , as he said earlier , we were discussing a review clause with the Member States
perspective
the international environment
This is wisdom itself
What we cannot use now is an overall debate on priorities as a reason or pretext for not reaching an agreement on the financial perspective
However , at the same time , it is true that we should engage in a serious debate about the reform of the Community budget
We must look forward
It is also true that we should have a meeting at a later stage in order to address all those important questions
This is why we should keep to the deadline for the next phase of the negotiations
Union
We must avoid that risk
Even during this very difficult situation , we are continuing to take decisions
As President-in-Office Juncker said , after the European Council we were taking decisions with our partners in the United States and Canada
Yesterday I was in Italy for the inauguration of the European Food Safety Authority
Today the Commission took important decisions on a Green Paper on energy efficiency and a new regime for the sugar markets
We are continuing to make decisions
I promise you that the Commission does not feel any kind of inhibitions about taking the decisions or initiatives that Europe deserves
However , it is important now to engage the Council , all partners and all institutions and to move in the same direction
I ask you not to overlook the other achievements of the European Council
We have seen the endorsement of the new integrated guidelines for growth and employment and an action plan to implement The Hague Programme for freedom , security and justice
These two results address our key objectives of prosperity and security and the mainstream concerns of our citizens
The European Council also approved guiding principles for sustainable development
This should ensure continuing improvements to the quality of life , not only for current generations but also for future ones
Commission proposal about our commitment to overseeing development aid and our commitment to Africa
This was a very important step taken by the European Council
What follows now
Is the glass half empty or half full
As I said before , the problem is serious but we can turn it into an opportunity
Sooner or later this clarification had to come and , let us face it , we now have that opportunity
We are closer to agreement on the financial perspective than many people realise
We should also remember that never in the history of the European Union have financial packages been approved during the first round of negotiations
Therefore , I call on all the parties concerned to reflect on the consequences of deadlock and to show some flexibility
I call on all the parties to show less nationalistic rhetoric and to engage in a truly European solution
The fact remains that both the Luxembourg presidency in general and the European Council in particular have achieved much of which we can be proud
It is true that there is still much to do
business as usual
We will then be able to prove that the pessimists and the cynics are not always right and that there are reasons to have confidence in the future
I would like to finish with a few words for my friend Mr Juncker
and for the experts
I have been really moved to see the conviction , the determination and the enthusiasm of everybody in this extraordinary team
On behalf of the European Commission , I would like to thank you , Jean-Claude , and all your colleagues , for what you have done for Europe
I sincerely hope that I will be able to say the same thing to the next President of the European Council
I will say the same thing if I think it , but I will not say it if I do not think it
Presidencies come and go , but the Commission remains
its full sincere support to the various Presidencies
For its part , the Commission expects the various Presidencies to have the same vocation , the same determination and the same enthusiasm for our European Union

has led us , in the European Union , through these months
For this dedication , for this passion , for this conviction , Mr Juncker , you have the warm thanks of the PPE-DE Group
On Saturday morning , the President-in-Office of the European Council‚Äôs disappointment was plain for us all to see , and this disappointment we shared with him
We hope the day will come when we will again be able to join together in rejoicing over successes , and that is now a task for all of us
‚Äì is itself a sign of hope
Who , 20 years ago , would have thought that there would be Members in this House hailing from Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania
It is because that is such a tremendous thing that we must , even now , believe in our continent‚Äôs future
with you‚Äô
determination and deliberation
future
as regards many people‚Äôs confidence in the European Union‚Äôs policymakers
Many people feel that a lot of things are going too fast , and we must regard the regaining of their trust as a common endeavour
What is our goal
have a fight on their hands
Our Group wants no part of any such thing; we want a strong , effective and democratic European Union , one that enables us to defend our interests in the world
while others are dreaming of a change of government ushering in an axis between the United Kingdom and Germany
whole , and it is on this basis of goodwill that we , in the European Union , must then function as a community
It is worth my adding that the Treaty of Nice makes provision for enhanced cooperation
If some countries want to go further , we can do just that in many areas ‚Äì foreign and security policy among them
Where the Constitutional Treaty is concerned , we must be self-critical
The referendum in Luxembourg is now , no doubt , going to go ahead on 10 July , and I wish the President-in-Office every success in it
We now have a pause for thought , and we must use it in order to think
over , Parts 1 and 2 of the Constitutional Treaty can become legal and political realities
it as their guide and to seek to make the reforms that are needed
This House has already given its answer
May 2004 , and that must be able to rely on our common solidarity in planning how they are to develop their weakest regions
incoming British presidency
We in the PPE-DE Group will play our part in making this possible , and we will do so in a spirit of solidarity

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , totting up the debits and credits of the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council has been an emotional business
We have heard a speech that was extraordinary not only by reason of the character of the man delivering it , but also by reason of its extraordinary frankness
I have been a Member of this House for 11 years
In all that time , I have never come across such frankness in a presentation on a European Council by its Presidency
For this frankness I am grateful , for it gives this House greater knowledge and hence affords it the opportunity to better analyse what transpired last weekend
A lot happened , and let me repeat at the very outset what you , Mr President-in-Office , said: it was a defeat for Europe
You were right there
You went on to say that it also represented a defeat for the Presidency , but that is where you are wrong
Anyone who saw you over the weekend ‚Äì and we all did ‚Äì saw something that was not a defeat for the Council Presidency
It may well , today , be too early to judge , but I am quite certain that those who come after us will rank Jean-Claude Juncker among the truly great Europeans
For that we are grateful to you
speech , for it is a fact that what emerges from this summit is that the time really has come for the European Union to spell out the facts
Europe is indeed in a crisis situation , but then so are its Heads of State or Government
‚Äì have invariably taken the same approach
Victory was theirs; it was the Brussels bureaucrats who lost
Government who believe that the interests of all are served when each thinks only of himself
told
Today , Mr Juncker , I want to give you every credit for telling it like it is and for calling things by their proper names
Commission produced its proposal for the Financial Perspective , and Parliament decided on its position , while the Council has shown itself incapable of coming to an agreement on it
Let me point out that two of the institutions that participate in the trialogue have done what they had to do
The Council has not , and we will wait
It is not acceptable that everyone sitting around the table should be saying ‚ÄòI‚Äôm right‚Äô
Then the next person to be called upon to speak says , ‚ÄòI‚Äôm right , too‚Äô
The third person to speak also says , ‚ÄòThat may well be so , but I‚Äôm right‚Äô
How such people can reach a result that is of any use to Europe escapes me
help to wreck the instruments that are needed in order to achieve those goals
I simply do not get it , and I do not see this as something that this House can take lying down
What is the Financial Perspective about
It is about everyone making a move
process
We also know , of course , that we need money in order to do these things , and that it follows that money has to be reassigned
Yet , if everyone knows that , why do we not get the right results
not the deciding factor
Things were of course said about Europe‚Äôs future , but most of the speeches made there were devoted to internal policy
We all know that there is a great island state in this Union , where internal party constraints limit room for manoeuvre
We all know too that there is a great continental state in this Union in which the results of elections hang upon agriculture
House , unite in saying that we are no longer prepared to do so , for this is proving to be Europe‚Äôs ruin
The President deserves praise for having , today , delivered himself of a fine affirmation of his role in Europe
You , Mr Barroso , are indeed the guardian of the European Treaties
of integration far too far for that to be possible , and if you want to defend the deepening of Europe , this House will always be right alongside you
been built up over decades
Directive and the Services Directive adopted as social ‚Äì rather than as anti-social ‚Äì legislation
That will give you a chance to show where the Commission stands
We have heard a great speech from a great President
Mr Juncker , I thank you , as well as Mr Schmit and all those who have worked together with us this past six months
Working with the Luxembourg Presidency was ‚Äì I believe , for all of us ‚Äì an extraordinarily pleasant business
Differences of opinion are not always so pleasant in this political life
Thank you for your speech , and I believe I speak for many of my colleagues when I say that I look forward to tomorrow with eager anticipation
Thank you , Mr President
President-in-Office , if the Luxembourg presidency has failed your expectations , I hope you will not blame yourself
President-in-Office , Liberals and Democrats in this House applaud your attempts to keep the EU show on the road
You tried hard to strike the deals Europe needs
Your lack of success was not for lack of effort
Your final summit was doomed from the moment France voted to reject the Constitution
The triumphalism of the ‚Äòno‚Äô voters , however , will be short lived
In Greek tragedy , actors often deepen their own plight while believing that their actions will help them to escape it
So is the case with the French and the Socialists who were their cheerleaders
Their votes will bring to bear the very changes they most fear
At least in Greek tragedy the audience is permitted to understand what is happening
That luxury is available to many of us only with hindsight some time after the referenda
presidency of the week of 29 May 2005
Had you done so you might have looked upon that week as a defining moment in the history of a European Union that will never be the same again
Hence your final summit was characterised not by the pockets of resistance of which you spoke optimistically , but by a fight between two ailing dinosaurs , Britain and France
Unable to admit that national sovereignty is a luxury of the past , they persist in trying to impose their order on others
Britain seeks a British Europe rather than a European Britain
France is just as insular without the excuse of being an island
Both harbour a dangerous illusion , for there can be only one Europe , truly European
That Europe must have the necessary funding to function
The insistence by some Member States on one per cent of GNI would deprive us of the Lisbon investment , as indeed your final proposal might have done
It is perhaps better to have no agreement and to re-think both how we raise money and how we spend it , than to reach agreement at any cost
geographical line of demarcation between Europe and non-Europe
There is another way of setting limits: that which distinguishes those who have the European spirit and those who have not
‚Äô
President-in-Office , the Franco-German motor of European integration on which your presidency relied is kaput
We need another motor to replace it
It must be neither British nor French
wait for Europe
So do not allow this pause for reflection to be a period of paralysis
Go home and make sure you win your referendum
Then mobilise the other smaller states to prevent the prehistoric predators from destroying what has been built
driving licence; and , with luck , even the elusive Members‚Äô Statute to demonstrate the maturity of this House
All of these mark good progress for the Union , and you may well conclude that you are left with more than just an overflowing ashtray
As Aristotle taught us , we may not always achieve our goals , but it is our pursuit of them that changes the course of history

with a firm belief in Europe and a certain charisma and credibility , we would be home and dry
and you might have been able to play a more direct part in a European debate that we , in fact , believe is very important
revive the European economic machine , or to put positive initiatives in the pipeline , of the sort that people dream about
of a Europe of uncertain and frightened peoples
an unsustainable reduction of the Union‚Äôs budget
I greatly respect your pragmatism , your realism and understanding of the difficulty and the complicated calculations that you have outlined to us here
Lisbon policy ‚Äì that are not acceptable for today‚Äôs Europe
you in your referendum
Today , it seems that those who only want Europe to be a large supermarket have a definite advantage compared with those who want a political Europe
Tony Blair will come to us , spruce and smiling , explaining how to make Europe even more intergovernmental and weak
The only plan in sight for now is clearly the Blair plan
time to reflect on the Constitution , without , however , putting an end to the ratification process for those who wish for it to continue
I can already tell you today , Mr President , that a great many members of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will support you for the referendum in Luxembourg
closed need to be reopened
It is on those two issues that the conflict between the ‚Äòsupermarketeers‚Äô and the unionists will burn itself out
20 ministers together
budget , then we need to act immediately and unambiguously
Forget about agreeing on the details
priorities , and not the other way round , and reopen the debate on everything: the CAP , Life-Nature and the Structural Funds
your Commission
climate change , the tangible redefinition of social Europe , the working time directive , serious attention paid to the Millennium Round commitments
All of this is perfectly feasible and will help us to revive the Constitution
the European Parliament has to take some of the responsibility for that
action to place it at the centre of a European-initiative debate
Thank you very much , Mrs Frassoni; addressing the President of Parliament does not excuse you from having to respect speaking time
the European Parliament by giving us such a sincere , transparent and enlightening report on the European Council
In my 26 years of parliamentary experience , this is a first for me
Juncker: the ratification of the draft Constitutional Treaty
with regard to the demands expressed by these votes and with regard to their scope , which goes far beyond the two countries directly concerned
at the heart of the ‚Äúno‚Äù vote‚Äô
Among the main reasons cited for voting ‚Äòno‚Äô are that , and I quote: ‚Äòeconomically speaking the draft is seen as too liberal‚Äô and ‚Äòthe lack of social Europe‚Äô
The commentary adds , and again I quote , that ‚Äòthe rejection of Turkey‚Äôs membership of the EU was mentioned spontaneously by only 6% of people who voted ‚Äúno‚Äù‚Äô
The electorate‚Äôs choice was , as the Eurobarometer document notes , made after careful consideration
We should also add that just 4% of the people surveyed declared themselves to be against Europe
The message is therefore clear: ‚Äòyes‚Äô to Europe , including an enlarged Europe , but ‚Äòno‚Äô to the liberal direction it is taking
This sentiment is shared by many other peoples , which doubtless explains the domino effect of the first two ‚Äòno‚Äô votes
European citizens
This is the context in which we need to assess the last European Council
Let us summarise
to democracy
It has agreed , and again I quote , ‚Äòto reflect together‚Äô , to gain some time , as a high-up European official was kind enough to specify
rejected: we could not have done better in turning our backs on the expectations of Europeans
In this regard , Mr Juncker , having worked so hard to avoid such a deplorable outcome , found the right words to denounce the main culprit for this fiasco
in my view , incarnates a narrow concept of Europe , with no relation to our declared ambitions
the House
Mr Schulz appears to be responding positively to this idea , but in a very institutional context
this time
ability to listen to their message and our determination to take it fully into account
However , we will discuss that tomorrow in the presence of our next Presidency , which will clearly be different from the outgoing one
The great debate on the future of Europe is getting off to a good start
I have often praised the Luxembourg Presidency
rejected by the French in a binding referendum
What an insult to your French neighbours and Dutch friends from the Benelux countries
What contempt for the law
it will not ratify the Constitution
What a retreat from reality , too
All reflective people know that that document would never survive a referendum in , for example , Great Britain
The Constitution is dead
One should bury the dead , and doing so cannot be deferred or postponed
basis of population figures and with no proper exercise of democracy , would shift power from the electorate to officials
You are wasting time
Let us , rather , start afresh
Let us bring the same number of proponents and opponents of the Constitution together and prepare a joint consultation document for new ground rules
We shall be able to discuss this and elect a new Convention able to represent the electorate‚Äôs attitude to Europe‚Äôs future
EU countries
If we devise an agreement that is better than the Treaty of Nice , most Europeans will naturally vote in favour of it
If the watchwords are transparency , democracy and proximity to the people , we shall also be happy to do so
be able to elect its own Commissioner
There are only , respectively , 11% and 12% of Danes who are opposed to these proposals
That is the type of support we should be seeking by means of a new treaty
We should not be seeking a Constitution to take precedence over Luxembourg‚Äôs and other countries‚Äô constitutions
could not have expected that everything would turn out as the Presidency had envisaged
have demanded it , played a significant part in forming a negative attitude
That is how the citizens of the European Union perceived it
the politicians of the Member States
success
domestic political failures
Too often , when taking difficult domestic political decisions , politicians from the Member States do not forget to justify them by reference to European Union requirements
It seems that we have overspent our credit
There exist two visions of the European Union‚Äôs future ‚Äì one of a political European Union and one of a European Union of high-level economic cooperation
of political integration
That , to my mind , is the clearest lesson of the last two referenda
example , wish to call the European Treaty a Constitution
Can we really consider the Council meeting to be a long-term failure
It approved the Lisbon Strategy , a strategy that means a lot more than integration of the internal market
of our economic and social policy , a direction for Europe to grow as united and competitive , and in the medium term to regain the confidence of society
future
That , however , can only be implemented if we can overcome the attitude towards cooperation in the European Union that we have exhibited until now
It is enough to recall the current unproductive debates on the Services Directive , which is a cornerstone of the Lisbon Strategy
will be able to find a basis for important tasks ‚Äì security and cooperation , the enlargement of the European Union and cohesion policy
Madam President , it was Bertolt Brecht who quipped that political leaders should simply choose a different people when the people vote incorrectly
in Brussels ‚Äì to ignore the vote of the Dutch and the French people
Allow me to quote a small example from my own country to illustrate my point
take part in the radio and television debates that were organised on the subject
than others
while , by way of comparison , the annual budget of the US alone amounts to USD 2 500 billion
What matters is not so much whether Europe spends enough money in order to meet tomorrow‚Äôs challenges , but that it should do so by using its funds differently
Europe should not get involved in matters that would , in the final analysis , be regulated more effectively at national level
Europe should really start observing the principle of subsidiarity if it wants to count on the public‚Äôs understanding
Dutch Prime Minister , who was treated with such contempt by our own Foreign Affairs Minister on account of his consistent stance
At the risk of shocking some of you , it follows that I cannot get too excited about the failure of last week‚Äôs summit
Contrary to what some are trying to make out , neither the world , nor Europe , will collapse as a result of it
is called for before we hurtle down the path we have chosen
consideration
this House had hoped
We all know what was decided in Brussels and , moreover , what was not
I now want to convey two messages on behalf of Luxembourg‚Äôs Members of the Group of the European People‚Äôs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats
The first is a message of appreciation for the outstanding achievements of the Luxembourg Presidency in general and of the President , Mr Jean-Claude Juncker , in particular
the success of enlargement , then we cannot expect what comes out of the summit to move Europe any further forward
in France and the Netherlands , voted against the European Constitution
makes me feel ashamed
about , nor of the European Union being anything other than a continental bargain-basement
endurance over the last 15 years were anything other than futile
We should all be ashamed of the way in which certain participants in the summit behaved
If the founding fathers had behaved as they did , there would have been no united Europe , and half a billion Europeans would never have known peace , freedom and prosperity
Europe will change and continue to develop , just as it did after the French National Assembly rejected the European Defence Community
of the pettiness and egoism that caused the last European Council to fail
Madam President , Mr Barroso , Mr Juncker , ladies and gentlemen , all Presidencies preside , but do not decide
The Luxembourg Presidency has indeed presided
It has drafted many constructive proposals , and it has managed to produce honourable compromises on a number of topics
The Lisbon Strategy has been relaunched and the national parliaments have finally become more sensitive to this grand European objective
The Stability and Growth Pact will be more intelligent , as it is adapted to economic cycles
The broad economic policy and employment guidelines have been agreed for three years
notable advances with regard to police cooperation and to security at external borders , etc
Heads of Government
I have had the opportunity to say in this forum that the EU is currently sadly lacking in statesmen
It is governed by political gnomes busy jealously guarding their small treasure
Very few leaders have a true political vision of the future of Europe
Mr Juncker is not one of them
He is both an architect and a plumber
counterparts in the rich countries
Yes , Europe suffers from internal contradictions
There are those who push for greater political integration and those who simply want one huge market
Europe is in crisis
Etymologically , the Greek word means ‚Äòdecision‚Äô
The time for a decision has come; we have to choose: more Europe , or the opt-out
The Luxembourg Presidency has done its best to move Europe forward , and it deserves well of Europe
reform
Yes , the world is changing
Europe has to adapt
Any community that does not have close links to employment , salaries and productivity becomes unfair , however , and , at the end of the day , becomes poorer
I have just quoted Carlos Fuentes
The economy must continue to serve social well-being , and solidarity must be the keyword of European politics
Europe will either be social or will not be at all , Madam President
founding real agreement on hopes , and not on fears , and in making it understood that new global concerns can only be addressed at European level
I should like to thank Mr Juncker for his sincere efforts and the European passion that he has demonstrated
the vision of the greatest pro-Europeans
We would also like it if the other leaders of the Community institutions demonstrated the same courage and leadership in future
Let us remember , however , that a defeat is only a defeat when we accept it , and we must not accept it
We are faced with a difficult crisis , the most difficult for many years: first of all the referendum , and today the failed agreement
A Pandora‚Äôs box has been opened , exposing different visions of Europe
20 years ago , we will be talking about the costs of non-Europe , and the costs of non-Europe are higher than the costs of Europe
that Mr Juncker has outlined to us is therefore unsustainable
There will no longer be development or a social model if the Euro group does not address the issue of common economic policy alongside that of monetary policy
on foreign policy and common security
This crisis will not be short-lived
The electoral calendar in Germany , in France and also in Italy , without mentioning others , does not help us
Time for reflection , however , ladies and gentlemen , cannot , and must not , become a Mexican siesta
out by this Parliament in the constitutional triangle
In difficult times , our Parliament has been able to launch ideas and summon the European spirit
After years in which discussion has taken place on Europe for the people , it has to be us who must learn to communicate with the people
with business as usual , and that we have understood both the unease of the people and the unsatisfactory responses of many governments
We will try to remember that the Commission will certainly be the custodian of the treaties , but that we are the representatives of the European people
Madam President , I would like to start by thanking the Luxembourg presidency for the good and pragmatic work it has done
would do us all a lot of good
In the aftermath of the summit , Europe is the subject of much negative language and sentiment
attitude to this Europe of ours
that they want: they want more input into debates , and they want Europe‚Äôs actual policies to go in a different direction
against the Constitution
My final point is that , in Luxembourg , on 10 July , we will be campaigning for the Constitution
not the problem , but rather the solution to our problem
Madam President , no is no
The Dutch ‚Äòno‚Äô is final
Those are not my words but of Mr Balkenende , the Dutch Prime Minister , in today‚Äôs
Following the Dutch and French voters‚Äô rejection of the proposed text of the Constitution , most national governments are now opting for a time of reflection
a broad social discussion involving the general public and social organisations
be one across Europe
particularly Turkey , and against financial solidarity with the poorest regions
uncertain future
They fear that Europe will increasingly resemble the USA
They are also indignant about projects that are vulnerable to fraud and about subsidies being poured into large agricultural companies
The unnecessary pumping of structural fund monies among the richest Member States is another cause of irritation
Does Mr Juncker agree with me that the neoliberal policy of emphasis on the market has helped foster opposition to this Constitution among the voters
It is a good thing that last week , the Council did not make any hasty decisions about random cutbacks or the exclusion of new Member States
First of all , we must discuss what we want , about what Europe does and does not do
in national , regional and local democracy
Is the Council prepared to start such a study
I would like a response to that
this Europe , the Europe of bankers , which is so far removed from the dream of the patriots , the visionaries , the founding fathers of the European idea
the ‚ÄòYoung Europe‚Äô movementWhat is emerging from the discussions of the European Council is more reminiscent of the Congress of Vienna than of that great patriot‚Äôs vision of solidarity
The voice of the peoples must be heard , not the interests of high finance
It is the peoples that suffer , together with the real economy , as a result of the havoc and failures of the euro
So why not hold a referendum on the euro
Instead , after having heard the results of the referenda , you write in your conclusions that the recent developments do not challenge the legitimacy of continuing the ratification process
Nothing changes
taken into account
Fortunately , they have not disappeared: there is still a vestige of national sovereignty left
people , because the people very often say: enough of the euro
It is the Member States , the nations , that are the repositories of the democratic will of the citizens , not your technobureaucracy that is accountable to no one
Those discussions , that end of Europe is the result of your method of enlargement
Even Mr Prodi is now distancing himself from enlargement and from the decision on Turkey
It is a little too late , however
Madam President , the fiasco of the recent EU summit has left the European Union at a crossroads
No one should rejoice at this crisis , however , regardless of the reasons behind it
to the European Union itself
The latter is something we should all value
No one should make rash judgments either
or to regulations that enhance social solidarity , the EU now appears to be saying that it has no interest in either efficiency or solidarity
Yet no one can claim that the recent EU enlargement is the cause of the crisis
current demand for plumbing services in that country
The problems we are experiencing with regard to the new Financial Perspective do not boil down to a simple dispute over money
be created without growth
On the whole , the EU‚Äôs economies are over-regulated , and in addition , unemployment is not falling
Unless we want to escalate the crisis further , we must develop a job-creation strategy based on more effective action , enhanced competitiveness and higher incomes
There is another dimension to this crisis , namely the failure of the Constitutional Treaty
If its architects were keen to hear what the EU‚Äôs citizens had to say , then they have achieved their goal
The only problem is that the EU‚Äôs citizens have voiced their national opposition to a federal EU
The European project therefore needs to be thoroughly reconsidered , and the reforms must start from grass-roots level
Attempts by an all-seeing elite to bestow happiness on people by force always prove counter-productive
My final point relates to the common foreign policy , with regard to which people quite obviously have varying and divergent priorities
I say this in view of Mr Juncker‚Äôs comments on improvements in the EU‚Äôs relations with Russia
other new Member States
to promote the interests of individual countries
I would have liked to have started by thanking Mr Juncker , but he is probably not interested in our opinions
Nevertheless , I would still like to say that I appreciate his stance in really trying to integrate the new Member States into the functioning of the European Union
I am sorry that the Luxembourg presidency will be connected with the failure of the Constitutional Treaty
I must say , however , that it is precisely the inability of the Council to deal with the current situation that demonstrates the necessity of the Constitutional Treaty
The Constitutional Treaty is not dead: it is , alas , the Council itself , unable to resolve this deadlock , that is dead and ineffective
Council members cannot agree , as they struggle to protect their political hides in the domestic arena
Today it is the European Parliament and the European Commission that know how to agree and adopt majority decisions
Both these institutions work and take decisions that directly affect the lives of the people of the European Union
It was stated during your presidency that the targets set by the Lisbon strategy are unrealistic
But the reality , that is , a proposed solution , was not offered to us , and remains a hot potato for the next presidency
And unfortunately not even the next presidency is a guarantee that the Lisbon strategy will be resolved rather than merely criticised
If Kissinger were to ask for Europe‚Äôs telephone number today , he would be given 25 numbers to choose from
Who to choose
Big
Rich
Active
It is exactly those who have now turned their backs on solidarity and on us all
Madam President , I in my turn would like to pay every homage to the Luxembourg Presidency
Listening to Mr Juncker , I was proud to belong to a Europe presided over by a man of such quality
this criterion that , from tomorrow , we will judge your successor
I would like to add three comments on the financial perspectives
the nine months of work by its temporary committee
Our Parliament has succeeded in making difficult choices between old policies and new ones
The Council could benefit from taking inspiration from this example
I am sure that the future Presidency will find food for thought in it
on Research
We propose to pursue legislation relating to the legal bases for the multi-annual policies so that those policies can enter into force on 1 January 2007
has remained stable with respect to EU revenue
This confirms the analysis that we have made here right from the start
the Ministers for Finance
Our Committee on Budgets invited the committees of the national parliaments to an initial exchange of views on this subject last week
aid the governments in their search for the necessary compromise
some difficult compromises
Nevertheless , this period has also been rich in disappointments
We , too , have faith in the Lisbon Strategy , the key principle of which , solidarity , is one of the fundamental values for the European left
It is very important , even though we know that these last few days have not really been characterised by that solidarity
This period has also been an experience with regard to the functioning of relations between the European institutions
Despite the improvements , we are not completely satisfied with the role that Parliament has been able to obtain in this legally complicated and uncertain situation
European Parliament: the progress of the Constitution in that regard has been replaced by a permanent and complicated necessity for political compromises
However , the Luxembourg Presidency‚Äôs message was clear: no to a two-speed Europe , yes to a social Europe
Of the main starting objectives , the financial perspectives were not adopted
Despite the efforts of the new Member States , which were prepared to make many concessions during the Summit , the budgetary debate did not result in unqualified success
The President , though , has nothing to be ashamed of
Drawing conclusions from the last six months , I am convinced that we will continue to travel together down the European road
I would like to think that , in deciding the itinerary , the small countries will also have a contribution to make
Madam President , the EU is undoubtedly in crisis
The clear ‚Äòno‚Äô votes in the two referenda have plunged the whole of the EU into a kind of vacuum , with great uncertainty about the future
I am naturally sorry that the French and the Dutch rejected the Constitutional Treaty , but ‚Äòno‚Äô votes as clear as that must be respected
as to implement the reforms so badly needed by the EU
The crisis was of course exacerbated by the ‚Äòbudget fiasco‚Äô but , in many ways , it is better to have no budget at all than a bad one
I do not think that this budget was especially modern
We cannot , however , put the whole of the EU in the deep-freeze and wait for the distrust felt by many towards the EU suddenly to disappear
taken in Brussels
odds with each other
We cannot allow the muggy haze that has descended over the whole of Europe to put a stop to cooperation
We have an enormous amount to do
We have the Lisbon process and the myth-enshrouded Services Directive , which are genuinely needed
We must combat cross-border crime
We have the ambitious environmental work involving REACH , and there is an enormous amount to do within the foreign policy field
high ambition and a large degree of unity , something that is extremely commendable
The EU has , and must continue to have , a large role to play in the surrounding world
I am concerned , however , about enlargement , which is passed over almost in silence in the conclusions from the Council meeting
We cannot use the referenda as pretexts for putting enlargement on ice in any way
The enlargement of just over a year ago to include ten new Member States is a brilliant success for the whole of the European idea
Unifying East and West is the best thing we have done
The European home , which does not at the moment perhaps feel so warm and cosy , must be open to our neighbouring countries when they fulfil the necessary requirements
We cannot convey the impression of the enlargement process too being put on hold and of their having to wait
the answer to their questions
Soon , it will be the summer recess for all our institutions
There is perhaps more need than ever to take a few weeks‚Äô rest , to pause for reflection and to reflect upon how we are to move on
I believe that , in the long run , something good will prove to have come out of this crisis
the whole of European cooperation , for that would be disastrous
bedecking you today
the referendum and pressing on with the ratification process
six of them , and that country will be little Luxembourg
uniting people over the mere claim to be uniting markets , market forces and resources
Today and tomorrow see two Europes meeting head-on in this Chamber
The President-in-Office gave us a thoughtful speech , reminding us of the case for a political Europe
might , by competition , nationalistic egoism and hegemonistic politics , to a Europe that is not ours
public , but that they will be used in the manner in which they were intended , as a means of moving Europe forward
‚Äì Madam President , I really appreciate Mr Juncker and , when I think that he will be succeeded by Mr Blair , I appreciate him even more
My political group , in contrast to the petty interests and demagogy of Mr Blair and a number of others , wants a stronger Community budget
We want a Europe with ambitions and solidarity for its citizens: more united , stronger , more social , more democratic and with a stronger European Parliament
We say a clear 'no' to neoliberalism , to regressing into ethnocentricity , to the conversion of the Union to a free trade zone
It is unthinkable that the message of the 'no' from the peoples of France and the Netherlands should be ignored
The Community budget , which some consider to be overly high , accounts for a mere 2
5% of the Member States' public spending
It has increased over the last seven years by a mere 8% , while national budgets have increased by 23%
That is why concessions in the face of the coercive tactics of the Six must stop
Madam President , I was surprised to find out about the initial steps that were taken towards reflection within the European institutions
obstructing the reflection on Europe‚Äôs future
Moreover , the Summit of 16 and 17 June clearly underlines the collapse of this Constitution
refuses to do anything for poor countries
In that sense , a reflection on the subject of ‚Äòdiplomatic choice of words‚Äô is of primary importance for Paris
Moreover , theimpasse surrounding the EU‚Äôs multi-annual budget cannot be seen in isolation from the current institutional crisis in Europe
The discussion about the EU‚Äôs future budget is closely related to the debate about the European Constitution
the EU‚Äôs mandate are still in full swing
The European Union must take the public‚Äôs objections about the speed and course of the European integration process seriously
The citizens want sound European cooperation in respect of which national interests are not immediately labelled as selfish or nationalistic
The public wants a Europe that does not get caught up in federal dreams but that tackles cross-border issues dynamically
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I speak on behalf of the Italian Socialists of the New Italian Socialist Party
As we had cause to highlight before the Council , clear and urgent decisions on the strategy for the forthcoming years are needed for Europe
courage is required to clearly aim at a free and competitive economic system and system of social organisation , which can cope with the ongoing processes of globalisation
policies and by means of a debate designed to generate interest , involving the citizens , civil society and the social partners
A fresh challenge , a large-scale commitment , an ambitious course of action , rightly begun by the Luxembourg Presidency , which will be continued by Mr Blair
greater transparency
I believe that the President of your government was expressing everybody's feelings when he said quite clearly that he felt ashamed
the same time they demand a drastic reduction in their contribution to the Union‚Äôs budgets
It is not acceptable for certain governments to complain about their net contribution to the European Union without taking account of their commercial balance with the other Member States
The case of Germany in relation to certain Member States , such as my own , Spain , speaks volumes
Germany's net deficit with the European Union is less than my country‚Äôs commercial deficit with , in fact , Germany
Neither is it acceptable , Mr Schmit , that certain Heads of Government should say one thing within the Council and then say something quite different to the media in their countries
then changed their minds and voted against
I would ask you to respond
transparent , however shameful they may be
Finally , Minister , I would like to wish you the best of luck on the 10th
the financial perspectives in the European Council
at a crucial moment of crisis , they have been unable to show any positive sign of a forward-looking political vision
and taking account of the economic difficulties faced by certain Member States , it has proposed slightly lower figures than those proposed by the Commission
Both the Commission and Parliament have done their duty
of European integration and confidence amongst the citizens
272 of the Treaty and will try to establish annually the figures that this Parliament has approved with a view to guaranteeing Community action
We still want to make progress with European integration and we therefore need the resources that this House has indicated in its capacity as budgetary authority
to advocate that we must spend more money on policies which create more added value and less on agriculture
What were certain people thinking in October 2002 , when they approved the spending for the period we are dealing with
We must respect the commitments we have made
For the Socialist Group , and for the Council as well , I hope , the Lisbon Strategy and , hence , economic and social cohesion , are the mid-term development objective
We would be delighted to have many more resources , we are aware of the achievements of governmental cooperation in relation to the Lisbon objectives
I would therefore like to point out that all policies ultimately find their expression in the budget
project
Gentlemen of the Council ‚Äî and I say gentlemen because there are no ladies ‚Äî on behalf of my Group , I would ask you to show responsibility
The ‚Äòno‚Äô in the referenda and the lack of agreement in the Council are simply two sides of the same coin
Madam President , last week‚Äôs European Council was a great disappointment
No agreement could be reached on its own view regarding the new financial perspective , although the current one is due to expire next year
Accordingly , it is an urgent matter to establish a new one
The European Parliament decided on its own position at the start of June
That decision was reached after a full examination of all the EU‚Äôs main policy areas
That is why Parliament‚Äôs conclusions are clear and sound
The summit discussions were dominated by the quarrel between Great Britain and France over Britain‚Äôs rebate and the EU‚Äôs agricultural policy
Rarely , hardly ever in fact , have the Member State‚Äôs shares of net contributions become such dominant issues as now
Perhaps the only solution to the argument is to be found in the joint financing of agricultural subsidies , which Parliament is hinting at
Its gradual implementation at the same time as a reduction in Great Britain‚Äôs rebate could create an adequate basis for a compromise
The EU needs an interinstitutional agreement on the financial framework
of the different policy areas
Most multi-annual programmes will be discontinued at the end of 2006
Of these , the main ones concern regional and structural policy , rural development , research and development policy , and many other areas
will be available in the form of appropriations
The situation seems to become especially problematic with regard to the one issue that really is the focal point of the financial perspective , which is increased competitiveness
The intention is to treble research and development funds for growth and employment , the funding of training programmes , and Trans-European networks
The situation mow seems quite wretched
The funding would already have been halved in the proposals for a compromise , and now we do not have any finance policies at all
Regional and structural policy also demands a solution
should be put on hold for nearly three years
The Member States and the Commission did not have time to draw up and adopt the programmes faster
cohesion policy
The next country to hold the presidency , Great Britain , cannot expect to while away the time doing nothing: we expect it to come up with proposals and solutions
Madam President , to prove Europe is really united we have to listen to what European people are telling us
proposals of the elected representatives and the will of the majority of citizens
are going in the right direction on some issues
We cannot forget a stateless nation‚Äôs rights as a part of the human , cultural , language and citizenship rights that are needed for the united Europe that we want to build
Nowadays we have to listen and learn: learn from old mistakes , such as trying to build a European Union only on nation states; and listen to European citizens
It could be that new EU Member States understand Members from stateless nations very clearly
Most of the new Member States are new European states , but with a wild history like ours
We all need to build new bridges and deal with new ideas to implement a European Union where everyone could be fully recognised
If we continue going the wrong way; if we persist only in the Jacobinical model , the European Union will not succeed
‚Äì Madam President , the Council does not have the courage to bury the Treaty
How can we talk of putting something off when it has already been killed off
There can be no resurrection for something that cannot be saved
The Council also lacks vision
Its President‚Äôs frankness only serves to show in stark relief the truth hidden from Europe by its governments
A prisoner of national egos , the Council has no political ambition of its own and tries to make omelettes without breaking eggs
With that shopkeeper mentality , we are doomed to fail
With the French vote , there is a before and an after
Either Europe wants to be purely a market or it endeavours to dig deeper and move forward by paying careful attention to the social reasons behind the referenda
Public opinion is the most significant new element to emerge from this crisis
This new player does not want less Europe , but , rather , more and better Europe
but , rather , to have a Europe that is provided with its own resources and that is characterised by greater solidarity and a greater ability to combat unemployment
Madam President , the referenda in France and the Netherlands and last week‚Äôs summit genuinely revealed the European project as an elite project without grass-roots support
Calling the people‚Äôs decision a crisis clearly demonstrates a genuine lack of belief in a democratic Europe
We must now state that the draft Constitution has come to nothing according to the EU‚Äôs own rules
Two founder countries have already rejected it
The matter is clear , so the question is: what shall we do now
In my view , we must arrange a new Convention that must be appointed democratically so as to reflect the peoples‚Äô opinions on this issue and not the elite‚Äôs
Three different issues must not then be mixed up , as has now happened
It was an attempt to impose upon the people of Europe something they did not want
Firstly , there is a need to edit together treaties that have already been entered into so that they are clear and easy to understand
That is no great political issue
Rather , it is just a matter of simple editing
Secondly , we must revise the form to be taken by the rules for decision-making in those areas in which we have already said that we must take joint decisions
in this context
Such issues should not be included in what looks like a Constitution
Instead , these are issues for the people of Europe to debate in the future
form of a Convention
for mutual appreciation by the people at the top of the EU‚Äôs political establishment
That sort of thing will not , however , do anything to help get Europe through the doubly grave crisis in which it finds itself
the Heads of Government , the will towards a common way forward cannot be assumed
is that the EU is in a crisis and will not find it easy to extricate itself from it
That having been said , this crisis should afford the opportunity for a radical change of direction , for a reorientation of the way Europe is going
of self-determining peoples and mature citizens
That is what the opportunity for radical change ought to mean
Madam President , for the first time in my life I find myself in the strange position of agreeing at least in some respects with Tony Blair
I believe he is right to call for a fundamental reform of the way the EU is funded , with particular focus on the common agricultural policy
our workforce work in agriculture
Nor can it be right that although the CAP cake has to be shared between 25 Member States , one country gets a gigantic 23
4 per cent slice
is happily voting for an annual subsidy to Europe‚Äôs tobacco farmers of more than EUR 1 billion
Reform , however , is needed across a much wider field than simply the CAP
The people of France and the Netherlands showed us that we have lost touch with our own electors
It was a valuable lesson that we would do well to learn
brave deeds
citizens
Do we really believe that this will increase our competitive advantage in the global market
Do we think this will achieve the goals of the Lisbon Strategy
I do not think so
It was a wake-up call from the French and the Dutch
Wake up and smell the coffee
Madam President , Mr Juncker expressed his regret at having to give up being President-in-Office of the Council after only six months
If the Constitution were in force , he would be able to be elected for two and a half years
Perhaps the summit has shown how important it is that the Council should develop in that direction
involves proceeding with ratification while continuing with a debate ‚Äì the great debate about Europe
You , Vice-President Wallstr√∂m , now have in your hand the key that will unlock communication with the public in relation to the European project
This is the right strategy , and I wholeheartedly endorse it
for agreement to the Constitution
We now need to debate what the EU is for and why we need it
and the question of how much wider we may set them , not to mention transparency and democracy within the EU
What I saw as missing from the summit resolution was any concept of how the debate should be structured
It is not enough to have 25 national debates in isolation from each other
We have to bring them together and create a synthesis right across the EU
a good idea to hold an ad hoc assembly of the European Parliament and the national parliaments on that sort of platform
I hope in any case , though , that what comes out of this crisis will be a stronger Europe and a Europe closer to its people
undergo a genuine crisis , will enable the European Union to redefine its mission and to endow it with intelligence , institutions , organisation and resources
That does not diminish our sense of gratitude towards you
of European history has definitely come to an end , as a result of the success achieved
The way in which every issue is now rapidly globalised obliges us to embark upon another period , which is just as challenging , not to say just as exciting
is still absent
guarantee the objectives that the European people believe are no longer achievable with the Union of today
life into the work of the Union
and the impetus provided by the Lisbon Strategy are facts that remain , to the credit of the Luxembourg Presidency
utilise every political resource in order to keep the process in balance , whilst allowing itself time to refocus on the fundamental objectives and methods of its own work
decisions , even starting with only apparently modest results , such as the European driving licence , which I hope can be approved in a few days‚Äô time thanks to our codecision procedure
Mr President , the President-in-Office of the Council said that Europe ought to have shown some maturity
is high time that we compel it to meet in public , which might perhaps be some help
Tony Blair , the British Prime Minister , is now calling for a radical reform of agricultural policy
We are ready for it
from being capped or staggered
He blocked the social cohesion that the coupling of premiums to each worker would have achieved
He prevented , and voted against , the reallocation of funds to the second pillar for innovation , work and the environment and for the economic development of rural areas
that the rebate be brought back onto the agenda
spoken about a window of opportunity to cut a quick deal on the EU budget , including the British rebate
We pointed out that Mr Juncker was under the impression that he could revise in just six months arrangements that had taken five years to negotiate
I do not know whether Mr Juncker was being naive or arrogant , but last week he counted the cost of it
Chirac who wished to distract attention from the French ‚Äòno‚Äô vote
In fact the rebate was always going to be discussed last week because Mr Juncker was determined it should be
His window of opportunity was almost closed , the curtain rapidly falling across his presidency
Mr Juncker is right about one thing: the EU is in profound crisis and for that we can look back in gratitude upon his six months at its helm
I would also like to thank Mr Juncker for his verdict on the French and Dutch ‚Äòno‚Äô votes
attitude of the EU‚Äôs political elite in the 21st century
I come from Devon , where we are often referred to as simple country folk
Despite ‚Äì or perhaps because of ‚Äì my simplistic outlook on life , I found the EU Constitution incredibly easy to understand
It is abundantly clear that if you wish to see your country retain its independence , you have to vote ‚Äòno‚Äô
Clearly the French and the Dutch share a Devonian‚Äôs ability to understand it
What part of the word ‚Äòno‚Äô does Mr Juncker not understand
Mr President , for those who still cling to the European dream , Mr Juncker‚Äôs presidency has been a stunning failure
its currency
From this , however , some good could come
If the effect was to jolt European leaders into the same reality stream that many of their people already occupy , then a workable Europe could emerge
parliaments
A Europe built on sovereign states trading and cooperating for mutual benefit , and not for the unworkable , unwanted ever-closer union , has some hope of success
This present Europe , as your presidency demonstrates , Mr Juncker , cannot work
policy
However , the debate , on the initiative in particular of one country , has opened up and gone beyond the bounds of the predefined Brussels agenda
For example , the subject of the common agricultural policy has been raised
up to 2013
I wonder if they would all be prepared to set an example by cutting back the budgets for their large-scale farmers
The south of Europe cannot pay for the costs of enlargement , nor can the previous cohesion countries
The subject of a new model for Europe has also been raised , but every model for Europe requires financing
More Europe also means more money
We cannot talk about a new vision for Europe with just 2
5% of public spending at European level making up the Community budget
What Europe needs today more than ever is bold and visionary leadership; leadership which looks to future generations , rather than to future elections
Our political leadership should not present Europe either as a 'coat hanger' for its responsibilities or as a necessary evil
We must show the citizens what Europe really is: a decision in favour of peace , cooperation , development and social cohesion
which was respectful of the institutions and very democratic
I think that , in the years to come , whenever the situation becomes difficult , we will refer to this method
Having said that , it is with real bitterness that I now address you following this summit and its result regarding , in particular , the financial perspectives
Far be it from me to be provocative , but I am personally embarrassed and even ashamed at the image of national egotism presented by some European states
Overly attached to their historical advantages , they have been taught a valuable lesson in Europe by the new countries
Once again , the Council has illustrated a political adage from Corr√®ze: promises only bind those who believe in them
The citizens , though , are starting to no longer believe
job , a place in our society
Keeping your word is doubtless an antiquated , outmoded virtue , but , at the foot of the budgetary wall , the Council‚Äôs word disappeared into thin air
What we were afraid of in Parliament , therefore , happened in the Council
The resolution that we broadly adopted , though , was very moderate in view of our projects and , over seven years , enabled certain policies to be developed realistically
That is my only satisfaction as an MEP and as a European citizen
resumed the progression of a true political project
Each country still needs to be convinced that the added value that we gain as 25 Member States is much greater than our contributions to the European budget
that , together , we can confront reality and future challenges
Stability and Growth Pact , the relaunch of the Lisbon Agenda , the ratification of the Constitution and the financial perspectives
The Luxembourg Presidency , in its commendable effort to address them all , has confirmed its own political ability and its determined support for the Community project
a relationship that is genuinely based on the element of trust
I must , however , add , Minister , that I was not so impressed with the position of the current Presidency on the resources for the cohesion policy in the next programming period
in fact , if it were translated into an agreement , would not have provided an adequate response to the demands for balanced development in the regions lagging behind
Commission
Is it possible that all of that is of no importance whatsoever
Is it possible , therefore , not to take account of the opinion of 426 ‚Äì that was how many of us voted ‚Äì democratically elected Members
soon as possible , without indulging in the extended time still available
should like to start by expressing a degree of satisfaction
tricky summit has approved the integrated guidelines
What this shows is that social cohesion , sustainable development and the new emphasis on growth and jobs remain priorities shared by the three institutions
We know that the Member States play a leading part in this strategy , now and in future , but also that Europe has a task of its own
not , or is in any case insufficiently , forthcoming
It is shameful for various reasons , which have been explained here by others , certainly in respect of the new Member States
What is particularly unfortunate is the embarrassing manner in which the lack of political will to further develop the European Union together was exposed
And to develop it into what
Let us make good use of the active period of reflection , which we do , after all , have at our disposal
jobs , who worry about their companies relocating and who are frightened by immigration
which they do not know to be guided in one way or another
Should there be a supreme being , should Zeus still be around , he should be able to fall in love with Europa once again
I think we should ensure that we offer the people a Europe of that kind , a Europe with charisma , a Europe that is attractive once more
The Luxembourg Presidency is now coming to an end
I am sure that I speak for many when I say that I continue , even once June is past , to count on your commitment and your conviction
I also think that I speak for many , Mr Juncker , when I say that we are grateful for your transparency and your honesty
the European Council disaster
To paraphrase Mr Juncker , the European Council was not a failure of the Presidency , but a failure of Europe
It was a huge disappointment
The citizens expected a strong message , but received a response that was devoid of quality , of ambition and of a rallying idea
The Union thus missed out on a unique opportunity to convey an image of strong , unified leadership
European leaders were not equal to the task that history had set them
National interests prevailed over the Union‚Äôs values and selfishness spoke louder than solidarity
Let us now take this opportunity to look for answers to the citizens‚Äô questions , such as: What is Europe‚Äôs role in the world
How do we increase productivity and competitiveness in a globalised world
How do we reduce unemployment
How do we implement social cohesion
What social model should we follow
Europe may be at a crossroads , but history teaches us that it is at times of crisis that the best transformations can be effected
Let us hope that we prove capable of transforming difficulties into opportunities
The world has changed and the citizens‚Äô concerns and needs have changed
The EU must keep up and must begin by forging a new relationship with the citizens
Change does not mean changing something so that everything remains the same , as one of Lampedusa‚Äôs characters suggested ‚Äì that would be a confidence trick
Europe can live without a Constitutional Treaty , but it is doubtful whether it could live without agreement on the Financial Perspective
Europe must be a political Union , an area of cohesion and solidarity , and not merely a free trade area
This is the challenge facing the forthcoming Presidency , which I hope is capable of giving us a pleasant surprise
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I rise to put the case for proactive reflection rather than turning round and going back
We are glad that Europe can again breathe with two lungs
In the Council , there appear to be those who are playing the ‚Äònew for old‚Äô and ‚Äòfuture not past‚Äô cards
and transparency in their own countries
the institutions , believing as they do that they can cope on their own
others rather than share responsibility and opt for egoism rather than solidarity
agreed
yes to the Constitutional Treaty
If you want to replace egoism with solidarity , you have to contend for the social market economy
If you want to stop the majority being held to ransom by the minority , you have to want a stronger Europe of citizens and parliaments
stage really must be committed to thinking , designing and implementing the federal state , the united states of Europe
Mr President , Mr Juncker , Commissioner , I would like to start by thanking President Juncker for the way in which he reported on this European Council
I think that it was a great moment to hear a description of the work of the European Council , in application of the concept of transparency
It was very useful for such a report to be given in this House
I thank him , too , for the conclusions to which he managed to bring the European Council with regard to ratification of the Constitution
I think that each population is free to decide whether or not it wants to continue with this process
In addition , a pause is vital because what can we do when a question is asked and we do not have the answer
Nobody yet knows what the French or Dutch will say in future , on what text , under what conditions
It is a question that is still ahead of us
I would , however , like to give certain speakers and perhaps the Members of the Commission or others a warning
Saying that there is a problem of communication , and that it is because of this communication problem that two referenda resulted in a ‚Äòno‚Äô , is a mistake
It is to imagine that the citizens do not understand
That is what this argument implies
in a way , advocating a return to selective suffrage
I do not imagine that anyone in this House would call for such a development
On the issue of the budget , I think that the Luxembourg Presidency has tried everything
The question is not really whether we are faced with national egos
It is whether we want to continue with a strategy of going the extra mile and of European added value
to be favoured by some , must finally be sent back to the drawing board
In that respect , I think , Mr Juncker , that you have made some good proposals
We must continue with this debate
What I think is a shame is that , in the end , the grand ambitions of the Lisbon Strategy will not be served by the financial perspectives they need
in , and which has been precipitated by the dramatic way in which the public have denied us their allegiance
That much is apparent from what the voters in France and the Netherlands have done , and in doing it they surely represent many others
Their motivations as individuals may differ , but what underlies them can be found throughout the European Union
If we are to regain the public‚Äôs confidence , we have to bring about a change in direction and a change in European politics
I have only a few comments to make on this
For a start , we do not want a constitution
The mere term ‚Äòconstitution‚Äô is redolent of a European superstate; nobody wants one , and we are not even trying to build one
Parliament and Commission ‚Äì relate to one another
We need the Charter of Fundamental Rights in an agreed form
an orderly fashion
We have to enable the public to understand and get a handle on enlargement , and that means that Europe needs borders
in Europe would feel themselves affronted if the accession negotiations with Turkey were to start on 3 October
What is needed is a privileged partnership with Turkey , rather than for it to become a Member State
My final point is that a new culture of subsidiarity is called for in the Commission‚Äôs bureaucracy
The Commission must give thought to how many regulations have to be enacted in Brussels and about the point at which the Member States should assume responsibility
form of the tsunami
Now , you are concluding your Presidency with a summit that has produced neither decisions on the budget nor a new treaty
Unfortunately , few people talk about the excellent foreign policy decisions taken
Thank you for all you have achieved
During its period of office , Luxembourg has ensured that Bulgaria and Romania will become Members and that Turkey will be allowed to begin negotiations in October
You have made history , and I would thank you for that
Europe is emphatically not in crisis , because the debate is most certainly not now about countries wanting to leave the EU
a state of affairs that would be better for the future
fight against crime , sustainable development and gender equality
At long last , we are obtaining a debate in our Member States about the future in which Europeans now wish to participate
it
I am hopeful and I look forward to a lively debate , but this time involving everyone who wishes to participate
Let us not therefore wear sackcloth and ashes , be issued with yellow cards or be depressed
We should pause for thought but not be passive
Let us challenge people and call for them to be committed and to provide answers to questions as guidance on how we want the EU to develop
We need to listen more and talk less
That is difficult for us politicians , but it would mean that we should emerge strengthened from this period of reflection
Finally , the debate is about politics and the future and objectives of the EU , and it is something I welcome
Mr President , while we , along with everyone else , regret that no financial agreement has been reached , I think that we should also consider the positive aspects
the B√∂ge report
In the Council too , the differences have become more negligible than many people had thought possible
I appreciate the presidency‚Äôs efforts in this respect and also what Mr Juncker said , namely that he tried to reach out to the Netherlands even further
I am not saying this for selfish reasons , but only to indicate that a country such as the Netherlands does not mind paying up
will eventually end up being sceptical
The Netherlands will soon need to get back on track in a referendum , and we must all find our bearings again
We must also learn from those referenda
There were many reasons for the no-vote
Something that definitely played a role is a certain fear among people of how fast enlargements are carried out and of where they will stop
We must explain in more specific terms that enlargements are not detrimental to us , but beneficial and what they have brought us
We must also ensure that the enlargement processes that are currently underway remain credible
be put in place to this effect
We all carry some of the responsibility in this , not least with regard to the criterion that Europe must be able to handle the enlargements
We have not had an easy time of it , and if anyone was able to cope , it was this President of the Council , Mr Juncker , and his team
and during negotiations , but also here today when he reminded us about the end of the Second World War sixty years ago with all the empathy one would expect
on as he has begun , we will soon harvest what the Luxembourg Presidency has sowed during this difficult time
I thank you , I thank the Presidency , and let us continue the good work
leaders as something self-evident , but they are not
at this very time of crisis , place in much sharper focus the dilemma we now face
a common market , and in this sense take a step backwards
Almost twenty years ago now , it was determined correctly that a common market alone could not provide an adequate response to the challenging issues facing Europe
And twenty years later this idea can respond to these needs so much less
fundamental issues
entire budget to agriculture , while we are so effortlessly willing to cut financing for the fundamental measures and instruments of the Lisbon strategy: science , education and technology
I believe that these are the relevant , fundamental issues that we should now be addressing
And the more courageously we respond to these issues , the greater our chances will be of finding a good solution to the bind in which we find ourselves
financial perspectives to us , sounded like an auditor heading a team of accountants
And I would put the question: who was talking about Europe when the financial perspectives were being negotiated
Nobody talked about Europe
Everybody talked about their national interests
Actually that is not true , Mr President: some people talked about Europe , those we call the ‚Äònew countries‚Äô talked about Europe , the countries of the last enlargement
been given by the new countries
I therefore propose that we stop calling them ‚Äònew countries‚Äô , because they have shown that they do not need to take lessons in Europeanism from anybody
Like Mr Lamassoure , I too believe that we will certainly have to reflect upon the system of own resources
We tried that in the Convention ‚Äî some of you will remember ‚Äî but there was no way of introducing anything
In fact , there was a small group in the European Convention considering how to introduce a new system of own resources into the Constitution
We will have to return to this issue
not the right time to hold more referenda and we must dedicate ourselves to debate
this Parliament must begin to consider what it is going to do in the future
determination that Mr Juncker urged us to show and that I am sure this Parliament will agree with
with determination , which it signed , like the governments of the other 24 Member States , on 29 October 2004
Secondly , on having maintained its referendum
is not on its knees‚Äô
furthermore it is useful , not just for the Europeans , but also for the rest of the world
We should reflect , I agree , but to what end
overtake us
No , not for that reason: we must reflect so that we can continue to make progress , that is to say , to bring the European Constitution into being
take , the citizens must express their opinion on it , either directly or by means of their parliaments
there have been three referenda: the first was in my country , with 77
7% voting in favour of the European Constitution
more countries have said yes to the European Constitution than no
But we are facing the usual problem: a genuine debate between Eurosceptics and Europeanists , between those who want more Europe and those who want less Europe
better Europe , a more democratic and more efficient Europe
And that is why we need this Constitution , which is a point of balance , but above all a point of progress
his team
political Presidency and an effective Presidency
the British rebate and of the funding of the common rural policy , which represents , I would remind you , just 0
4% of the EU‚Äôs GDP
to regret
I think that there is one subject on which the Council has been particularly discreet , to a certain extent appropriately , and that is the subject of enlargement
has no budget and Turkey has slackened its efforts
back into its own hands by being able to state where its borders are
work
This was confirmed in the most decisive manner by the Luxembourg Presidency , by Mr Juncker personally and by the foreign ministers , Mr Asselborn and Mr Schmit
The European cycle gave the Presidency to Luxembourg at a particularly critical turn on the path towards European unification
Following the negative referenda in France and the Netherlands , the European Union is now in a state of institutional , political and strategic crisis
on the subject of the new financial perspectives
At this European Council , it was not only political will that was lacking
Unfortunately , there was a serious lack of political leadership and management of European developments
It is a European Council of political confusion and political cowardice , as the conclusions record
It is a European Council of the deconstruction and deregulation of the objective of deepening European integration
It is a European Council of the deconstruction of political union and social cohesion
It is a European Council typified by the fear of the leaders in the face of the fear of the citizens
A typical example is the reference to the enlargement procedure
conclusions , to a strategic plan to foster peace , security , stability , development and , more importantly , the political and social democratisation of the candidate countries
A strategic plan which gave people hope of breaking out of the vicious circle of underdevelopment and autocracy and putting European principles and values into practice
and xenophobic political forces in Europe
The Luxembourg Presidency was lucky to have institutional backing for its difficult task from the European Parliament
At the same time , however , it was unlucky to have next to it a cowardly and weak President of the European Commission with no political vision
To close , I must say that , above all , the Luxembourg Presidency had the courage to go ahead with the referenda in these difficult times
votes on the Constitution
The decision to pause for reflection on the Constitution merely underlines a lack of direction across Europe
When two founding Member States reject the Constitution with no expectation of holding a second vote , it is hard to see the logic of continuing the ratification process
We would have preferred the Council to have acted decisively , accepted the will of the voters and moved on
Of course there still is a time for a real debate about Europe‚Äôs future
Like the British Government , we believe that Europe must face up to some profound questions
The move to political integration has reached its high water mark
rejected the constitution
Such statements damage the relationship between politicians and the people , and if ever there was a time for politicians to demonstrate that they are listening , it is now
It would be folly for Europe‚Äôs leaders just to ignore the reality of what has happened
This crisis was avoidable: for many years my party has argued for a more flexible Europe
For too long the European integration process has carried on as a project of the political elite
That is now over and we , the representatives of the people , are now charged with conducting further debate on the kind of Europe we want to see
Those of us who have opposed that integration process have often been criticised , and many in this Chamber believe it is the only way forward , but it is not
Europe that gets away from the obsessions of the past and moves forward with the people‚Äôs real agenda , which is jobs , growth and prosperity
That is the way to re-engage the electorate with the European Union
I regret that on this occasion the Council failed to show the necessary leadership
done over the last six months
He has demonstrated , yet again , that it is quality and vision that count in the construction of Europe
I would also like to express my admiration for the new Member States , for their solidarity and forward-looking effort to avoid the breakdown of the budget negotiations
As has been said repeatedly , they are not the cause of the problems of Europe
They in fact give us far more and offer us far more in terms of a peaceful , secure and prosperous future than we can offer them
included in any debate now about the future of Europe
kind of Europe we are going to have
Today Mr Juncker gave us a master class in transparency , frankness and humanity
and all Commissioners meet with the standards set by Mr Juncker today
My group leader , Mr Schulz , has launched a five-point European agenda which seeks to kick-start the process of re-establishing the self-confidence of Europeans
Europe that we have a future together
We must ensure that we do not leave the people of Europe to the likes of Mr Bonde and his ilk in other parts of Europe
Europe which is locked behind its own sovereign borders , unable to share power and unable to share a future together
very honest and comprehensive speech
That is why I should like to convey to him a personal thank you and also thank the entire Luxembourg presidency for its extremely important work
It is a great pity that the success that we had hoped for is still to be achieved
Now some words on the essence of the problem
Evidently , our electors , our people still do not understand that we face new challenges
people and allowed them to take common decisions more easily and to vote for them , none of that is present now
Perhaps people still do not perceive or understand this new challenge , this global competition that Europe faces , and not just every one individually , but Europe as a whole
That is why this medicine , this Constitutional Treaty , is essential
the demographic situation , which unfortunately is not a progressive one for Europe
I know that it is not progressive for my nation , but neither is it progressive for the whole of Europe
If we are becoming fewer , then every individual must be of a higher quality
Therefore our chief task is to invest in people , in people‚Äôs education; that is our future
Mr President , the European crisis that has resulted from two referenda is a clear indication that the political elite is not in touch with the people
There is such an enormous difference between the propaganda and reality that the voters have stopped listening
to believe anything else that is said
The mood now is that a referendum can be organised on any issue at all , and the answer will always be no
The leaders of nations have only themselves to blame
to it by taking the right decisions
implemented in their own
Instead , Brussels is blamed for the problems and setbacks
Referenda are not entirely appropriate as a tool of pan-European decision-making
National governments and parliaments should have the courage to make the necessary decisions
Explaining and justifying European policy is always a local issue , if we want people to understand our good intentions
contributions originated in former times and in different circumstances
institutional crisis
and on the other supporters of a Europe limited to the single market , with a looser institutional framework
The point I should like to stress is that the EU‚Äôs future is not a matter of choosing between these two approaches
to compete on a global scale
The incoming British presidency has gained considerable popularity in Central Europe as a result of its efforts to drive forward financial reform and economic modernisation
Yet such efforts must not go hand in hand with a weakening of the institutions
stone
We must settle the political dispute over economic and social strategies within the bounds of the existing institutional playing field
content of specific policies
In other words , it must not attempt to mark out the playing field while deciding who has scored how many goals in which net
a more stable institutional framework on the basis of Parts One and Two of the Constitution
I too should like to start with a few words of thanks
I should like to thank the Luxembourg presidency for its work , which has been both highly professional and of first-rate quality
I should also like to thank the President-in-Office of the European Council , Jean-Claude Juncker
also play a large role in Europe
In order to do so , they must remain true to the ideas that underpinned the gradual construction of Europe after the Second World War
I refer to such ideas as Europeanism , solidarity and the placing of European interests before individual , and often selfish , national interests
countries of Central and Eastern Europe
States that so desire to continue the ratification process
I believe that the people of Luxembourg will vote ‚Äòyes‚Äô in the referendum to be held on 10 July
I hope that politicians in other countries , including my own country , the Czech Republic , will be equally courageous and allow their citizens to take part in referenda
I should like to raise one final issue that has not yet been touched upon , namely EU enlargement
Accession treaties were signed with Bulgaria and Romania during the Luxembourg presidency
absolutely the right one
the interests of our history
the Constitution or to last weekend‚Äôs summit
I believe that Romania and Bulgaria will act equally responsibly after they join in 2007 or 2008
Mr President , I would like to make three points
running presidencies in general
The speech today from Jean-Claude Juncker was one of the best that we have heard in this House for many years
Secondly , we need a positive vision
I am sick and tired of listening to everyone blaming everyone , coming up with scapegoats
The two worst scapegoats that I have heard so far are firstly enlargement and secondly the liberalisation of markets
I do not think the results of the two referenda or the European Council should mean that we close the borders of Europe and stop competitiveness
Quite the contrary: the best thing that has happened to us in the past ten years are the last two rounds of enlargement
We must avoid protectionism and we must avoid nationalism
The third and final point that I wanted to make is that in Europe we now have a leadership vacuum
It is clear that France and Germany are no longer the engine of Europe
Someone needs to come and pick up the pieces and drive things forward
In the media it seems that Tony Blair would be the person
If Tony Blair is the person , he needs to do two things
Firstly , he needs to argue for more , not less Europe
Secondly , he needs to combine this with economic reform
the heart of Europe in the past is something that can be called ‚ÄòNATO‚Äô: ‚Äòno action , talk only‚Äô
Mr President , sadly , I do not believe that the statements given here today deliver on the expectations of our citizens
They do little to restore the credibility of the EU as a global player
Furthermore they will not deliver on a forward-thinking budget that the 21st century EU requires
The opportunity to overhaul the EU budget and to leave behind the antiquated system has , I believe , been missed both by the Commission and the Council
We are now faced with a budget where the only flagship policy is agriculture
same time , the largest net beneficiary
The Europe of today needs to face up to the challenges ahead and we need to learn this lesson now
Our citizens want us to create a better Europe , which means more economic growth and employment stability
Therefore , Mr President-in-Office , how can you justify cuts in the very areas that people want in terms of research funding , growth and jobs
Clearly we are not listening or delivering on our citizens‚Äô priorities
Finally , with regard to transparency , many people are asking why these talks are taking place behind closed doors
I suggest that if the Council wants to connect with the people out there , then it should leave these doors open and let the citizens hear the debate
All I can say is that I hope the UK presidency will make this its number one priority
Roll on the British presidency
dominated the last meeting of the European Council
Point one: procedure for ratifying the Constitution
The entry into a period of rethinking is bringing to the surface creative material for institutional , political and strategic self-criticism
My question to the Vice-President of the Commission is this: how does the Commission intend to address citizens' criticism about over-regulation and the excessive technicality of legislative proposals
Seriously , what has become of the White Paper on European governance
My question to the President-in-Office of the Council is this: is there sufficient consultation of and information for civil society before and after the adoption of decisions by the Council
discussion of the stated will of the people , of the
The only way out of the constitutional and political crisis is to establish a permanent , transparent and democratic dialogue with civil society
towards the option of reinforced cooperation
Œ§he second point refers to the financial perspectives: we are being called upon to realise that ambitious objectives require the necessary financial resources
Enlargement also requires enlarged resources
old and new Member States , a Europe of stability , of solidarity and of social prosperity
It is to this eminent political position that the common agricultural policy aspires
Like many of my colleagues , I would like to begin by thanking Luxembourg's Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker , the President of the European Council and his colleagues
I awaited the results of the European Council in Vilnius , Lithuania , and watched Mr Juncker's press conference on television after midnight on Thursday
He looked very well and his emotion did little harm , but some others , to put it mildly , did not look so good
I do not doubt that the new Member States , including Lithuania , will appreciate the last six months of the presidency and the personal contribution made by Mr Juncker
Luxembourg has clearly demonstrated that the well-known definition of this state as ‚Äòsmall , but notable‚Äô is true
What would the European Union be without you
ambitions of certain political leaders , but to common values and solidarity without denying internal competition , the engine of all progress
the nature of the United Kingdom's vision of the European Union , we also ought to analyse the cause of the current situation very carefully
qualified they are
renewed disillusionment
in the future
We also notice that the most sensitive issues today are employment , new jobs , the growth of economic competition and the further expansion of the European Union
These should be the signposts in our dialogue with the citizens of the European Union
Mr President , the Council President is known throughout Europe as an excellent and experienced negotiator
We have to look elsewhere to find the reasons why we are standing here today empty-handed
Many people have spoken here today about Europe‚Äôs crisis , but this is not quite right
It is not Europe‚Äôs crisis; it is the crisis of the 15 , and not only in a geographical sense
We need a new agreement , and one that clearly should cover much more than just money
Some want to speak about Lisbon , and about competitiveness
Well , let us do it
But let all twenty-five of us be involved
We cannot negotiate on competitiveness if our hands and feet are tied
We must review the regulations on free movement of persons ‚Äì it is high time in any case
We must not make the same mistake with the free movement of services as we did with persons
When we were unable to resolve an issue politically , we put up administrative barriers
Some want to speak about agricultural policy
Fine , but I would remind you that we in the ten new Member States are contributing considerably from our own resources
hand and foot once again by a multitude of administrative obstacles regarding how funds are spent , because it looks as if that is the direction we are heading in
If we need a new agreement , then one of its pillars must be to solidify the enlarged 25-member Union
Over the past decade and a half , we in the ten new Member States have vigorously cleared the hurdles , despite all the difficulties
To invigorate Europe ‚Äì as Europe seems to need such ‚Äì all twenty-five of us must strive vigorously for solidity
Over the past year , there has not been much evidence of this
Perhaps now things will change
Mr President , there can be no question that the outcome of last week‚Äôs European Council has cast a shadow on the six-month Luxembourg Presidency
A great deal has already been said about the reasons for this fiasco
was reached on the Financial Perspective
I disagree with the view that the EU is facing a long-term crisis , and I believe that the deadlock on EU expenditure will soon be broken
At the same time , however , I should like to emphasise most strongly that the new Member States must not suffer as a result
European solidarity must not fall prey to conflicts between the 15 old Member States
years to overcome the effects of the political and economic division of Europe that was imposed upon the nations of Central and Eastern Europe
The EU as a whole needs to work together to this end
It is in the vital interests of the richer Member States to invest in the new Member States in order to accelerate their development
A strong cohesion policy and free movement of services provide the best means of achieving this goal
reflection in the debate on the Constitutional Treaty
This was a very judicious move , and one that is essential if we are to maintain a healthy European democracy
The outcome of the referenda in France and the Netherlands cannot be ignored without widening the gap between Europe‚Äôs elite and its citizens
Those who have called for the ratification process to be continued without any period of reflection , as though nothing had happened , would achieve the very opposite of their intentions
They would forfeit any chance of achieving genuine democratic legitimacy for the European project , perhaps for many years to come
I am quite sure that by taking its foot off the accelerator , the Luxembourg Presidency has steered the EU round a dangerous bend as far as this issue is concerned
I should like to take the opportunity to express my particular thanks to Prime Minister Juncker and Mr Schmit for having done so
‚Äì Mr President , a whole series of my colleagues has successively congratulated the Luxembourg Presidency
and who can also stand as leaders beyond the borders of their own country
of refunds
the protection of the environment
You have promoted the Lisbon process , the failure of which to date must again be blamed on the Member States
them
good climate , between the two communities , in order to resolve our problems
to try and reach a decision on these very difficult and complex issues at the European Council last week
overcharge on its agenda , had not actually done the real thinking on the financial perspective
Therefore , to have completed a deal within the space of two weeks was perhaps a little bit beyond the capacity of the Union
No deal is better than a bad deal
Now we need to look forward and there are four points I will raise quickly
The first is to have a real debate about priorities of the Union
How can you have a financial perspective unless you know what the policy priorities are going to be
Part of that must be the economic reform agenda
Mr Watson referred to the UK and France being in Jurassic Park
I think the economies of France and Germany are the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park
We have to make sure that there is an economic dynamism that shows we can be competitive in the global economy
Second , we need to be able to fix a budget deal
Not , as Mr Barroso said , to have a seven year deal with a review
Let us come back to what we said in the Berger resolution and have a five-year deal , allowing the Commission and Parliament to review it in 2011
This way we can see how far we are going without having to predict what our expenditure will be too far into the future
In reconsidering that option we need to do more , as Mr Virrankoski said , on co-financing on agriculture
Third ‚Äì and I include two last points here ‚Äì we need to look at the question of the Constitutional Treaty
I welcome the suspension of ratification , because there are many things that are needed in terms of transparency , accountability , democracy and inclusion of national parliaments
This will be essential for a Union of the future
Last , but not least , is the question of enlargement
still expanding
Let us , as Mr Nassauer said , focus on what is really essential for our European citizens and then think about enlargement , if necessary , a little bit further on
‚Äì Mr President , the European project is currently characterised by uncertainties and concerns , yet this is also a time that encourages us to look to the future
By dint of the fact that Europe has become ambitious , it takes stock and asks itself fundamental questions
The ambition was to create an inclusive , integrated justice system , characterised by human dignity and capable of setting an example to the world
Europe drew up a Constitutional Treaty that enabled it to break free of the confines of offices and to go out onto the streets
The debate on the European Constitution has , undeniably , seen the greatest democratisation in Europe‚Äôs history
Europe is seeking a public domain characterised by transparency and trust
Ultimately , there can be no turning back on this odyssey; Europe is duty bound not to abandon this ambition of political sharing
Furthermore , Europe must not think solely on its own
Without an integrated Europe there is no European model and without a European model we cannot set an example of human dignity around the world
It is only through political integration that decision-making can be effective , that our system of values can be placed on firm foundations and that Europe can speak with one voice
part; and the media must also become involved
In this regard , the European institutions have a responsibility that they must fulfil unflinchingly , given that the European debate is not merely a sum of national debates
The Constitution fits into this process of searching for consensus in an open and fragmented reality
Through the Constitution we have a duty to raise awareness of our shared interest
as a driving force or the Constitution as a framework
Paths are made by walking
work of our Committee and its very strong commitment to the internal market
I particularly want to thank the Luxembourg presidency for the fact that , under the leadership of Minister Kreck√© , it has moved forward with the vital work on the Services Directive
that directive , of how they have sorted it out , and of how they have killed the directive in some cases
continue to work strongly with the British presidency to bring it to a conclusion and to build on the work that you have done
If I may , I would like to link that point to some of the important remarks that the President-in-Office made this afternoon
free market and a stronger political union
I would suggest , colleagues , that is not the choice at all
We have moved far beyond a free market already: an internal market is an entirely different proposition
It is a major political and economic force
know in what direction it is taking us
Surely one of the reasons why the Constitution was rejected so soundly in Holland and France was because people do not understand what a political union is
They actually feel threatened by the potential loss of sovereignty that it implies
Therefore , let us get on with the internal market
during the British presidency
assessments and , above all , for the encouragement that you have expressed during this debate
It is true that Europe is experiencing serious difficulties , but I think that these difficulties can help us
First by making us refocus on a more in-depth reflection on the development of this Europe
European integration that we must follow
I think that , if our current difficulties can help us to open those doors , to open that debate , then , in the end , they will have had a purpose
Some have referred to the idea that the negative votes were motivated by a number of concerns expressed by the citizens , particularly social concerns or those raised by globalisation
In short , all of that needs to be included in this debate , included in this dialogue with the citizens
We in Luxembourg are taking the risk of holding a debate-election , a debate-referendum: we are the ones who have stuck with the date of 10 July
It is a courageous decision , but it is a decision that was called for by the people of Luxembourg
Well , I have confidence in them and I think that , from that vote on 10 July , a clear message will emerge of continuity with the Constitution
put on ice indefinitely
I myself thought that we had got rid of the ice when we reformed the common agricultural policy , once we no longer had butter mountains
Now , though , I see that we are putting the Constitution and the financial perspectives on ice
No , Europe does not need hibernation , it needs action
Europe needs a clearly marked path
So , the time has come to pass on the baton
On the financial perspectives , we could have reached an agreement , and it is extremely regrettable that we did not do so
I think that Mr Juncker gave as transparent a report as Mr Bonde has always hoped for , as transparent as possible
We have spoken a great deal about various aspects of the negotiations
in the end
They did not do so because the current of agreement failed for the reasons of which you are aware
Many reasons have also been put forward not to accept this agreement
I have a bad feeling that , in the end , those reasons are more a pretext than real reasons
If reform becomes a pretext for not adopting important decisions for Europe , this does Europe a disservice
I tell you this , and Mr Juncker has already said it: we were prepared to make , in a declaration , a substantial commitment to reform
Well , that commitment did not see the light of day because , in the end , there was no final decision on the financial perspectives
Reform , yes , but reform in solidarity
We will not have reform without the people
We will not have reform without solidarity with everyone
The agricultural policy was also the target of a great deal of criticism
We forget rather too easily that there are , nevertheless , fundamental achievements in this agricultural policy
Who would wish for the desertification of acres of European countryside
Who wishes for that
Who would wish poverty on the rural population
Who wants that
I think that , once again , we need to debate the agricultural policy and not blame it for every problem , not demonise it , so to speak
I think that , on that subject , some honesty is needed
Primarily , and on this point I think that I am echoing Mr Baringdorf , is everybody really so innocent when we discuss agricultural policy
Does everybody think only of reforming it in one way without thinking about reforming it in another
I think that you will have many more opportunities to discuss reforms , including reform of the common agricultural policy
Do not forget , however , that there is also solidarity with the countryside , which is also a component of European culture
particularly from a revision of the Lisbon Strategy
We have no financial perspectives
was adopted by a very large majority of your Parliament
your Parliament and , of course , of the Commission too
Much has been said about a fair return
I think that it is a virus gnawing away at European solidarity: we must eradicate it
Europe really must be vaccinated against this narrow idea of a fair return
is that there has been a great deal of fiddling with the numbers
There has been much fiddling , in order to justify positions that , if they were explained a little better , would then appear much more qualified
financial perspectives , there have also been many successes
Europe is continuing to work in other fields of importance to the populations of Europe
security at our external borders , and I think that your Parliament will vote on it during this part-session
It is a success that we must not minimise and that we must not now drown in an overly negative discussion on the current state of Europe
I note , too , that there have been a dozen approvals at first reading with your Parliament on important matters , such as cross-border mergers , or concerning the internal market
I think that these are important achievements that must not be minimised
travel and who cross borders
Yes , Europe is experiencing major difficulties , but I think that a part of its destiny is now also in your hands
We want to open up a debate
That debate must take place here , and it must take place in the national parliaments , within public opinion
from these difficulties

their engagement , the passion and what I would like to call the sense of Europe that they have demonstrated
and this is what Mr Juncker especially has shown throughout the Luxembourg presidency
I would like to add that we also greatly appreciate the transparency and openness that you have introduced , Mr Juncker
Of course , we should also highlight the successes that you have been able to achieve in a highly difficult political context
However , this debate on the Luxembourg presidency has turned into a debate on the European crisis
started to ask
What will happen to the Constitution
What does it mean if we cannot have a constitution in the end
How will this affect enlargement
Has it already started to affect enlargement
In the different regions of Europe , they have already started to ask very basic questions about the budget
What will happen
Will we get our money
What happens to all our projects
May I just say to Mr Harbour and others that we should not underestimate the citizens of Europe
Throughout Europe they know that Europe is not only about a market
the other issues that are so important for our everyday lives
can
The European Union is a unique creation
It works on the basis of this very constructive , or hopefully constructive , interaction of the ‚Äòinstitutional triangle‚Äô
However , the outcome of the European Council this weekend seems to show that one of the corners is somehow broken
work together
Mr Juncker referred to the institutional maturity that the Parliament has shown
We have seen this , for example , on the occasion of the recent Parliament resolution on the financial perspective
As President Barroso said earlier , the Commission stands ready to assist the incoming presidency to find an agreement on the future financial perspectives
We however have to bear in mind three crucial points
First , we need the resources to implement those policies on which the citizens expect the Union to deliver , and we need the budget for that
A deal that does not secure those resources will not allow us to bridge the gap between citizens and Europe
Second , this House must accept the agreement
Third , it must meet the legitimate needs of the new Member States who have shown their constructive attitude during the summit meeting
The main challenge for the months to come is the launch of a real dialogue on the future of Europe
The European Council has called for that dialogue in which the Commission is also invited to play a central role
We will of course give shape to what we call Plan D: debate , dialogue and democracy
We will work with the other institutions and we will try to mobilise the necessary resources for this
basic questions that I mentioned before
ready to respond to his very solemn invitation
Thank you , Mrs Wallstr√∂m
I hope the European Parliament and the national parliaments can play a little role in the Plan D you put forward with the Council and Commission
I have received six motions for resolution(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure
The debate is closed
The vote will be at noon tomorrow
and 1 June , was clear for all to see
the draft so-called European Constitution
if it has been ratified by all 25 Member States
a setback and to prolong the agony for some more time by giving itself a year to take stock
undergo the entire ratification process again
With regard to the Financial Perspective , the complete absence of a spirit of solidarity is regrettable
2003 on the adoption of the Statute for Members of the European Parliament (2005/2124(INI)) (A6-0189/2005)

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Members‚Äô Statute that we are discussing has to lay down the Members‚Äô prerogatives , in the first instance
a representative of the European peoples in their entirety
to govern and enhance the role and function of the Member in the European Community
A standardised approach to salaries would risk being discriminatory , because it deals with different situations in the same manner
of the mass media ‚Äì are mistaken and have not grasped the profound meaning that new rules at a European level can have
is worthwhile and fundamental for the credibility of the Union
It is for that reason that the Council and the Member States , who do not want the European Parliament to be strengthened , oppose the Statute
We came close to agreement in the last parliamentary term , when Mr Rothley , a great legal expert , and I provided significant input
and has not since approved
through its nose in a circus arena
‚Äô I repeat today the words that Mr Lehne spoke at that time
Community
In an official statement , the Council undertook to start up a process designed to provide us with common rules with regard to parliamentary immunity
It is a strong political commitment , which I welcome and which we would like to see confirmed today in this House by the Luxembourg Presidency
which we must meet
Italian Members , considered to be ill-disposed to the salary , who have made a contribution , since it gives them a drastic cut in their allowances
members of national parliaments
Recital 12 is a mirror-image of recital 11 , which in contrast allows the Member States to pay national rates
of national parliaments
those benefits that they also give to members of parliament in their own country
it does not agree with it
It has sent a letter that , in my opinion and ‚Äì I believe ‚Äì in the opinion of the majority ofMembers , is unacceptable from an institutional point of view
It is undue interference , which I have reported to you , Mr President , in order to defend our independence and our sovereignty
The Luxembourg Presidency needs to be reminded to respect the role and the prerogatives of Parliament
have acted wisely
of Parliament
Parliament is aware of the crisis of Europe , which we have discussed all afternoon , and of the need to change method
Europe has to overcome the period in which the weight of bureaucracy prevailed over the dynamics of the issues
Europe is a political issue , not a stereotype , for which clear guidelines are needed , and not a compromise at any cost
I hope that the United Kingdom intends to begin a new course of action , just as a new course of action also needs to be begun by Parliament
stated could be accepted
That is the legal basis
What if these measures did not exist
In my opinion , Mr President , they could be considered invalid by the Court of Justice
wish to stoop to similar trickery
I will conclude with an appeal , Mr President: let us approve the Statute as tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs
adapt to the new system
It is a genuine first step towards the single Statute for Members of the European Parliament

both by your Parliament and by the Council , with a view to creating such a statute
The statute we are examining today mainly took shape under the Belgian Presidency in the second half of 2001
Parliament and the Council were very close to an agreement at that time , but the stumbling block proved to be the reimbursement of actual expenses and tax liability
to have good prospects of success
In his report , Mr Rothley proposed a solution with the potential to reconcile the positions of the Council and Parliament
In particular , Parliament now favoured the reimbursement of Members‚Äô actual expenses under an arrangement that would enter into force along with the new statute
On 21 January 2004 , the Rothley report was presented to your Committee on Legal Affairs for discussion
Unfortunately , on 26 January , the General Affairs Council failed to reach political agreement , chiefly because of the budgetary implications of the draft proposals
this matter in order to secure an early agreement
there was therefore a need for informal consultations
would be made to reach agreement in the first half of 2005
in cooperation with the whole of Parliament and its President , that the negotiations on this matter would be brought to a successful conclusion
Mr President , after 26 years ‚Äì yes , 26 years ‚Äì of being directly elected by universal suffrage , the European Parliament still has no uniform statute for its Members
long last to a decision
within what was admittedly an extremely tight time frame , to present a report that should certainly satisfy the Council
It is also true that the Presidency could perhaps have devoted even more time to this matter
We thought we could resolve the issue of the financial perspectives at the same time
the Members‚Äô Statute
Presidency
You have displayed a great deal of courage and tenacity in pursuit of this statute , which has not always been an easy matter
liable to be a target for demagogues
This was brought home to me once again this afternoon right here in Parliament
statute
of actual cost and the principle that the European Parliament , and hence the Community budget , should shoulder responsibility for pension contributions
The Council cannot but be gratified to note that , thanks to our close cooperation , all of these elements have been incorporated into the final report submitted to you today
all of ours
The draft also respects a fundamental principle that underlies all European policies , namely that of non-discrimination , as well as the principle of equal pay for equal work
the report you have presented to us
of the parliamentary resolution , about which Mr Gargani has just spoken
We believe , in fact , that the substance of this recital falls largely within the domain of national laws and regulations
a par with members of the national parliament
That , however , is a national matter; it is not a matter for European legislation
European law has to ensure that there is equality within the European framework
We talk of subsidiarity; let us practise it for once
It is certainly true that this provision has been discussed among the various parties
and Parliament
These letters have spelled out clearly that such agreements or national regulations , as the case may be , are not opposed
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on this last outstanding issue , namely recital 12 , I hope that we shall be able to find a solution that satisfies the Council too
the same time for its renationalisation
This is essentially why we do not want this amendment in recital 12
will be submitted to Coreper for approval on 30 June in accordance with Article 190(5) of the EC Treaty
I hope that this procedure , so close to the finishing line , will have a satisfactory outcome
ourselves
which , after all , will have approved the statute
final push and take our decision
understand your Parliament‚Äôs concern to resolve the issue
in the near future

Mr President , I sincerely welcome the efforts of the rapporteur Mr Gargani , Parliament and the Luxembourg presidency , in finding a solution agreeable to all parties on the Members‚Äô Statute
The Commission gave its opinion on the original proposal for a statute in June 2003
It was favourable and made two general observations
an act based on Article 190 of the EC Treaty
In this new draft these provisions have been removed
Our second comment concerned the financial implications of the statute and these concerns have also been addressed
We have seemed very close to agreement before , only to have everyone‚Äôs hopes dashed at the last minute
I sincerely hope that this time the statute will finally be approved

adopting our Members‚Äô Statute
‚Äì and regarded it as more important ‚Äì to achieve success elsewhere
I would also like to thank the President of this House for his efforts in this matter , along with the Chairman of our Committee on Legal Affairs
which the President-in-Office of the Council has already mentioned
I hope I am doing what he would have wanted in recalling three fundamentals that have always underpinned our calls for a common statute
and that we should be dependent on national parliaments
mockery of the principle that all Members of this House are equal
There is some justification for the criticism that has been levelled at the internal arrangements , including the improvement in low basic rates of pay
us , having for a long time been bounced back and forth between the Council and this House , adds up to more than that
the need for long transitional periods as we move towards a standardised system
own pension contributions , but this is evidently neither the time nor the place to introduce many different and mutually contradictory individual variants
to vote in favour of it tomorrow
We also perceive a problem in Recital 12 , against which we have already voted in the Committee on Legal Affairs
down at the last hurdle by something that is a current problem , but not one with any legal significance
can make payments not only in euros , but also in the currencies of countries outside the eurozone
administrative problems for the House
We will therefore be opposing this addition , for which no provision was originally made
to make a number of additions to the resolution that we shall be adopting tomorrow
Our particular concern is with expressing our desire for an Assistants‚Äô Statute
legal position of our staff on a new footing
fair arrangements

Mr President , we are nearly there: a Members‚Äô Statute that has eluded us for so long
us this far
colleagues
This , of course , is between ourselves , but it is a small step forward for Europe
Secondly , and probably more important , between our citizens and ourselves it will finally deliver a transparent system of expenses based on actual cost
We will be cleaning up our act and removing a constant cause for public criticism
This is a bigger step for Europe and the European Parliament as it confirms its maturity
The ALDE Group will take a principled line of voting against all amendments , including recital 12
That is not because we do not think some of the amendments have merit
course we would like earlier implementation
However , what we most want is a Members‚Äô Statute and any amendment could risk destroying the delicate balance in this House and with the Council
If this fails , let it be Council‚Äôs fault , not this Parliament‚Äôs
Any amendment could potentially be a wrecking amendment in this situation
This House must show its full maturity and restraint tomorrow , vote for the essential and deliver a Members‚Äô Statute for the European Parliament

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I too would like to thank the Luxembourg Presidency and yourself for having arrived at this outcome today
a supranational parliament directly elected by the European people
value of this Statute , which has now become almost exclusively based on money
Even if we vote against paragraph 12 , I call on the Presidency to consider that it is by no means this paragraph that makes the Statute less European
It is precisely all those who interfered , particularly on the fiscal system , who have got rid of the truly European content
have very serious issues , the issue of pensions , in particular
to contribute to , and participate in , funding that reserve
That is the reason for which a number of our members will abstain on that issue and will consequently vote in favour of our amendment
On the other hand , I should like to underline the fact that we are very strongly in favour of this Statute
Even we perfectly understand that we are in a ‚Äònow or never‚Äô situation
saying just yes or no
We hope that in future we too in the European Parliament will be able to take advantage of this enlarged assent procedure

group ‚Äì very divergent ideas about what precise shape it should take
This is one reason why not all the members of my group will be voting the same way
incurred , transparency being the primary consideration
Any reimbursement over and above the actual costs is not acceptable
I might add that the possibility exists already of repaying excessive travel expenses , and that the German Members , for example , have already undertaken to do so
security systems and bear their share of funding the pension scheme , even though we are aware that this is a pension fund rather than a system founded upon solidarity
The same applies to contributions to accident insurance
salaries
We are all advocates of equal pay for equal work
uniform salary should be brought in
As for how much this should amount to , we could of course have some really good arguments about that
It also goes without saying that MEPs in receipt of a uniform salary should also be taxed on a uniform basis , namely in accordance with European tax law
so , provided that this does not result in double taxation
from the European Parliament
The principle of subsidiarity must be our guide
It is up to individual Member States to decide the salaries to be paid to their parliamentarians
The national salaries paid to Members of the European Parliament are adjusted in accordance with the actual salaries and costs that prevail in the respective Member States
Members should have their salaries paid by their own countries and pay tax there too
From the point of view purely of principle , we believe that the EU should not fix the salaries of MEPs elected by people in each of the EU countries
received by someone with a similar or more senior post in his or her own country
own country‚Äôs Head of State or Government
reasonably in keeping with the national salary situation for equivalent positions
The present system of travel expenses , which does not take account of actual costs and which is based on standard payments , is quite unfair in our view
Members should only be refunded the actual costs that arise in connection with travel
The travel expenses system can be reformed without a common Members‚Äô Statute being adopted
For the reasons given , the June List has chosen to vote against the motion
In conclusion , I would point out that , in the statutes , Members of the European Parliament are called just that ‚Äì Members or ‚Äò‚Äô
It seems odd , therefore , that , in certain countries , MEPs refer to themselves as ‚Äòhonourable‚Äô
Such expressions are antiquated in a democratic EU

me to hurriedly change the scope of my speech
I find the expression ‚Äòthe same job , the same pay‚Äô completely outrageous
I say that as a lawyer , as a legal expert: it is unthinkable that a Member can portray himself as an employee who is given a wage
its rules , which are also rules of behaviour , in addition to written , and sometimes disobeyed , rules
Among those rules , European law has to guarantee equality
Rome , Paris or any other European capital
France charges EUR 70 , EUR 80 or EUR 100
Today , we are playing a part , fully aware that we are being hypocritical at least
Articles 9 and 10 , Mr President ‚Äì is that the Members are entitled to a fair allowance , enough to give them an independent living
What constitutes fairness and independence for a Member , however
Independence with regard to what , if then , in Article 10 , the Member‚Äôs dignity is regarded as 38
5% of the basic salary of a judge in the Court of Justice
I ask that that be not mentioned; the allowance required should still be laid down , but not by linking it to that of a civil servant
The Member‚Äôs dignity stems from his direct election by the people
in another country where a person has no expenses
the content of this Statute now amounts to a package of privileges that undermines democracy
in the European Union‚Äôs coffin
privileged eating arrangements or something else
is currently in the chair and enabling this to happen
watching the European trap being set ‚Äì step by step , in a succession of misguided decisions , by one package of privileges after another
It is tragic
Nevertheless , I am still persuaded that it is possible to achieve real , serious democracy at European level , albeit not , of course , in such a manner as this
At the same time , to accuse most of this House of blindness , as happens over and over again , is to insult the blind
My grandfather was blind , and yet he was very sensitive , having a feel for , and noticing , many things
The same cannot be said of most of those in this House
I wish long life to any real , democratic parliament that is close to the people and binds peoples together
It has to be said that this is not one; it is far more a colony of the privileged
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , a few short messages can only be communicated in the space of one minute
The first message is without doubt one of thanks to the Presidency-in-Office of the Council for having in some way helped to put this debate back onto the agenda
An even more heartfelt message of thanks is offered to this Parliament
a process of European political integration , is being reached through this acknowledgment of the coherent role of being a Member of the European Parliament
This Parliament has also accepted a number of compromise assessments that I would prefer were not ignored
The principle of non-discrimination is invoked , which is sacrosanct
of the comparison with members of national parliaments
my opinion , satisfactory
The same is true for other items
I will , however , conclude my speech by making just one point , Mr President ‚Äì if you will allow me ‚Äì in a second
We are finally reaching an objective that does justice to so many false debates and so many provocations on the issue of transparency
We will realise it
We will realise it when we finally embark on a so-called system of ‚Äòpayment of expenses actually incurred‚Äô and see the effects on the parliamentary budget

Mr President , let me say very briefly that I believe this statute is a transparent work
It changes a situation which , while I do not know whether it was privilege-ridden in the way that Mr Martin has just said , was certainly unacceptable in principle
Is it normal , in fact , that one Member of Parliament should earn seven or eight hundred euros while another earns ten to twelve times that amount , if not more
Is it normal in any administration or in any service that the system for reimbursing expenses should be entirely devoid of transparency
times the actual value of the ticket
That is what people cannot understand
Consequently , if this situation is changed , that in itself , I believe , is an important step
For my own part , let me say plainly that I do not want anyone to indulge in demagogy now with this Members‚Äô Statute
It is all to the credit of your Parliament that it has adopted this statute or will adopt it tomorrow
I believe it deserves thanks for that , for the efforts of all concerned

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , one quick observation
given due importance to a significant day for Parliament , if a conclusion is reached
a compromise on recital 12 , which , Mr President , I continue to believe is important for the legal basis of the Statute itself
On my own behalf and on behalf of this Institution , I too would like to express my gratitude to the Luxembourg Presidency
This was a hot potato that everybody wanted to pass on to the next person in the hope that they would not have to hold it for too long
that does not satisfy anybody completely , but which will undoubtedly put an end , I hope , to a long-standing situation which , as the Minister has said , was not acceptable
In any event , Parliament will express its decision tomorrow through the vote; I would simply like to express the gratitude I owe personally to the Luxembourg Presidency
The vote will take place tomorrow and the honourable Members will then decide whether they accept or reject the rapporteur‚Äôs text
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
One of the Luxembourg Presidency‚Äôs successes was its achievement of agreement on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament
as making no sense whatever
not
I am aware that there are unmistakeable defects in even this compromise
One fundamental problem that remains is the rule on pensions in Article 14; what is needed is that Members pay their own share of contributions to the pension funds
than that of the Statute and will continue to press the case for a solution of this kind , which must be supplementary to the Statute
The Members‚Äô Statute also , at last , paves the way for an Assistants‚Äô Statute
The House must now make all possible haste to complete the work on one successfully
‚ÄìŒ§he next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance
Mr President , I was astonished to read in a British newspaper that several hundred Nazi war criminals are living in the United Kingdom
They include 75 Auschwitz camp guards who escaped justice
I would remind the House that the Auschwitz-Birkenau death factory was the most horrifying of all the concentration camps
I am appalled by such reports , particularly since only 700 of the 8 000 camp guards , or less than 10% , were ever put on trial
Most of these trials were conducted in Poland
their backs on the victims or take the side of the perpetrators of violence
It is an affront to the dignity of Europeans and entirely reprehensible that murderers from Auschwitz-Birkenau should meet with forbearance and leniency in one of the EU‚Äôs Member States
matter
of live cattle
distributors , and do very little to help small and medium-sized agricultural enterprises
It is up to us to do something , however , as we too can bring about certain changes in this respect
altogether
action
the suffering of animals and on the other in order to support small and medium-sized farms
‚Äì Unfortunately , there is no interpretation at the moment in the language in which you elected to speak and your speech was not therefore translated
Mr President , as an Irish speaker I welcome the decision to accord the status of official working language of the European Union to the Irish language
Irish language
the appropriate services in Irish
I wish to protest to the House about the defamation of Poles and of Poland as a whole
The latter is a country that could serve as a model of multicultural coexistence , in view of the large number of national minorities living alongside the Polish nation
In the latest report by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance , Poland is accused of virtual anti-Semitism and discrimination against Roma
The report condemns national movements and singles out , even though the latter attempts to present an objective and truthful picture of reality
Anti-Semitism has always been foreign to the Christian outlook of Poles , whereas the German Nazis and the totalitarian Soviet regime inflicted physical and moral harm upon millions of people
Ever since Poland regained independence , attempts have been made to blame Poles for this harm
Even the Jewish Diaspora in Poland objects to the report‚Äôs accusations of anti-Semitism
foreign capital
We therefore demand that the report be corrected and these insults withdrawn
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have another contribution to the previous topic
The date of 17 June 2005 will be recorded in European history as a failure
summit , hoping for a positive conclusion
It did not happen
One-fifth of the EU25 selfishly broke away , and the enlarged Europe received yet another slap in the face
an agreement
the enlargement parts of the Union
And the word ‚Äòcitizen‚Äô has again merely remained on the lips of us , the politicians
Let us not forget , however , that the Chinese train is crashing into Europe with astronomical speed
We have slowed down the European one , or even diverted it at no less than three points on the track
Unless we breathe new life into the Union as soon as possible , we shall have to rename the unfulfilled Lisbon strategy as the ‚ÄòEuropean tragedy‚Äô
and road network density
This situation is made worse by the addition of the A74 motorway to the existing A73
The A74 will attract many extra lorries , which are major polluters
The government‚Äôs decision to map out the A74 in this area demonstrates that it is not taking the Dutch and European environmental standards seriously
The volume of fine dust will increase dramatically
How can we possibly carry on along these lines
We recently concluded that at this rate , Europe will no longer meet even the Kyoto standards
This planned A74 is a motorway to hell
If we want to make it to Kyoto , we will have to make a U-turn
2004/0127(COD)) (A6-0188/2005)
Mr President , a fortnight or three weeks ago , we celebrated 20 years of the Schengen agreements
These agreements opened up a new dimension of Europe and put it in a new perspective
20 years after the conclusion of the Schengen agreements
We have achieved an objective in this domain , an objective set for us by the Thessaloniki European Council on 19 and 20 June 2004
the ground at the external or internal borders of the Union
of the Union but also , as I said , with a component on the internal borders , since these two aspects are undeniably complementary
borders
in the event of a threat to public safety or to the internal security of a Member State
This regulation adapts these provisions to the institutional framework of the Community
been more or less reproduced
The practicalities for the conduct of these checks are laid down in the annexes and are mostly subject , like the core provisions of the regulation , to the codecision procedure
Work began on the Community Code on 2 July 2004 under the Dutch Presidency and has been vigorously pursued throughout the period of the Luxembourg Presidency
Justice and Home Affairs unanimously adopted the compromise amendments
The Community Code is the first instrument in the field of asylum , immigration , visas and borders to be subject to codecision with Parliament
the Council and , on the other hand , a precedent that can only enhance the efficiency of future work on dossiers examined under the codecision procedure
it takes place in a more strongly democratic context
of mutual trust
This collaboration has served to establish compromises which all three institutions can now endorse
of non-EU countries
I believe there has been much talk of crisis today , of a European Union in crisis
the European Union is capable of taking decisions , of making progress in the interests of the people and above all , as I indicated before , of progressing democratically with parliamentary support
application of the Treaty of Amsterdam
seen the light of day
I therefore believe that this is a good evening for Europe
We are poised to adopt an important instrument
On behalf of the Presidency , I thank Parliament and the Commission for their collaboration

truly important application here today on a subject that affects people‚Äôs everyday lives
The rapporteur has without doubt carried out some extraordinary work , and the same must be said of the Presidency
vote in Parliament at first reading
principle of free movement of persons within the Union and the equally crucial requirement for effective controls at the external borders of the European Union
The other significant merit is that of having adapted a number of procedures originating in a purely intergovernmental domain to the context of the European Union
We have taken a step forward
false move would have been genuinely counterproductive
There then follows a positive item for the Commission: the involvement and active participation of the Commission in the process of reintroducing the controls
for this ‚Äì constructive contribution to ensuring the optimum application of that regulation
I will conclude by saying , Mr President , that those signs are the signs that the European citizens are waiting for
They are signs of faith in a Europe , in a European Union , which is alive , which can continue to make progress and to obtain tangible results
out

presidency , let alone under the Luxembourg presidency
The importance of this has been underlined by the previous speakers
It is the first time that the Parliament has acted in codecision in the area of asylum , immigration and border control
It is extremely important that the Parliament dealt with this dossier in a mature , reasonable and practicable way
Wish lists are for the past
Of course we have not achieved everything that we in Parliament wanted; as we know that is the nature of compromise
That is not to say that compromise is a bad word , it is a brilliant word
Compromise is the whole notion on which the European project was built in the early 1950s and in 1957
I am proud that today we are legislating
In this House , and indeed in our other institutions , we talk too much and do not deliver enough
Tonight we are legislating and bringing forward changes that will have a real effect on real lives
As was mentioned earlier , each of us , especially as politicians , can talk a defining moment into a crisis
But what do we achieve in doing this
We actually reinforce the argument from eurosceptics and the europhobes that this House means nothing and achieves nothing
We have difficulties , but out of difficulties comes a rebirth , a renaissance
Without a renaissance there is nothing for the future
involved in the negotiations
Why have we have achieved so much
Because we have done it on the basis that only by acting together can we achieve more than we could ever achieve by acting alone
I have to thank my fellow rapporteurs
There have been no shadows in this report; we have been equal rapporteurs , equal participants and without them we could not have presented this document today
I would like to thank Mr Battilocchio for the opinion he gave on behalf of the Committee on Development
this work
Those people are so rarely thanked
So let me say once again , we have achieved a great deal
We have reinforced the role of the Parliament , especially in the re-introduction of internal borders
which was not possible
I wanted us to have a right of appeal or for the European Court of Justice to have jurisdiction
We did not achieve this , but we achieved a great deal more
dignity and , if necessary , in a non-public area
origin
And where appeals are successful , the necessary compensation will be provided according to national law and corrections
the single biggest benefit of being in the European Union
As an inclusion to the main body of text , the annexes are extremely important when we come to adopt and review this regulation in future
Regular reports on the implementation of the regulation are to be compiled by the Commission
Member State from the visa obligation‚Äô
I am proud of what we have done , I am proud of the collaboration and I now wait to hear from my co-rapporteurs

work he has carried out and on his excellent proposal
on Development
can follow the codecision process in this domain
that of embarking for the first time upon a policy on immigration shared by all of the Member States
On this issue , the European Parliament has over and again established the need to balance the interests of the European citizens , immigrants , the Member States and developing countries
and safeguarded , and a policy of openness towards those who lawfully venture within our borders in search of improved living conditions
It should in fact be remembered that , as the European Union , we also have humanitarian duties
adopting a global approach of solidarity and respect for human rights , particularly in humanitarian crisis situations , such as in the recent cases of the tsunami and of Darfur
with a view to preventing the unpleasant , and , alas , frequent episodes of discrimination , which to date still occur
pairing
It will not be easy , but it is a challenge that today‚Äôs Europe has to accept and overcome

Mr President , my speech this evening is rather incidental , because it relates to the study of the legal basis for the proposed Regulation
and 70
Member States should establish the conditions and exceptions in the field
of no longer than three months
That was the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs
necessary to change the legal basis
reference to paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 62 be necessary , but also the reference to paragraph 3

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal that we are discussing intends to establish a Community code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders
It falls within the context of the Treaty of Amsterdam , thanks to which the Schengen has been incorporated within the European framework
consultation process to the codecision process as a result of the decision made by the Council of the Hague
to further develop the subject , particularly with regard to the crossing of internal borders
the final provisions
A large proportion of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur aim at clarifying a number of the elements of the Commission proposal only in terms of the language used
Such changes are designed to improve the quality of the text , and , simultaneously , to clarify and simplify the articles
guards and the authorities
The rapporteur has worked commendably , in close cooperation with all of the shadow rapporteurs and political groups , in addition to checking first-hand how the borders are crossed today
Thanks to this ongoing dialogue , the rapporteur has fulfilled all of the requests submitted to him
the current presidency
the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs
very positive outlook on each individual amendment tabled
at the present time , and it is therefore desirable that it is adopted in full
rapporteur , whom I wholeheartedly thank for the valuable work he has carried out

Mr President , Commissioner Frattini , I wish to begin by thanking Mr Cashman and others for a very constructive report
Community Code and the movement of persons across borders
The fact that we can now revise controls and jointly strengthen the external borders means that the EU‚Äôs borders become more secure
their foreign appearance , can now feel welcome
When , tomorrow , we vote in favour of the report , we shall be able to get to grips with one of the committees‚Äô major tasks: asylum and immigration policy
We have so many shared questions about how we in the EU are to safeguard the values referred to
groups
That is the first step
Thank you again for a very constructive report

advisedly ‚Äì that has paved the way for the agreement presented to us today on the basis , I must add , of an excellent proposal from the Commission
My thanks go to those who are seated behind Mr Frattini today
I wish to thank Mr Cashman , who , in the face of widespread scepticism , in which I initially shared , sought to reach agreement with the Council at first reading
Congratulations , Michael
But I also wish to extend my congratulations to the Luxembourg Presidency for showing the necessary drive and tenacity to stay on course while encouraging the essential compromises
It is indeed a marvellous Little Big Land , this Grand Duchy of Luxembourg
For my part , I had three particular concerns about this dossier
checks required for the identification at external borders of persons registered for refusal of admission and wanted persons
is an improvement on my proposal , and I am delighted with that
rights ought to be clearly defined and made known to the parties concerned , but at the same time security requirements had to be rigorous
The people of Europe do not want their external borders to be controlled by thugs , but neither do they want to have them controlled by blinded and limbless eunuchs
the confirmation of the exceptional nature of the reintroduction of checks at external borders and by the more prominent role assigned to the Commission and Parliament
In view of these three grounds for satisfaction , it will give me pleasure to vote in favour of this report , and the entire Group will do likewise

groups and , of course , to the Luxembourg presidency for the work we have done together
The various groups within this House have amply demonstrated their ability to cooperate jointly and effectively , both among themselves and with the Council
Let me give an example of the sort of case that could occur , the sort of case with which we were faced when we began work on this dossier
the required documents at a border crossing point
This would have resulted in a stamp being placed in his passport showing that he had been refused entry to the EU
his passport
The point I should particularly like to emphasise is therefore that we have succeeded in enshrining the right to appeal in the regulation , following lengthy negotiations
good reason
We have also achieved other , equally significant improvements for third‚Äìcountry nationals
Human dignity must be respected during border controls , and discrimination on any grounds is prohibited
In a nutshell , our joint efforts have resulted in a solution which means that checks on those crossing the EU‚Äôs external borders will become a great deal more welcoming
and all the benefits of Schengen free movement and respecting the dignity of people , particularly from third countries , who want to enter the Union
Doing all of that within a codecision procedure is a great achievement and we have learned a lot from the way that cooperation has taken place
is very difficult
an explicit reference to anti-discrimination and to the dignity of people while carrying out border checks
There is a huge hidden minority of people that are harassed and victimised at borders
Mr Cashman has understood this , he has put it explicitly in his report and he has created the balance that we all wanted to see
‚Äì The debate is closed
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon
‚Äì The next item is the debate on the report by Bogdan Klich , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , on Security Research (2004/2171(INI)) (A6-0103/2005)

Mr President , it has been a pleasure to draft this report for two reasons
Union for Europe of the Nations Group
The second reason is that the Commission has made an extremely valuable contribution on points of substance
mass destruction and the spread of international terrorism
terrorism that affects many more people and is far more deadly and dangerous
What this means is that the objectives of maintaining public security and making our security and defence policy credible are hard to achieve nowadays without high-tech tools
The European Union currently invests four times less in the defence sector and five times less in research and development than the United States
of defence potential and security
umbrella of the Seventh Framework Programme
The European Security Research Programme will be based on a coherent , flexible and coordinated approach , and will focus on research projects that enhance our technological capabilities
The approach currently taken to security research at the highest EU level lacks coherence
This leads to extensive fragmentation and weak cooperation between Member States , and also makes such research less cost-effective
The establishment of a European Security Research Programme will therefore facilitate both interoperability and cost optimisation by putting in place common frameworks and structures at European level
The Programme provides for the exploitation of synergies between defence and civil research , so it can be expected to boost the integration of these two sectors
by the individual Member States , should serve to narrow the gap that currently exists between the EU Member States and the United States
Strengthening our research base and finding more innovative solutions is bound to enhance Europe‚Äôs competitiveness
It is anticipated that this Programme will be an excellent opportunity for European industry , and also for our research centres
I have in mind all such centres , academic , non-academic , civil and defence ones
The Programme will undoubtedly improve external border protection and make it possible to modernise the armed forces of the EU Member States
The report refers to several priority areas of interest , of which I shall only mention a few
and IT technology
The report also encourages the Commission to support research in the field of social sciences , without which appropriate planning of research into modern technologies is inconceivable
namely that any discussion of advanced technological research must first focus on support for such research
achieve the EU‚Äôs objectives
Mr President , I would therefore strongly recommend that the House vote in favour of this report

for the recommendations and suggestions you have made to the Commission
Security is an essential component of a number of different EU policy areas , including the common foreign and security policy and the area of freedom , security and justice
At the same time , however , security is also a basic requirement for prosperity and growth and , as such , indispensable for achieving the economic policy goals of the Lisbon Agenda
We need the best tools available if we are to be able to meet challenges to public safety , and we also need a strong knowledge and technology base
to the Commission one year ago; ‚Äòtechnology alone cannot guarantee security , but security without technology is impossible‚Äô
Security managers , industry and the public are among those who benefit from security research , and , in order to meet their high expectations , consistency must be achieved between its various facets
will ensure that it acts as a driving force for growth and employment in Europe
products
A further aim of the Programme will be to focus on civil security matters
order to address the dual-use aspects of security technologies
with third parties ‚Äì including those outside the EU ‚Äì and the level of Community contributions
Security research is one half of the two-fold thematic priority ‚ÄòSecurity and Space‚Äô , which falls within the specific programme ‚ÄòCooperation‚Äô under the Seventh Research Programme
Current proposals provide for an annual budget of around EUR 500 million
The Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament‚Äôs report calls for an annual budget of EUR 1 billion , as proposed by the Group of Personalities
of crisis
These four topics will be supported by a number of horizontal areas , namely systems integration and interoperability , security and society and coordinating and structuring research
discuss the structure of the Research Programme
as observers on the European Security Research Advisory Board
Parliament has always backed the current Preparatory Action for Security Research , and this backing has been much appreciated
Committee on Industry , Research and Energy
to funding for the Preparatory Actions
under the umbrella of the Seventh Research Framework Programme
Security research will focus on activities that provide a distinct European added value compared to national measures
society as a whole to feel and be safer
I should like to thank the rapporteur once again for his work

Mr President , as representative of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , I would firstly like to thank and congratulate Mr Klich on his wonderful report
field to be subject to considerable fluctuations in available budget
Finally , Mr President , I believe that we will have a European programme for security research within the seventh framework programme and a plural , technical and political advisory committee
only be corrected by means of the correct application of European research policies , without any links to or dependency on third parties
It is essential to increase the efficiency of progress with the sensor system , biotechnology , space and communication technologies
I would therefore like once again , Mr President , to congratulate Mr Klich on having dealt with this report of such essential importance

We live in a time that demands rapid response to global changes and security threats
a higher degree of security for European citizens
The dangers and threats demand that the problem is dealt with on a European level
And security research , as set out , represents a tool for increasing European competitiveness and achieving the Lisbon objectives
Indeed it represents an area that signifies major research , innovation and technological potential for the European Union
agreement on the financial perspective
are now still included in the seventh framework programme
These new programmes include security research
It must be stated clearly that without adequate financial support , we cannot expect good results
and in decision-making on the European level
the Lisbon strategy , and thereby security research
This is indeed important for each individual Member State , and in view of the numerous synergy effects , also for the European integration processes

‚Äì Mr President , the proposal by the European Commission to create a European Security Research Programme is an initiative which moves in the right direction
dangers and challenges by reinforcing European defence and security policy and the common foreign policy and defence and security policy
However , the problem is not only institutional and political
It is , at the same time , operational
It is a question of the effective application of the decisions taken at the level of the European institutions
Consequently , it is also linked to the ability of the European Union to proceed more quickly in the sectors of research , technology and innovation for European security
Our objective must not be blind competition with the United States
defence equipment , the European Union and the Member States are , unfortunately , much worse off
security and protection of European citizens
implementation of the Lisbon Strategy
EUR one billion
The European Security Research Programme must not be one-sidedly orientated towards technology research
Balanced development of research is needed which will also cover the fields of political , social and human sciences
militaristic or police-state philosophy
One of the main goals of the Programme is the protection of outside borders and basic infrastructures
These are important goals which relate to the security of the European Union , because they strengthen the visibility of the Programme to European citizens
political and democratic freedoms
Finally , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Klich , and to say that our group will be voting in favour of his report tomorrow

‚Äì Mr President , it has almost become routine in this Chamber for us to have a legislative framework against terrorism in every plenary session
Every measure we take against terrorism , which we cannot be sure will be effective against it , is by definition harmful to democracy and human rights
promotes democracy
Despite its pretty words , this report also moves in the same direction
Terrorism started to show its teeth thirty years ago
Then we said that the Stasi , the KGB and Gaddafi were behind it
Remember the aeroplane hijacks
Now there is no Stasi , there is no Gaddafi , there is no KGB
How does terrorism develop
Who feeds it
Another issue which it raises is why terrorists hit certain specific countries
Perhaps they hit the big countries
Then why do they not hit China , Brazil or Canada
Why did the last generation of terrorists choose to pick on Spain out of all the European countries
My country organised Olympic Games , squandered billions of euros of taxpayers' money and yet the terrorists did not hit us , which they could very well have done
We need therefore to learn a lesson: violence begets violence
In order to stop terrorism , we invaded two countries: Afghanistan and Iran
60 a barrel
We have new reports against terrorism and yet no report puts Mr Bush , who brought us to this point , in his place
Mr Blair , Mr Bush's field marshal , will be here tomorrow
with the result that people are unable to pay and we are in this difficult position
Yes , money against terrorism but , above all of course , a policy for the people of Europe
‚Äì The debate is closed
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon

‚Äì Œ§he next item is the debate on the report by Catherine Trautmann , on behalf of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , on the information society (2004/2204(INI)) (A6-0172/2005)

Mr President , my report deals with the World Summit on the Information Society , a process initiated by the United Nations
The first phase took place in Geneva in 2003 and concluded with the adoption of a declaration of principles and a plan of action
action and governance of the Internet
The European Union has engaged in this process with a coordinated position and considerable authority , because it can speak with one voice
If my fellow Members adopt this resolution , our Parliament will underpin the position of the Union and signal its commitment to the success of the process
Information and communication technology , ICT , plays an integral part in the pursuit of the Millennium Goals , which are all about the elimination of poverty
The war on poverty focuses on material necessities but it also involves access to online services , whether these be educational , health-related , administrative or commercial
The rise of the Internet and of mobile telephony has created new potential for development , competitiveness and growth
Europe suffers from four dimensions of the digital divide: geographical , social , economic and cultural
This divide is even deeper in the least-developed countries , or LDCs , which have neither an adequate infrastructure nor the means to provide mass access to these forms of technology
The first issue to emphasise is the contribution of ICT to democracy
decision-making processes
It is imperative that these human rights be respected in the information society
the security and integrity of individuals , organisations and even governments , cannot justify failure to respect these rights
Cultural and linguistic diversity should be one of the driving forces of the progress initiated by the World Summit
Such diversity is easier to achieve in a democratic context , and our Parliament has a duty to point this out to Tunisia , which will be hosting the summit
The second issue is the need for a new form of partnership with the countries of the South
These countries require confidence and the prospect of long-term stability before they can act
Cancelling the debt of the poorest countries is a good thing as long as it does not reduce their access to funding
Merely substituting donations for access to lending facilities would be ineffective
of the existing funds allocated to our own development programmes , to the framework programme for research and development and to the Competitiveness and Innovation programme
In the same vein , I have suggested that unused development appropriations be allocated to the plan of action
The creation of the Digital Solidarity Fund on a voluntary basis is to be welcomed , but the Fund remains a complementary instrument
The Union should give preference to multipartite initiatives involving national governments , the private sector , local and/or regional authorities and NGOs
production of content with due respect for local cultures and local know-how
Multipartite ventures are an indicator of confidence and mobilisation
Before our representatives leave for Tunis , incidentally , our Parliament will meet interested parties from civil society in order to establish a durable working relationship
In conclusion , let me say that the key aim is the promotion of fair and sustainable development
This is the essence of our vision of an inclusive information society
the European Union to be considered in terms of shared development and shared responsibility
Our partners , like ourselves , should be assured of a voice in the system of governance and of the preservation of their sovereign decision-making powers
Whether in the field of health care , prevention , environmental risks , waste management or conservation of resources , we are interdependent
European growth is inconceivable without solidarity

initiative
your regular debates on the information society
The Commission attaches a great deal of importance to the summit and is also devoting considerable efforts to it in close liaison with the Member States
the technological dimension to encompass the impact of the relevant technology on society and social welfare
has been done on its behalf
technology in improving essential public services , in increasing popular participation in decision-making processes and , ultimately , in developing participatory democracy
The same applies to the subjects on the agenda , such as governance of the Internet , financing , partnerships and the follow-up to the summit
In addition , your report rightly stresses the significance of a consistent approach on the part of the Community
It also underlines the importance of participation by civil society and mobilisation of the private sector
For the future , it supports the Commission‚Äôs proposals in general and proposes a follow-up focusing on targeted initiatives in the various areas of Community competence
the summit , a position that the Council should set out in the form of conclusions in Luxembourg this coming Monday
information and communication technology within the existing mechanisms and which incorporates the Digital Solidarity Fund created in Geneva
which must be compatible with the responsibility of governments to their citizens
role of all parties involved in this governance
As far as the follow-up to the summit is concerned , our wish is for a simple , effective , decentralised solution that makes use of existing organisations and their coordination mechanisms
Lastly , I should like to say to the rapporteur and her collaborators that I share their concern about the human-rights situation in Tunisia
The situation is far from satisfactory in many areas , particularly as regards freedom of expression and association
approved at preceding summits
all possible , attend the hearing she is organising to consult the European NGOs prior to the summit
In conclusion , I wish to congratulate your Assembly on this report and to assure you that the Commission will heed your recommendations and follow them up
Let me also express my conviction that the message you are delivering will strengthen the position of the European Union in the global arena

Mr President , I would firstly like to welcome the report on the information society by Mrs Trautmann and congratulate her on the excellent work she has done
of view and also from technological , social and cultural points of view
laid down in the Lisbon Strategy
and multilingualism
Ladies and gentlemen , in this respect , our reflection is complete
It is now time to turn these priorities into real actions , and in order to do so we also need a good budget
It is pointless to carry on working and talking about priorities unless we have a budget to back them up
society is a key factor which must also be considered , given its significant impact on economic growth , employment and social cohesion
objectives of the Lisbon Strategy in a Europe of 25 with a budget of just 1% of Community revenue
it has not already

the information society
After Geneva , we have now reached a second phase
We therefore greatly appreciate Mrs Trautmann‚Äôs own-initiative report and also her way of going about things
the presentation of the report
The title of the report ‚ÄòOn the information society‚Äô is very ambitious and broad indeed , but what is it about
It is about Parliament expressing an opinion and making its contribution to the conference of 16 to 18 November 2005
That is why we suggested she should choose less ambitious and more direct wording along the lines of ‚ÄòThe world summit on the information society , second phase‚Äô
This would also be more in keeping with Mrs Reding‚Äôs communication
As I said , our group greatly appreciates this discussion and active participation
Access to the Internet , special attention to ICT and education all over the world , on-line government and truly participatory democracy are crucial
High-level ICT is not only central to our Lisbon agenda but also , and specifically , to its implications for the developing countries
A combination of education and development of networks and corresponding services is of major importance for developing countries
We would do well to consider what support the EU can offer in this context
I would now like to turn to the instruments that we discussed
The PPE-DE Group advocates a framework of independent regulatory authorities guaranteeing access , freedom of expression and information , cultural diversity and multilingualism
We are therefore opposed to even more rules and regulations , and we support the existing current basis for on-line government
Having also debated the free and public search programmes , we will not be backing the amendments that have been tabled concerning them
Last week , as we just heard , Mrs Reding unfolded her plans for 2010
She places ICT in the context of the development of economic growth and job creation , and this something that we welcome
This is where economic growth and a social model fit together very well
order to narrow the gap between the haves and have-nots
This is what ties in with EU policy , for the gap is still enormous
basis is urgently needed
It can hardly be said that the past weeks have increased confidence in this area
That will be the subject of a follow-up debate

Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Trautmann for her excellent report which , to a large extent , has incorporated our concerns by means of amendments
At the same time , I would like to express our profound concern about the human rights situation in the host country , which we believe to be very critical
I would like the Commission to take action in this regard in order to ensure the participation of civil society in the coming Summit
to information , above all in the countries of the South
We find it unacceptable that , in the countries of the South , a few large multinational companies create a dependency in the field of the Internet from the outset
in Mrs Trautmann's excellent report

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I thank Mrs Trautmann for her excellent report , which addresses , , the topic of eliminating the digital divide
It is an issue of balanced development , but above all of social equality
With this in mind , information technology is a fundamental element for constructing a more culturally-rich and more unified society
involved parties and not only consumers
public administration
There is , moreover , the issue of governance , which Europe has to address in order to establish a control mechanism at international level
The mandate of the ICANN is about to expire
civil society , each with its own role and clear obligations
In drafting the proposal , the fact that knowledge , as an instrument of development and of freedom , is a common asset should be reaffirmed
Worrying signs are , however , emerging from the Council , which are at odds with this
all and thus undermining the very foundations of the Lisbon Strategy

Mr President , thank you for giving me this opportunity
The Commissioner and rapporteur have done some excellent work
The new information and communication technologies can help promote European democracy , skills and expertise , and competitiveness
The Union‚Äôs legislation must , however , ensure that this is actually the case
New communications media , such as the mobile television , will open up new opportunities for small producers
Mobile communications are not affected by restrictions such as prime time viewing or viewing times that are too short
In other words , everyone can in principle watch television when they like
I would propose that the Commission should set up a programme to support small European producers of these new media; for example , the mobile television
That way we would bring about an increase in much needed , distinctive and versatile software
A multicultural Europe is just the right basis for that , and , consequently , as Europeans , we would find our place in these new communication technologies
As legislators , we have a democratic and cultural duty to prevent centralisation of the sector
That is a problem we all have in common
major challenge , because diversified communication is absolutely essential for us to develop a knowledge-based economy
The Commission should therefore take a close look at the viability of markets and access to a diverse culture and information in different countries , different media and different content
Mr President , Commissioner Reding , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Paasilinna , today we are discussing the future not only of Europe , but also of the international information society
Strategy , the main objectives of which are growth and employment
Our task must be to show people that what growth really means is how much they have in the bank at the end of each month
whether in the case of pensions , students or universities
and software , but above all in terms of training
The focus of our efforts must be on promoting the role of Internet-based professional training
and so it opens up a wide range of possibilities for achieving what must be our main goal , namely encouraging growth and employment throughout the world
Health is another factor that must not be neglected , as it will be a key determinant of future welfare spending
the case of diseases of old age
It is for this reason that research , development and trade are of absolutely vital importance , as are family businesses and small and medium-sized enterprises
I would ask the Commissioner to ensure that such issues take centre stage in Tunis
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her good work , which I support entirely
social development , and also for cooperation
The European Union‚Äôs leadership with regard to cooperation with developing countries undoubtedly offers those countries an opportunity to open up to the information society to the benefit of everybody
Two issues concern me , however
The first is the funding of the action plan
The World Digital Solidarity Fund is clearly insufficient , given its voluntary nature , and we must therefore mobilise more financial resources , whether they be development , structural or other new resources
the information society
next Presidency of the Council , attached to promoting greater establishment and development of information and communication technologies
with the participation of all the States
development of the Internet; only in that way will our true support for the information society be credible
the report , which I otherwise support and believe to be good
This negative thing is a phenomenon that can be described using the increasingly familiar expression ‚Äòe-apathy‚Äô
consumers in the information society
This really is our only possible goal , but we must see the obstacles too
E-apathy is one of these obstacles
In Hungary today , for example , only one in every four adults uses the Internet regularly
Meanwhile , the vast majority of non-users insist that they do not need it , or are simply not interested
This example is not unique
The ratio is similar in the majority of the new Member States
To a significant share of the population the advantages and opportunities provided by the Internet appear ambivalent
passive or dismissive towards the implementation of costly systems
All of this of course could also bring about asymmetry in the relationship between the old and new Member States
It is in our common interest to avoid this and strengthen cohesion in this area too
We must therefore do everything we can to reinforce -inclusion by ensuring more vigorous , clearer and more intelligible communication than hitherto
And we must also give priority to dispelling engrained negative attitudes and misconceptions surrounding the new medium , alongside emphasising its positive attributes
for her work
Nowadays , information and communication technologies most certainly rank among the main contributing factors to economic growth and sustainable development
users or citizens are insufficiently aware of the advantages , or are not capable of using our modern acquisitions
in the earliest stages of school education
On the other hand , society should not exclude older people who are still afraid to use modern communication and modern media
Many cases are known where citizens have preferred to retire or become unemployed rather than adapt to using computers
At today‚Äôs rapid pace we have trouble keeping up with what is new , and this will be repeated from generation to generation
There exists , therefore , the danger of elite groups emerging , owing to exclusion from the information society
knowledge and experience in this area
For this reason , in addition to development , society must ensure the possibility of education for all strata of the population and for all age groups
will diminish
Institutions offering these services must advise consumers of the possibility of dangers , while at the same time giving them guarantees against misuse
part of Europe
We must now go one step further
regional levels
While building this information society , we must focus not only on the obvious tasks of promoting and constructing basic infrastructure , but also and above all , on education
people to take a critical and creative approach to all forms of media
The information society entails free and unrestricted access to technology and information , and this is why I believe that software patents would mean certain death for such a society
Grim dictatorships , motivated by the fear of certain ideas , still find ways of blocking access to information
There is nothing new in this
A law has been adopted in Cuba restricting Internet access to selected businesses and government offices , and banning the sale of computers to the public
Only 6 000 of the 100 000 computers in Cuba are connected to international networks , and even these are kept under close control
its growing popularity
A new law has been drafted on the mass media
, this law provides for mandatory registration and makes it necessary for Internet-based publishers to obtain what is known as a publishing licence
In reality , the latter will act as a powerful instrument of censorship
with access to external telecommunications services
is USD 60
There is no escaping the conclusion that this issue must also be a focus of our activities
to speak
Unusually , everything has run very early tonight
Society in December 2003 with her distinguished predecessor , Erkki Liikanen
I was privileged to be there in the great chamber in Geneva when he made a very eloquent speech on behalf of the European Union
work of the information society
It has given a clear lead to other member states as well
I am sure that Commissioner Reding will want to continue that important tradition , because there is much work to be done
I want to underline two points that were emphasised to me during that time in Geneva
The first is the importance of our research programme and spreading that research programme out to the less-developed world
There are many computer scientists struggling with totally inadequate facilities who would really like to be on our research networks and working with our research scientists
I know that part of the next generation of the ‚ÄòGeant‚Äô programme , which the Commissioner launched last week , will address that issue
it is in health , education or other forms of local service provision , particularly over a very widespread area and one where communications are very light
as us to plentiful , cheap services
If we can achieve those two things , along with the other things , it will be a tremendous advance for all those countries
‚Äì The debate is closed
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon
affair (O-0068/2005 ‚Äì B6-0245/2005)

sudden departure for Poland
Everything which is said only reflects the position of the Committee on Petitions and not that of any political group or of me personally
The Chairman , Mr Libicki , asks the House and the committee to excuse his absence
of a Europe of the citizens or , more specifically , of European nationality
The right to petition , as enshrined in the Treaty , implies obligations for all the European institutions , not just Parliament
is infringement in matters which touch on the competences of the European Union , there will be reparation
The debate on the petitions relating to the Lloyd's affair seeks an honest reply from the Commission , as the guardian of the Treaties
us think about how Europe operates
Citizens have the right to expect that , when the Council and Parliament adopt legislation , it is applied correctly in the Member States of the European Union without exception
It has come to our attention that the petitioners in 1997 in the United Kingdom have stated that the Community Non-Life Insurance Directive was late being introduced
On this subject , after a long interval , Parliament took exceptional measures , approving the report by Mr Roy Perry in September 2003 by 358 for , no votes against and 35 abstentions
the Perry resolution , so that they can finally proceed with their case before the courts in Great Britain and seek compensation for the losses which they have sustained
failed to render proper account to the European Parliament , then I believe that we should do so without fear , Mr Libicki says
more and more of whom are filing petitions
Is our usual legislation good enough and is it correctly applied
Is there free movement of goods and persons and recognition of professional qualifications
Do European citizens have rights
That is the substance of this evening's debate
regulation and control of the insurance market over the last two decades and if solvency requirements existed at that time
Reply please , Commissioner; not you personally , of course
Remember that your predecessor only went into action when he came under pressure , instituting infringement proceedings which were later withdrawn when the United Kingdom complied
Reply , on behalf of your institution , before Parliament; reply above all on the question of compliance by the country in question over this specific period

Mr President , the question of the regulation of Lloyd‚Äôs and the application of the First Non-Life Insurance Directive in the United Kingdom has been debated before in this Chamber
I refer to Oral Question B5-0010/2004 by Mr Perry , which was debated by Parliament on 12 February 2004 , and to the answer given by the Commission on that occasion
The Commission has always expressed the greatest sympathy for the thousands of individuals ‚Äì including the petitioners ‚Äì who have suffered as a result of the Lloyd‚Äôs affair
document
The UK authorities informed the Commission that new legislation had been enacted to replace the former regime and answered further Commission questions relating to that new legislation
The Commission then announced that it was satisfied that those aspects of the regulatory and supervisory regime for Lloyd‚Äôs under examination were compatible with the requirements of the directive
with the letter of formal notice in December 2001 in relation to the old regime
The Court of Justice‚Äôs jurisprudence on the purpose and conduct of infringement proceedings is quite clear
The Commission has always stressed to complainants that any action seeking damages for alleged incompatibility under the former regime must be undertaken exclusively before the United Kingdom courts
compatibility or incompatibility of the former Lloyd‚Äôs regime
However , only the Court of Justice can give such rulings
ultimately , if it had been continued , have led to a formal hearing and ruling at the Court of Justice
matter of infringement proceedings
I have taken note of the motion for a resolution tabled for the purpose of winding up tonight‚Äôs debate on this question
The Commission believes that the points addressed to it in Mr Perry‚Äôs report , to which the draft resolution makes reference , have all been answered
The Commission made its views on the UK authorities‚Äô responses to the letter of formal notice public when it decided to close the infringement procedure
As to the access to documents retained by the Commission , I stress that these are governed by Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001
The conditions for gaining access to these documents are set out in that regulation
letters of formal notice
I stress , however , that these were only questions
Such questions do not , in themselves , constitute an opinion or judgement
The answers provided by the UK authorities satisfied the Commission and led it to decide that there were no grounds to pursue the infringement procedure

financial interest in any way , shape or form
My family has been associated with Lloyd‚Äôs for over 200 years in one form or another and I therefore understand the marketplace and how Lloyd‚Äôs functions
I have no specific animus against Lloyd‚Äôs in any way , shape or form
Indeed , arguably , I strongly support the organisation
in terms of the substance
This is about the fact that the question tabled by Roy Perry and now by the Committee on Petitions has not been answered properly
this question has not been responded to properly
action against the Commission to answer that question , if ‚Äì as I suspect is already the case this evening ‚Äì this has not happened
individual Member
The issue itself continues , as the Commissioner and Members know
People are still being made bankrupt and their health and their lives are still often in turmoil
This petition needs to be closed , we need answers to the question
previously by my former colleague Roy Perry
be able to pursue their cases
I have never been and will not be one who advises members of Lloyd‚Äôs ‚Äì ‚ÄòNames‚Äô ‚Äì who have suffered financially to pursue a case with no expectation of success
That way lies folly and further trouble
However , I , along with colleagues who have investigated this matter , believe that it needs proper consideration
That is why the question has been tabled in the terms it has
This is no personal reflection on Commissioner McCreevy , but I am not satisfied that the Commission has given the proper answer
Therefore , it must realise that further consequences will follow

but , according to Article 232 , in order for the European Parliament to complain about a violation of the Treaty , it must involve a violation of the Treaty as such
has failed to fulfil an obligation under this Treaty , it shall deliver a reasoned opinion on the matter after giving the State concerned the opportunity
‚Äô
Since the State conformed to the Commission‚Äôs opinion , we currently have no case from a legal point of view
legal authorities , but not before the Institutions of the European Union
for dealing with this kind of complaint
That , unfortunately , is how the Treaty is worded
Court of Justice is clear and that is why I raised objections in relation to this issue and I continue to do so today
Law
to an end; from that point , the Commission can do nothing
My feeling is that , at this point , both the Commission‚Äôs previous reply and the reply that Commissioner McCreevy has just given us are entirely satisfactory
it would also mislead the people affected , because it takes them along a path that will take them nowhere
The British courts themselves are their only chance of success; in fact I believe actions have already been brought before those courts
This is the only form of action possible
And that is what I recommend to the people involved in this kind of complaint

that , as we have seen , dates back to the 1970s
loss
of Parliament and Europe‚Äôs institutions
The central issue here is about how the European Union functions and , more particularly within your area , about how the internal market functions
It is quite simple really: a directive appears not to have been fully and properly implemented over a long period of years
Eventually the Member State comes into compliance 20 years after the event
That just cannot be good enough for Parliament or for Europe
In addition , our Committee on Petitions is often the first point of call
It should be an early warning system , but sometimes , as in this case , it happens after the event
The Commission should always be on guard to ensure that implementation takes place properly
And if there is a query about implementation it should be prepared , given the current political climate in Europe , to give unequivocal answers
Parliament has always argued that correspondence regarding possible enforcement proceedings between Member States and the Commission should be shared
It is quite straightforward and I appreciate that your predecessor , Mr Bolkestein , wrote saying that there were reasons for not revealing some of the correspondence
them satisfactory answers
Otherwise we have every right to expect the negative responses that we got in France and Holland
If we cannot answer our citizens‚Äô straightforward questions about how we implement EU law , then it is a poor show
I hope , Commissioner , that you will be able to help us more than your predecessor could
The Commission should reply to Parliament‚Äôs question as to whether the UK properly applied the Non-Life Insurance Directive between 1978 and 2001
As this question relates to the internal market , there are no grounds to refuse to make such a reply
In November 2003 Commissioner Bolkestein refused to give a proper answer
The committees responsible then asked the President of Parliament to take legal action against the Commission
A few months later it was indicated that the necessary legal requirements would not have been met
Now again , a year later , a new resolution has been tabled
Colleagues , we are now eight years on from what was in this case the first of many petitions
It is almost two years since the overwhelming vote on the first resolution on the Lloyd‚Äôs affair
Thousands of citizens were driven into bankruptcy and are now , as we speak , still at risk
Some have committed suicide
This is the result of deliberate and systematic deception in the Lloyd‚Äôs affair
When it is dealing with a petition , not the role , but the credibility of this Parliament is at stake
role in the examination of petitions
Commissioner , if no progress is made , I must conclude that Parliament is unable to help the European citizens who ask for its help
this affair
a Europe that its citizens do not want , as was at least demonstrated by those Europeans who had the opportunity to give their opinion on the matter
out is the gap between the interests of the people and the interest of a very restricted number of plutocrats and speculators
With regard to the Lloyd‚Äôs affair , what was controlled can be very easily identified , whilst , as chance would have it , who controlled it cannot
the UK Treasury
A popular Italian proverb says: ‚ÄòEvery law has its loophole
Lloyd‚Äôs has nearly always won and won for centuries
and mental resources and drawing an income from it
all those , the great majority , who bet their own lives on their work
Mr President , I was disappointed with Commissioner McCreevy‚Äôs reply
We need to distinguish between two issues here
The first is the issue of those who invested in Lloyd‚Äôs and whether or not the British Government is obliged to compensate them for their losses
The Commissioner quite rightly pointed out that it is an issue that has to be pursued through the UK courts
However , what we are specifically dealing with here is the refusal of the Commission to deal properly and in accordance with the Treaties in replying to questions from this House
The Commissioner is explicitly obliged under the Treaties to reply to questions
Tonight , yet again , he has refused to provide all the information that was sought as far back as 2003
On another occasion , a previous Commissioner indicated that the UK Government was unhappy with the Commission revealing the information which was being sought by the Committee on Petitions
the Commission and the Member State
They are not the only ones responsible for the legislation
So I appeal to the Commissioner to avoid the ignominy of being brought before the European Court of Justice by this House for failing to comply with the Treaties
It seems to me , Commissioner , that in any event that you may end up in court if you do not comply
I do not know British law that well , but I suspect that if this case was in Ireland the complainants could force you to produce the information
Court of Justice if you do not provide it

Mr President , the Commission believes it has fulfilled its duties under the Treaty
When doubts were raised , the Commission started an investigation and issued a letter of formal notice and a supplementary letter of formal notice
The Commission has answered questions put to it by the Parliament to the best of its ability
My predecessor met with representatives of the Committee on Petitions and answered questions in this Chamber , as well as many written questions
I have met with Mr Libicki to discuss this matter , and am here again this evening to answer Parliament‚Äôs questions
This is what accountability on the part of the Commission amounts to
authorities
The Commission always endeavours to answer Parliament‚Äôs questions to the best of its abilities
and under a different legislative regime to that which is now in place
The Commission cannot answer that question because the pre-litigation and litigation proceedings that would have established the answer were not completed
‚Äì I have received a motion for a resolution(1) to wind up the debate in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure
The debate is closed
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon
of economic policies (09812/2005 ‚Äì C6-0192/2005 ‚Äì 2005/0064(SYN)) (A6-0204/2005)

of his colleagues at last week‚Äôs summit
The first of these was that they should revisit their own decisions and ensure that these decisions are implemented
The second was that they should abide by the institutional rules
those in positions of responsibility to abide by them
Unfortunately , the appeals fell on deaf ears in the case of too many Heads of State or Government
For many years now , the euro zone finance ministers have also ignored these principles , even though they are necessary for formulating efficient , confidence-building and professional policies
Those who infringed the Stability and Growth Pact have even set themselves up in judgment and prevented the Commission from enforcing the rights conferred upon it
The same happened to Parliament when it considered the two draft Commission regulations on the Stability and Growth Pact
The Commission called on the finance ministers to incorporate Parliament‚Äôs proposals; the President-in-Office of the Council called on his colleagues to take heed of them
During the last part-session , a majority of Members of this House voted in favour of both my reports on the two Commission regulations
accepted by the Council
countries stood in the way of this happening
power to stop anything from happening
This is not a matter of institutional competence; it is a matter of substance
in particular those relating to debt monitoring
first reading
institutional rights and opinions on matters of substance
What do we want
We want a comparison between the data supplied by the Member States to the ECB and that supplied to Eurostat
reported by Greece
our original proposals
We want public debt monitoring , of which there is no mention in the regulation , even though the Council agreed to it in March
We want stability programmes to be submitted annually for a two-year period; yet again , this proposal was rejected
did not wish to accept any of Parliament‚Äôs amendments
An attitude of this kind hardly inspires confidence , and it is not only unwarranted from a factual point of view , but also unfair in institutional terms
I would therefore ask the House to vote tomorrow at second reading in the same way it did at first reading

and yet constructive reform debate
The Commission indicated the need and the main avenues for improving the functioning of the Stability and Growth Pact in its communication of 3 September 2004
After several rounds of discussion , the Ecofin Council met again on 20 March , reached agreement and adopted its report on improving the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact
On 22 March 2005 , the European Council endorsed the report stating that it updates and complements the Stability and Growth Pact
finances and promoting growth
We hold the view that , overall , the agreement is balanced and provides an appropriate basis for restoring national ownership of the fiscal framework
If fully implemented it has the prospect of reinforcing fiscal discipline and growth support of fiscal policies
‚Äì which underpin the pact
Parliament and the Council have immediately begun discussing the Commission proposals in a constructive spirit
All parties strove to bring the process to a successful conclusion swiftly
presidency
Earlier this month , the Parliament adopted at first reading a number of amendments to the Commission proposals
The Council , taking account of Parliament‚Äôs opinion , agreed on its common position shortly thereafter
In its position however , Council could not agree on taking on board any of the amendments proposed by the Parliament
and Growth Pact in line with the overall thrust of the amendments tabled by Parliament
of public finances
In the view of the Commission , the inclusion of some of the amendments tabled by Parliament could have strengthened the proposed regulation further
However , after careful consideration , the Commission decided to accept the Council common position
of the rules
The Commission is committed to a balanced and rigorous implementation of the reformed pact
It continues to closely monitor the budgeting situation in all Member States
It will use its right of initiative where appropriate , as it has done in recent days
As you know , the Commission decided to initiate excessive deficit procedures for Italy and Portugal
We expect the procedures to be seen as a means of supporting the fiscal consolidation needed in both countries to return to high economic growth
in this challenging period

place at this late hour
The Pact is being quietly laid to rest , well away from the public eye
of the Council and the Commission
it cannot agree on a single important issue
inflation
Above all , it is a time when the Commission‚Äôs position must be strengthened
those who violate it sit in judgment on themselves
should have supported such attempts accordingly
The first infringement proceedings against Italy will now make clear what approach the Commission services favour
common currency , even if this means coming out in opposition to the Member States
embodied

Mr President , among the aspects of European cooperation that was left unfinished is European integration and Monetary Union
When it was set up in Maastricht , there were still inspired and visionary Europeans on the scene
Jacques Delors was one of them
would be guaranteed prosperity and welfare
We managed to achieve the first part of the objective beautifully
We have a stable euro that has withstood major currency crises and inflation that is so low that it has now again given economists something to worry about
surprising leaps forward
one Member State‚Äôs frugality from being undermined by another‚Äôs irresponsible overspending
with its system of sanctions , came about; it was , in other words , a pact based on distrust
The pact prescribed quantitative standards for , among others , the net result of annual government budgets and for the level of public debt
That worked at the end of the last century , but the economic situation of the past few years has made these rules appear too rigid
So , on a purely rational basis , it was logical and sensible to change them and to give due priority , once again , to this objective of stability and growth
At the same time , however , a number of large Member States got into difficulty and resisted interference from the Commission and the sanctions of their fellow finance ministers
Consequently , the Commission‚Äôs appropriate adjustment to make the pact more intelligent coincided with a battle for prestige among the Member States
Commissioner Almunia concentrated his efforts on sensible reform , but the eco-feminists wanted , above all , to create room for their own excuse to break the rules
This has therefore been the subject of much heated debate and , in general , most criticism has been levelled at the latter
economic trends and long-term debt
That storm abated
The pact itself has not changed , but an estimate of those budgets is now available to us
this has now entered into effect since last time‚Äôs vote , but that we now have a regulation at second reading on this other , preventive section
I will leave this to one side for the time being
be adopted , the upshot could be that this regulation will not enter into force
the second of which we regard as more important than the first ‚Äì can enter into force simultaneously
Mr Juncker has had a tough time lately , and we should at least let him have this success and result during the Luxembourg Presidency
I would like to appear before you now to support the position of the mover , Mr Karas
I consider several of the reservations and objections from the European Council to be superficial and insufficiently thought through or justified
paragraph 2(a)
viewpoint of maintaining budgetary prudence than absolute data on the level of deficit
I therefore support the position of the European Parliament submitted by Mr Karas in this and other points
Council , where the deviation from the medium-term budget targets in connection with multi-pillar pensions reform has been permitted
the short- or medium-term coverage of pension deficits by one-off and unrepeatable receipts from privatisations , as it happens at present in several European Union countries
lack of economic growth and an inability to create employment
at the end of the day , that those reforms are aimed at producing economic growth and creating employment
That has been the purpose of this European Parliament action: a clearly constructive purpose
Some of us are very critical of the Spring Council; we believe that the Pact should not have been reformed in the way it was
more credible
will be overcome , after ascertaining the situation and the causes of the difficult crisis we are experiencing in Europe

it makes us jealous
European Union needs at the moment and that is what we aspire to
I would like to end by thanking Mr Karas , who has done a commendable job , for his attitude and his work
economy‚Äôs much needed recovery
succession of amendments
and the need to take this process forward
As we know , the Council adopted a motion in March to amend the Stability and Growth Pact and its two pillars
concerns have not been met on any practical level by the economic governance of Europe
It is on this basis that we have to work
The issue before us is not , of course , the sustainability of public finances and , less still , their consolidation
Our priority is rather to make the Pact more effective and easier for society as a whole to understand
I therefore urge common sense so that we can take this process forward
I should also like to point out that the European Central Bank (ECB) finally appears willing to adopt more growth-friendly monetary policies
It is said that interest rates are set to fall
its financial orthodoxy

of the amendments tabled by Parliament at first reading
Unfortunately , as I said in my introductory remarks , the Council did not take our advice on board
Against this background I can understand the position of the House with regard to some of its initial amendments
However , as I stated earlier , I think the common position is generally acceptable; it is broadly balanced and contains the essential elements initially proposed by the Commission
Also against the background of the spreading scepticism surrounding the European project , it is important to demonstrate interinstitutional cohesion regarding this important reform project
Your agreement with the Council‚Äôs common position would help reinforce the pact‚Äôs credibility and political support , sending out a clear message of reform
Finally , let me reassure you again that the Commission is firmly committed to implementing the pact rigorously and even-handedly
The adoption of the reformed pact will help maintain and enforce the solid basis on which that is done
We would like the European Parliament to join the Commission in encouraging Member States to pursue macro-economic stability
The Commission is committed to informing Parliament regularly about relevant developments in budgetary surveillance
‚Äì The debate is closed
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon
Before proceeding to the approval of the amendments to the order of business that have been presented , I would like to make a statement on behalf of
Ladies and gentlemen , 65 years ago today , in June 1940 , three countries which are now members of the European Union ‚Äî Lithuania , Latvia and Estonia ‚Äî lost their independence
This is not the first time that the European Parliament has talked about this , it is not the first time that this Parliament has remembered the past of these
And at these difficult times for the European Union , right now , we must remember that the accession of those Baltic states to the Union has contributed and will continue
It is important to remember this , it is important to remember that the construction of a better future for all Europeans is based on respect for human rights and requires
With the agreement of the political groups , I propose the following amendments to the order of business for the present part-session which appear in the corrigendum that
The report by Mr Gargani on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament will be dealt with immediately after the joint debate on the European Council and the work

With regard to the votes , the report by Mr Bar√≥n Crespo on the protection of occupiers of vehicles in the event of collisions is withdrawn from the agenda , but we
are adding two other items: the two reports by Mr Cavada on Sudan and the Congo , approved in accordance with Rule 131 , and the report by Mr Garriga Polledo and
Mr President , I rise , as announced , pursuant to Rule 132 of the Rules of Procedure , in order to call upon you to remove from the agenda
There has already been one irregular vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs , and , at a time when the EU is in the midst of its direst crisis , it
I therefore call upon you to avail yourself of Rule 132(2) and take appropriate precautions , so that Mr Blair , the British Prime Minister , can talk about a programme of savings
The next item is the joint debate on the European Council report and Commission statement ‚Äì European Council meeting (Brussels , 16-17 June 2005) and the Council
Firstly , we succeeded in leading the European Council or Council of Ministers to take a number of decisions in sectors which , at the start of the year , were acutely
As President of the Eurogroup , I shall work to ensure proper application and judicious interpretation of the Pact which , in future , will pay greater heed to its two equally
Reinforced competitiveness , increasing modernisation in both our attitudes and our economic policies , a renewed determination to innovate and do more in the field of research ‚Äì these are the
major planks of the new strategy , which neither created nor sought deadlock , as some people may initially have wished , either in the area of social cohesion ‚Äì which has been
restored as a major objective , one of the key aims of the European Union ‚Äì or that of an appropriate environmental policy ‚Äì which is emphatically not a threat to
Member States , through national reform programmes , will take greater ownership of the strategy and thus become answerable to their national parliaments in the best national tradition of European texts
The June European Council , held last Thursday and Friday , for the first time in its history approved integrated guidelines , an important event which , alas , has passed virtually unnoticed in the
To those seeking to modernise the European Union , while giving the impression that others are opposed to modernisation , to those who want to respond to the new challenges facing
the European Union while giving the impression that everyone else is unaware of those challenges , I would say: ‚ÄòRead your own decisions and apply them , instead of calling for new
That decision , that advance will increase the level of aid from EUR 46 billion in 2006 to EUR 66 billion by 2010; an increasing contribution , therefore , each year , and ,
Other parts of the world just as wealthy as the Union would do well to take their cue from us to help eradicate poverty , the true scourge of modern
The European Union and the United States jointly organising and co-chairing a conference on Iraq: who would have believed , one year or even six months ago , that , on a

Mr President , in December 2004 , under the Dutch Presidency ‚Äì something we should perhaps not forget ‚Äì the future Luxembourg Presidency was instructed to reach political agreement on the financial
There are those who accuse the Presidency of being responsible for the failure because it sought to achieve the mandate set , both by the previous Presidency and by all
My view is that it a failure for both Europe and for the Presidency , because the disagreement on the financial perspectives , which would have been a minor hiccup under
Firstly , between the position of those Member States who wished to restrict the European budget to 1% , and the Commission‚Äôs more generous initial position , the Presidency proposed , for the
If you then add the 15 hours of debates , negotiation and consultation in the European Council itself , you will see that a total of 65 hours was spent in
The overall economics of the compromise were as follows: the rebate would have continued as before with regard to the 15 previous Member States ‚Äì exactly and precisely as
before ‚Äì but the United Kingdom would have cofinanced the cohesion policy , as normal , solely in the new Member States , while not contributing to the common agricultural policy for those
7 billion , which would have enabled us to adjust the net contribution of the Netherlands by around EUR 1 billion , and to lighten the burdens of Germany and Sweden , in
The Netherlands ‚Äì its Prime Minister , Minister for Foreign Affairs and Finance Minister ‚Äì knew that the Presidency was intending to lighten their country‚Äôs burden by EUR 1 billion
We were unable to do so because the United Kingdom was not prepared to adjust its rebate sufficiently to give us the budgetary headroom needed to cut the Netherlands‚Äô
If the Netherlands had been granted that EUR 1 billion , Germany would have been forced to pay it to the Dutch , because the United Kingdom had not cut its
I wanted you to know this; I did not ask Germany to pay it because Germany , compared to its initial proposal , had already made a huge step towards the
5 billion , would not have enabled all of that to be achieved , but at least it would have enabled the UK to cofinance cohesion policies in the new Member States ,
Moreover , the Presidency proposed a declaration of the European Council in which it would have stated , and I quote , that: ‚Äòmore appropriate consideration should be given to the way in
Trying to get us to say that this reflection should cover the common agricultural policy exclusively was a proposal we knew perfectly well would be unacceptable and thrown out
However , if all sectors , categories and branches concerned had been brought within the scope of our critical budgetary review , this would have enabled the Commission to obtain a positive
We asked the Commission to report on all these aspects , and the Commission agreed to do so , because its President accompanied me throughout every one of the bilateral discussions
We therefore proposed that , on the basis of the Commission‚Äôs report , the European Council should take the appropriate decisions , also , to quote from the text I had proposed: ‚Äòincluding
That was the decision proposed by the Presidency: the British rebate to be maintained for the 15; the British contribution to help finance cohesion policies in the new Member States ,
but with the common agricultural policy in those States excluded; a Commission proposal by the end of 2008 on a restructuring of the budget; the proposal to be examined by
The package was rejected although we had introduced a further EUR 6 billion of extra CAP expenditure for Bulgaria and Romania within the envelope of the decision made in October
Although the letter from the Six could give the impression that they had all concurred that the October 2002 agreement should not be touched , I took this risk upon
Whereas , in 2006 , EUR 42 billion will be spent on direct aid and market measures , the Presidency‚Äôs proposal would have meant , for the 15-State Europe , a cut in that
The Presidency's proposal would have involved a cut from EUR 42 billion of direct aid and market measures to EUR 35 billion in 2013 , which , for the 15-nation Europe ,
And even in the Europe of 27 members , in other words including our Romanian and Bulgarian friends , the CAP would have been reduced by over 5% in the period
We had introduced some changes to the criteria for distribution between the old and new Member States in terms of the cohesion policies , increasing to 53% the total appropriation
If the European Union had proved able to make an effort as proposed by the Presidency , and the Member States had complied with their undertakings in relation to a
If all decisions had been respected and if the Presidency‚Äôs proposals had been accepted , research budgets would have been EUR 785 billion ‚Äì I am referring to the public
We have no right to let down the new Member States which , in all my bilateral discussions with them and in the final and general discussion , behaved with remarkable
We now have to move ahead and find a better formula , if there is one , but this must be done without destroying the mechanisms for cohesion , without watering down
Apart from that , Luxembourg , to which I look forward to returning in the near future to devote myself exclusively to its many and , in the short term , very weighty
Our view ‚Äì not because we are pig-headed , stubborn or short-sighted ‚Äì was that the Constitutional Treaty was not the main issue , but rather that the Constitutional Treaty was
Some Member States , no doubt feeling the need for a period of reflection , explanation and discussion , and therefore of democracy , before going to the people either in parliament or
For my part , I should like this appeal , which was the appeal of the European Council , to be heard and for there to be a longer period of reflection , explanation ,

We need to debate Europe , and I want the institutions of the Union , the European Parliament , the Council , the Commission , the Member States , civil society , unions , political parties and
I want the Commission , the guardian not only of the Treaty but above all of the spirit of the Treaty , and of the European ambition , to be at the
This is not to give the impression that everything is inspired , managed and predetermined in Brussels , but is aimed to ensure that this 27-times national , and therefore European , debate
Mr President , I invite , recommend and urge you to involve both yourself in person and the Commission in that debate; I know you are eager to do it; you must
We are told , and I have said so myself , that during the budget debate we have seen a stand-off between two concepts of Europe: one based rather more on market
This explanatory debate must be used to reconcile these two segments of public opinion which , today , do not talk to one another , staring at one another like statues , unable
But I was considerably reassured to read that those who had thought , after the latest European Council , that there had been a clash , a conflict between two visions of
The less we invest in political union , the more we ‚Äì unknowingly , unconsciously and imperceptibly ‚Äì pave the way , with an implacable logic , for the concept of a free
When this concept has been achieved , it will appear to have been an altogether natural development and one which rules out any possibility of going back ‚Äì and supporters
At the end of this Presidency , Mr President , I wanted to remind you , this time without quoting myself , that at the outset I had insisted on the need to respect
It was a great pleasure to work with this Commission , and especially with its President , and I should like to thank the Commission and its President for the large
We often disagreed , either because your proposals were not sensible , or because the sensible proposals of the Presidency were not accepted by all Member States and therefore could not
I am not saying this paternalistically or with condescension , but I can gauge it by the depth of explanations , the intensity and quality of today‚Äôs debates compared to those
I shall be very sorry not to be able to come to the European Parliament so regularly in future to participate in this great European debate , both here in

Mr President , Mr Juncker , ladies and gentlemen , once upon a time , one of my teachers advised me always to be pessimistic because , that way , all
To judge from the reactions and events of the past few days , pessimism would seem to be fully justified , but I must tell you that I do not believe
Let me start by going back , from the Commission‚Äôs viewpoint , over these last six months , a period that has been marked by the experience and the European conviction of
However , the greatest success of the Luxembourg Presidency , from the point of view of the Commission‚Äôs priorities , may have been the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy during the Spring European
It is worth remembering that , however important the interinstitutional debate is , the majority of Europeans , when they get together as a family , at school , at work or at leisure , do
President Juncker has already mentioned this: the summit with Russia , those with Canada and the United States , the better relationship we now have with our great partner on the
During the last European Council , we primarily discussed two questions: what should we do during this period following the referenda in the Netherlands and France and what should we do
You doubtless remember that the Commission said , just on the eve of the European Council , that it , for its part , wanted to launch this debate by going , if necessary ,
and this is what we are going to do , to all the Member States of the EU to debate and to listen , not only to the governments , which is certainly
We are very proud that the European Council has given us a mandate to have a special role in this enterprise , in this debate that must be organised in
We are sure that the European Parliament will have a contribution , a very important contribution , to make to this debate and we , the European Commission , want to work with
If we do not reach agreement , then there is a risk of paralysis which will have a very negative effect on our policies and on all the Member States ,
The problems we now have in Europe are not the result of the demands of the new Member States; they are not the cause of the problems we have
The problem , when the Council reduced the ambition of proposal by the Commission and Parliament , and when the Council decided to follow the ‚Äòone per cent club‚Äô , was that
The common agricultural policy was , of course , maintained in accordance with the agreement made three years ago , but there were major cuts in the areas of competitiveness , growth , innovation
It is easier to get a coalition for a ‚Äòno‚Äô vote than to get a coalition for a ‚Äòyes‚Äô , when what we need in Europe now are coalitions for
We want to be sure that when the European Council is ready to reach an agreement it can be swiftly followed by the signing of an interinstitutional agreement between
This means that , as we do not know exactly what the world will be like in 2013 , we should not have an overall debate before we approve the financial
On the contrary , we should approve the financial perspective as soon as possible and then arrange a meeting later in order to adapt our budget to changing priorities and
If we do not do this , we could fail , and it is my duty to draw the attention of this Parliament to a risk of paralysis in the European
There was also the very important decision to confirm at the highest level ‚Äì at a European Union summit ‚Äì the decisions taken by the development ministers following a

Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I would like , before all else , to express the heartfelt gratitude of the
Group of the European People‚Äôs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to Mr Jean-Claude Juncker , the President-in-Office of the European Council , for the great passion and conviction with which he

Any attempt at analysis must start from the situation as it now stands , and to those who say , ‚Äòwe are in a state of political crisis‚Äô , I say , ‚ÄòI agree
We must , though , make it our concern that this political crisis should not disorient us and seduce us into activity for activity‚Äôs sake , and so we must respond with
We believe in this Europe of ours , and , for that reason , the political will must be there to lead this Europe of ours , this European Union , into a bright
We find ourselves , though , in a twofold crisis of confidence; one that involves various protagonists in the European Council and has been building up for several years , and a crisis
We want a European Union that is strong , effective and democratic , and all those who want to make it no more than a free trade zone within Europe will
We say the same thing to those who believe that what we need today is the rebuilding of axes; we have heard of one proposal for a Franco-German Union ,
To those who think like this I have this to say: on the contrary , while we need good bilateral relationships , they must be offered to the European Union as a
Rather than having a respite from thinking , we must use the time we now have in order to think and to ensure that , when this process of reflection is
If I may turn to the European Union‚Äôs budget , we find the failure to achieve a result regrettable , but we ‚Äì including Reimer B√∂ge , who is present in the Chamber

This Financial Perspective is needed ‚Äì and I say this with the utmost seriousness ‚Äì for those countries in Central and Eastern Europe that joined the European Union on 1
It is for that reason that I hope we will be able to complete this Financial Perspective , which we owe to the European Union‚Äôs new Member States , under the

The fact is that , for years , the people who hold the reins of power in Europe ‚Äì in other words , the European Council , the Heads of State or Government
It became clear from last weekend‚Äôs summit that we can now put a name to what has caused Europe to lose out: the particularism of those Heads of State or
Parliaments exist to give expression to what the public feels , and you are right to say that high diplomacy belongs somewhere else; this is where the truth has to be
We have lessons to learn from that , and one important one is that we should start by noting that , of the three institutions , two have done their homework; the
Above all else , I simply do not see how a head of government , of whatever country , can say , ‚ÄòI have quite specific goals‚Äô , and then , by his own actions ,
We do , of course know that our continent‚Äôs ability to survive depends on our promotion of innovation , research and technology , and that these things are crucial to the Lisbon
Let me tell you what I think , what my very personal opinion is: it is that the reason lies in the fact that , this weekend , European policy was , yet again ,
There may be many more internal policy considerations than these two , the effects of which on European policy we Europeans have to live with , so let us , in this
Nobody will be able to make the Treaty of Nice serve as the basis for a free trade zone; it may be inadequate , but it has taken the process
What the people of Europe are now waiting for , though , is signals from Europe; we do indeed need the market , we do indeed need internal and external competition , but
those in the Netherlands and in France who voted ‚Äòno‚Äô did so not least because they feared that this market , this competition , would wreck their social security , destroying what has

Mr Juncker , I also say to you that if you genuinely wished to continue your work , you could perhaps have chosen the presidency of another , rather more stable institution ,
Luxembourg and its Prime Minister have steered the Union well during these turbulent months but that has not helped to restore confidence among the French and Dutch electorate , or to
The European Council has only confirmed the reality of a divided Europe of governments , which is perhaps not even very interested in nursing a genuine ambition in the face
We regret , Mr Juncker , that the last action of your Presidency has been to put forward a genuinely unacceptable budget proposal , unacceptable because it follows the same failing logic of
It is also true , however , that even your proposal included cutbacks to positive policies ‚Äì to the development policy , to the rural development policy , and even to the sacred
We therefore genuinely hope that , once your Presidency has come to an end , your government will throw out such a proposal , partly because we believe that that could help
For now they are the only ones who have been strengthened by the twin ‚Äòno‚Äô vote , and I believe that we will have further confirmation of that tomorrow , when
My group therefore believes that the failure to reach an unsatisfactory agreement on the financial perspectives is a positive result and considers it important that the Council has given itself
We believe , however , that this reflection needs to be given time , method and clear objectives , and that , in terms of the financial perspectives , difficult chapters that already seemed to be
We therefore might as well begin to sharpen our weapons , Mr Juncker , because it is really not worth losing our way in abstruse compromises , even if they have brought
If we genuinely believe that political union remains the aim , and if we are genuinely ashamed of having to accept the initiative of the ten new Member States on the

Then , Mr Barroso , we also have to do ‚Äòsomething European‚Äô , in the words of a famous Italian film director , something quite different from the Bolkestein Directive , software patenting , the arbitrary

Reflection on the future of Europe and its legitimacy will be made much easier if Europe has something to offer in the months to come: REACH , an action on

Mr President , Mr Juncker , Mr Barroso , I would like to start by extending my warmest thanks to Mr Juncker for the respect he has just shown

It has decided to continue with the process of ratifying the ex-Constitutional Treaty by , and I quote , ‚Äòaltering the timetable according to circumstances‚Äô , which is a singularly cavalier attitude
Primarily , the European Council has , moreover , provided European opinion with the grossest caricature of this commercial , egotistical , directionless Europe , which our fellow citizens , as it happens , have quite rightly
Beyond that , it is the whole club of six , these countries which have , for months , been consumed by their obsession to freeze budgets at 1% of European revenues , that ,
What real alternatives are there , not only in budgetary terms , but in terms of the direction of the institutional criteria: that , in the opinion of my group , is the agenda
for the great citizens‚Äô debate that we need to have on a European scale , and which I called for during our last part-session by quite particularly addressing the left of
It seems to me that three of the conditions for the success of such a debate are , first , that it should be free from any pressure; next , that it
should be open to actual citizens and not to institutional representatives of civil society; and , finally , that it should result in a new treaty that our fellow citizens can support
I would add that the specific decisions that will be taken at European level during this pause for reflection must also demonstrate , in the eyes of our fellow citizens , our
You always do things well at a technical level , but today I must criticise you , Mr Juncker , for the summit‚Äôs decision to continue the ratification process with a document

In truth , these two visions are two sides of the same coin ‚Äì without economic and also social integration it will not be possible to build a sustainable edifice

My second message I bring as one who survived the Second World War , as one who , well advanced in years , is able , in this House , to work for the European

I would ask whether it is not the case that relations have improved because the EU has turned a blind eye to Russia‚Äôs impertinent treatment of Poland and the
Unless the common foreign policy is to be devoid of any practical sense , it should seek to achieve a minimum level of security for all Member States , rather than
You have shown that the authority of a Presidency can be measured by its willingness to place the common interest above its own national interest and it is on
The first is that certain governments are calling for all the EU‚Äôs policies to be sent back to the drawing board , which is what the European Parliament did after
My second comment is that the lack of a position from the Council must not delay the implementation of the new cohesion policy or that of the new Framework Programme
My third comment , finally , is that the Council has failed , not on the main subject of the level of budgetary expenditure , but on the method of financing a budget that
There can be no agreement on future expenditure without , at the same time , reform of the revenue system , and this subject is too important to be left just to
We propose that the EU‚Äôs system of own resources should be examined in the context of an interparliamentary conference bringing together the European Parliament and the national parliaments to
Madam President , for the new Member States , these last six months have been a period rich in success , even if these successes were the fruit of
Those who opposed the rapid ratification of the European Constitution did not take account of the fact that , at the same time , they were weakening the position of the
It would therefore be wise to stop and think and to devote some time now to analysis and listening and to reflection upon how we might move on so
More than ever , there is a need for leadership and for someone who dares to stand up for visionary ideals and for European cooperation and to defend the decisions
In that context , the President-in-Office of the Council deserves all credit , partly for his candid speech and partly for his attempt to reconcile desires that are very much at
The list of foreign policy measures ‚Äì 33 pages of the Council‚Äôs conclusions ‚Äì was certainly compiled before the Council meeting even began but nonetheless gives the appearance of
In many ways , Europe is the answer to what is at issue in these countries , even if it does not perhaps quite appear to our own people to be
Europe is worth it , but in that case we must really make an effort and ensure that the current hiatus in the ratification process does not also extend to
Madam President , Mr Schmit , I do not know whether you can find space at the front there for all the flowers with which this House is
I echo all the gratitude that has been expressed , and wish to add another bloom for the courage that this presidency , the government of Luxembourg , has displayed by organising
It may be , Mr Schmit , that the result of this decision will be that there will one day be only one founding state in a politically united Europe rather than
It may be that this decision represents the victory of the idea of a politically united Europe over the vulgar idea of a common market , of the ideal of
Tomorrow we will hear someone who broadcasts abroad for all to hear the propaganda of a Europe of nationalism and national corridors of power , adducing also the Rumsfeld formula
according to which Europe is divided into ‚Äòold‚Äô and ‚Äònew‚Äô , and thereby taking us back to the 19th century , to a Europe characterised by balances of power , by struggles for
I hope that the referenda will not be misinterpreted and will not be turned on their heads in such a way that their outcomes can be used against the
It is disappointing to see how various Heads of Government throw their entire weight behind a text that has , to all intents and purposes , been thrown out , thus needlessly
The optimistic references to a common destiny in the preamble ring false in the ears of someone from a country that , while supposedly fat and stuffed to the gullet ,
It is impossible , and indeed undesirable , to indicate policy priorities in a new multi-annual budget and to allocate funds to them while the reflection period and the reformulation of
A fundamental choice needs to be made between the Baltic perspective , the Mediterranean perspective or a balanced mix of the two; a decision needs to be made on whether
or not to actually pursue the Lisbon objectives by means of practical and coherent measures; the foundations on which political integration is to be established need to be redefined; and
We furthermore believe that actions promoting the creation of a common European spirit are essential , as it can only be created by means of a gradual and progressive harmonisation of
Madam President , I hope that Minister Schmit can hear me , because I would like to say that what the citizens are demanding now , quite rightly , is
It is incredible that certain Member States should make all kinds of statements of a Europeanist nature , saying that they want more Europe inside and outside our borders , while at
I would therefore like to ask whether it is true that there have even been certain Member States that have promised their support in the final vote and have
It is precisely because of cases such as this , and regardless of what is laid down in the draft Constitutional Treaty , that debates in the Council must be made
Madam President , I would like firstly to thank the Luxembourg Presidency for the efforts and imagination it has applied to trying to reach an agreement on
We have seen once again that the European leaders have not been a match for the circumstances: they have been unable to go beyond their exercise in national accounting , and
The Commission has done its job; as has the European Parliament: it has adopted its position by a large majority and , for the first time in its history , showing responsibility
On the other hand , the Council is having increasing difficulties adopting a position and this is regrettable since it leads to a lack of leadership which undermines the foundations
I would like to point out that our group will stand by its commitments and that , if no financial perspectives are forthcoming , it will fully apply the provisions of Article
Let us be serious , representatives of the Council: it is not possible at the last minute to say that we must change the Union‚Äôs spending philosophy , it is not possible
If the financial perspectives offer any added value , it consists of safeguarding and guaranteeing the programming of the Union‚Äôs cohesion policies , which , apart from being a mechanism for solidarity
and for correcting territorial imbalances , are the most important Community public instrument , and are able to generate investment , economic growth and employment , and hence attract the citizens to the European
Without one , we could of course draw up an annual budget on the basis of Article 272 of the Treaty , but it will not guarantee sustained and balanced development
The new legislative plans for these areas are now being debated in Parliament , but it is difficult to make the final decisions when one does not know how much
When financing for the present programming period was decided at the Agenda 2000 talks in Berlin , just six months before that period began , the outcome was that structural policy
Now the situation is still more difficult , as we have 10 new Member States for which it is a problem even to estimate the extent of future structural and
For the first time in the process of the construction of the EU , there has been a big difference ‚Äì in France and in the Netherlands ‚Äì between the
We are pro-European , we want a united Europe and we are working for it , but we the Catalans and other Europeans from stateless nations do not believe that we
The answer is not to stop , but , rather , to have the courage to initiate a fresh , genuinely democratic , constitutional process; the answer is not to head down a cul-de-sac ,
Thirdly , the draft Constitution included all sorts of plans for common defence , a common foreign policy and a host of other things that absolutely should not have been addressed
We must begin again from the beginning , show respect for the people‚Äôs decision and then review that decision from a democratic point of view with democratically elected people in the
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the main reason for reviewing the course of any presidency of the EU Council seems to be to gain an opportunity
What makes the crisis dual in nature is the fact that , on the one hand , the referenda in France and the Netherlands have shown evident and massive public rejection of
the way the EU is going at present , irrespective of domestic political concerns , while , on the other , the failure of the summit has shown that , even at Council level , among
What is demonstrated not only by this rejection on the part of the public but also by the tactical infighting on internal policies and national egoisms within the Council
Let us get away from a Union characterised by the egoisms of bureaucrats , lobbyists and technocrats with no knowledge of the people; let us move on to a Europe
It cannot be right that in a Union of 25 Member States , 42 per cent of our budget goes to the CAP , while less than 4 per cent of
How can we tolerate a system that sees the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , sitting in session here in Brussels , demanding quite correctly ever more draconian
regulations on the sale and marketing of tobacco products that kill half a million of our citizens every year , while across the corridor the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development
Our brave words about achieving the goals of the Lisbon Strategy , about facing up to the challenges of globalisation , about increased competitiveness and economic reform are never matched by
We have virtually abandoned the Stability and Growth Pact; we have begun a predictable and wholescale retreat from the Services Directive; we voted in this House to end the
opt-out on the Working Time Directive , and meanwhile the Commission is preparing to unveil another 900 new directives: more red tape , more bureaucracy , more interference in the lives of our
I am very pleased that the summit decided , not on a Plan B , which would involve halting the ratification process and re-negotiating the text , but on a Plan D , which
I hope that the referendum in Luxembourg will be a success , for we will then have two popular ‚Äòyes‚Äô votes against two ‚Äòno‚Äô votes , which might give the go-ahead
The topics for debate are obvious , including as they do the role of the EU in globalisation , the exit routes from the economic and employment crisis , the EU‚Äôs frontiers
If Giscard d‚ÄôEstaing‚Äôs idea of a Congress of Peoples had not been blown out of the water after being proposed to the Convention , I would almost regard it as
Madam President , Mr Schmit , ladies and gentlemen , the Luxembourg Presidency will be remembered for having coincided with external events , which , although forcing the European project to
The solution to global problems of the past , a past in which , for us , the world and Europe were the same thing , enables us to state that that period
The achievement of peace and stability within Europe , the prosperity ensured by the construction of the internal European market through successive enlargements , and the fostering of the very many cultures
within Europe , which can all be traced back to common Judaeo-Greco-Christian roots , make the founding fathers‚Äô original project substantially complete , even if the full and necessary involvement of south-eastern Europe
Today , the same issues ‚Äì peace , prosperity and identity ‚Äì can only be resolved on an international scale , with global actors demanding a European actor that is equal to the
task , more unified , more integrated , more directly accountable towards the European people , without unnecessary , if not downright harmful intermediation by the Member States , and , for that very reason , able to
The Luxembourg Presidency has done its best to mitigate the impact of external events , despite the bleak economic situation in many of the largest Member States and the difficult employment
conditions , and despite a Council of 25 operating in accordance with the rules of the Treaty of Nice and a Commission that is still not fully able to instil Community
The defence of the fundamental completeness of the Stability and Growth Pact , the stimulus to ratify the Constitutional Treaty , the open-handed and determined search for agreement on the budget ,
Above all , however , the Luxembourg Presidency has taught us that the Union , in anticipation of more appropriate constitutional procedures , such as those laid down by the Constitutional Treaty , has to
Without giving in to a state of panic , without preventing itself from continuing to utilise the existing treaties in order to protect and to increase the European of common
If anyone or anything has shown itself lacking in maturity , it is not Europe , but the Council , which has brought discredit upon itself as a legislative institution , and it
His demand , though , is a hypocritical one , for he was among those who put the brakes on the last time there was a reform , when he prevented direct payments
What that boils down to is that his flagging up of agricultural policy is retribution for the demand ‚Äì which most of us do in any case support ‚Äì
Mr President , when Mr Juncker came to this Parliament in January to set out his presidency‚Äôs priorities , the UK Independence Party reminded him that he had
It has been suggested in the media that Mr Blair allowed the rebate to be discussed when such discussions were not necessary , thereby falling into a trap laid by President
His quote , ‚ÄòI want to believe obstinately that neither the French or the Dutch have rejected the Constitutional Treaty‚Äô , will go down in history as being typical of the
Under it the precious Constitution has been shipwrecked on the rocks of rejection and the budget is an unmitigated shambles , with rancour , as in Mr Juncker‚Äôs speech today , being
Root and branch changes are essential , in which the primacy of the nation state should be reestablished and Brussels centralisation reversed , with wide-ranging powers repatriated to national governments and
‚Äì Mr President , given my institutional role in the European Parliament , I should be speaking about the failure of the Brussels summit in relation to cohesion , a
failure which saddens us all and creates problems with the timely start of the programmes for the new period , for 2007-2013 , in connection with the Community Support Framework and regional
I wonder why those who raised the subject were unable to raise it in 2002 when they signed off everything to do with the CAP and the agricultural budget
Commissioner , Mr Barroso , Mr Juncker , first of all , it is my turn to thank the Luxembourg Presidency for its efforts and , above all , for its method ,
Gentlemen of the Council  in passing , I would point out that there were very few women there and I think that parity within the Council would bring progress in
the political habits of that institution  so , gentlemen of the Council , what has become of your commitments to boost growth and innovation so that everybody can find a good
We in Parliament are prepared to continue negotiations with the European Council as soon as it has its feet back on the ground , but above all when it has
Our European utopia does exist , but it needs a broader , more generous , more ambitious , more humanist vision with greater solidarity , shared by the citizens and respected by the Council , so
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this first half-year has been especially full of major challenges for the future of the European Union: the reform of the
It then suffered an unfortunate setback in the European Council last Thursday and Friday , which , without doubt , does not help Europe to build an effective relationship with the citizens ,
With regard to the original , very restrictive proposal , a step forward was made at the start of the summit , which I personally do not believe was satisfactory , and which ,
Parliament , however , had sent out a significant positive signal by approving the B√∂ge resolution by a large majority and by reaching full agreement with the position of the European
Personally speaking , I hope ‚Äì and I conclude ‚Äì that after last week‚Äôs unpleasant test , a balanced agreement is reached , mindful of the prevailing positions , and that that occurs as
Mr President , as the Group of the European People‚Äôs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats‚Äô coordinator on our parliamentary steering group for the Lisbon strategy , I
Satisfaction about the fact that under the Luxembourg Presidency , the Lisbon strategy was given another shot in the arm and can really get underway now that this last , particularly
In order to be able to carry out our part of the bargain , we need money; the failure to reach agreement on the financial package means that this is
We should use that time to turn the European Union once more into a project with visible added value , added value for all those people who worry about their
People who find the EU‚Äôs enlargement too much to handle because they were given far too little information in their own countries and who also fear the globalisation process ,
‚Äì Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I should like to begin by commending the Commission and the Luxembourg Presidency on their endeavours to prevent
While this House adopts the Constitutional Treaty by a two-thirds majority , there is no shortage of Heads of Government who cannot get a majority for more democracy , citizens‚Äô rights
While the European Parliament , out of the desire to make the European Union more effective , efficient and economical , adopts the Financial Perspective , there are Heads of Government sitting on the
Council who disregard their own decisions , ignore treaties , undermine the common goal of developing the European Union further into a political union and fail to abide by the rules of
I get the impression that there are too many for whom mass appeal in their own countries is more important than their responsibility to the Community , who prefer to blame
If you want to regain the public‚Äôs confidence in the European project as a success story , you cannot make them believe things , you cannot take them for mugs or
ignore their worries and fears; instead , you have to meet them halfway , tell them how things are , do what you have decided to do and keep to what you have
If you want to put an end to double standards behind padded doors , you have to give parliaments more of a say in decision-making processes and say a resounding
More and more , I come to the conclusion that all those who are really serious about seeking political union and putting this continent in a stronger position on the world
I think that the citizens knew perfectly well what they were doing when they voted , and claiming that they voted the wrong way because they did not understand is ,
For this reason , we need to establish whether or not this terrible logic of a fair return , which was instituted by Mrs Thatcher several years ago and clearly continues
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the failure of the summit and , not least , the circumstances surrounding it , are symptomatic of the deep crisis that we are
What we do need , though , and urgently , is a basic agreement setting out how decisions are to be taken in the European Union , and how the institutions ‚Äì Council ,
Such are the essential elements of what we need , and of what will enable us to organise and manage a Union of 25 or even more Member States in
A halt must be called to the process of enlargement until such time as we have consolidated the last additions , and I would also point out that most people
Mr President , Council , Commissioner Wallstr√∂m , ladies and gentlemen , when you took over the Presidency in Luxembourg , you had to deal with a natural disaster in the
Rather , what has emerged from the referenda is that people want the EU to do more of the right things and the Council to concentrate on the right things ,
People want us to be clearer about the objectives , that is to say more jobs , a proper state of affairs in the labour market , social responsibility , international solidarity , the
It is not enough for ourselves here in Brussels to do lots of good things if no one knows about what we are doing or takes any notice of
After all , a large majority of this House has spoken out in favour of cutting back where possible but also investing where necessary , which was also the thrust of
If , however , newspapers carry reminders , year in and year out , that the Dutch contribute many times more than other rich countries , then the Netherlands , having been a pro-European country ,
That means that not only the position of candidate Member States must be taken seriously , but also the criteria we prescribed in respect of enlargements , and that guarantees must
It is impressive how he , time and again , underlined the idea that Europe is about cooperation , is more than just a free trade area , not only in his work
I told Mr Juncker a moment ago that he is a leader of a small country but a big leader in Europe , and I am convinced that , if we carry
The ease with which Europe stumbled into crisis sends a very disturbing message , namely that peace and progress in Europe are regarded by people and their political
If it is true that they depend on an increasing cohesion of European nations , of their mutuality and solidarity , then all of us who believe in the European idea must ,
Will we be capable of giving the idea of political union some new impetus , some new inspiration , and can we move ahead , or will we be content merely with
If we have therefore found ourselves in a crisis , then I propose that we do not resolve it with some minor corrections , but rather that we focus back on the
This includes ‚Äì and I do not advocate the approach of Prime Minister Blair , although I would like to draw attention to a certain position of his which seems
to me relevant to our deliberation over this future ‚Äì whether from the aspect of the Lisbon objectives it is right for us to allocate almost half of the Union‚Äôs
Mr President , discouragement and determination are two words that begin with ‚Äòd‚Äô and which I believe accurately reflect the feelings of Mr Juncker today and of
many Members of this House: discouragement in view of what happened at the European Summit , determination to face the future: discouragement , because Mr Juncker , on describing the debate on the
I believe that , if there has been an example of vision and ambition at this Summit the vision and ambition that has always characterised Europeanism then that example has
With regard to the Constitution , Mr President , I believe that what is going to happen in practice , which is the suspension of the referenda , is a good thing: this is
I therefore believe that the idea of establishing the end of the Austrian Presidency as the time for relaunching the process is a good one and I believe that
In this respect , the resolution that will be voted on tomorrow contains a clause that moves in that direction and I believe that it conforms to that ‚Äòd‚Äô for
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Luxembourg on three things: firstly , on having defended the European Constitution during its Presidency of the Council firmly and
And thirdly , because Mr Juncker spoke very clearly yesterday , at the summit with the United States , when he used a phrase that filled me with pride and emotion: ‚ÄòEurope
That is more or less what those of us , for example , who represented this Parliament as observers during the Lebanese elections that ended this weekend , said: Europe exists and
So that we can remain in limbo , so that we can go backwards , have less Europe , come to a halt and ultimately allow the rhythm of the world to
I believe that we must state very clearly that , if we believe that the European Constitution is good , it must not be renegotiated and that , however long it may
I would like to remind you , Mr President , that it is not the case that there have only been two referenda so far and that they have both said ‚Äòno‚Äô:
In fact , if we add up the ‚Äòyes‚Äô votes and the ‚Äòno‚Äô votes in the referenda held to date , there are more ‚Äòyes‚Äô votes than ‚Äòno‚Äô votes , and far
I am one of those who want more Europe and I therefore believe , from the point of view of the left , that what the citizens want is more and
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , to return to what President Barroso said , I would first of all like to say thank you to Mr Juncker and
I congratulate the Luxembourg Presidency on having been , for almost six months , a good Presidency , I could say a full Presidency , without a moment‚Äôs rest , a committed Presidency , a
True , the last Council did not give the results we were hoping for , but Mr Juncker has given us a clear explanation of the content of the negotiations , of
We were a few millimetres from agreement , when the Presidency and the Commission had succeeded in getting most of the delegations to move kilometres , and that is really something
I , though , would like to be a little less discreet by saying that it is clear that this Presidency , up to the end of June , and the next one
will have to ask themselves whether , with regard to the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey , we can make it seem that , and act as if , nothing had changed since
December 2004 , as if Turkey had not slackened its efforts , as if Europe had produced a Constitution and as if it had produced a budget: it has no Constitution , it
Therefore , I would say very clearly that I think that , at the moment , we are not meeting the Copenhagen criterion on the ability of the EU to take on new
members without losing momentum , and I would simply say , Mr President , that it would send a very strong signal if we said to the people: Europe is taking its destiny
‚Äì Mr President , it has been said that the small countries are organising and setting their seal on the big presidencies of the European Union with their
This crisis was confirmed and reinforced by the breakdown of the European Council , despite the brave and honourable efforts made by the Luxembourg Presidency to broker a reasonable compromise
As the fabricated fear of enlargement affected the ratifying process in France and the Netherlands , it was judged expedient to dedicate literally two lines , almost hidden away in the
This strategic plan , which made the European Union a strong , international factor , is not defended by anyone today in the face of the fear cultivated by the more conservative
Mr President , last week‚Äôs European Council was a clear reminder that the European Union cannot carry on with business as usual following the French and Dutch
It is against this backdrop that , with respect , I have to disagree with the President-in-Office when he said that he did not believe the French or the Dutch voters
In the coming months we will argue positively and enthusiastically for a different kind of Europe that goes with the grain of public opinion and not against it; a
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Juncker and his dedicated political colleagues in his excellent diplomatic and civil service on the job they have
I would also like to remind the House that 28 states ‚Äì not 25 ‚Äì participated in the Convention and that at least Turkey , Bulgaria and Romania should be
I believe that if they are going to be full members of this Union within a number of years then they have a right to participate in debating what
This is the kind of politics that the people of Europe are crying out for and I would urge this House to insist that from tomorrow onwards all presidencies
I would like to ask Mr Juncker in the remaining days of his presidency , Mr Borrell and Mr Barroso , to support that initiative and demonstrate to the people of
It would be a betrayal of the sweat and blood of our parents and grandparents and the lessons that they learned from having a divided Europe; from having a
‚Äì Mr President , my speech will be shorter , as Mr Juncker has already mentioned many of the questions I wished to express an opinion on in his
If it was perhaps the case a few decades ago that we still had the Berlin Wall , we still had the cold war , and that this perhaps instinctively united
That is why it is also essential to look at what are Europe‚Äôs values; and Europe‚Äôs values today are obviously its people , for we have to take into account
If , for example , solidarity towards the new Member States is nothing more than a mention in a speech in honour of a special occasion , the people do not need
They lack the courage to tell the electorate that there is no alternative to globalisation , and that it cannot be opposed through political decisions , but that we could adapt
The same leaders , who in speeches complain that the Lisbon strategy is very much late in coming , allow a situation where not even the decisions agreed in one country are
In the end , however , the bills for our common decisions are paid for out of national budgets , and , consequently , only the French Government can explain to its citizens with
any credibility that the position of agriculture in this continent has changed , and only the British can make their own citizens understand that the rebate Britain receives on its EU
The polarisation of Europe we are currently witnessing is a result of the EU‚Äôs financial crisis , which in turn has been triggered by its
It would appear that Europe risks being divided into two camps; on the one side advocates of closer political integration combined with efforts to achieve a more social Europe ,
The EU must continue to move towards a more stable institutional framework , just as it must reform its budget and concentrate its resources on areas that will allow us
Similarly , there is public support for France and Germany‚Äôs attempts to achieve closer political integration , but not if this involves inefficient welfare systems and protectionist approaches being set in
The EU will not find a way out of its current crisis if it tries to lay down its institutional framework at the same time as deciding on the
The incoming presidency has a unique chance to make its attempts to reform the EU‚Äôs budget and economy more credible , namely by ensuring that its first objective is to achieve
Although he comes from a small country , Mr Juncker is a great statesman and a great politician , and he has demonstrated quite clearly that small and medium-sized countries can
It is my belief that Jean-Claude Juncker will always serve as a fine example , in particular for the new Member States , or in other words the small and medium-sized

In common with the majority of Members of this House , I supported this move , and despite the events in France and the Netherlands , I still believe that it was
Regardless of the problems we are facing , we should not ignore the fact that the unification of Europe is in the interests of Europe as a whole , and in
Last year‚Äôs enlargement demonstrated that the problem does not lie with the new Member States , since they are acting with the utmost responsibility , whether with regard to ratification of
The first point is that we should not blame Luxembourg; quite the contrary: it did an excellent job with the presidency and showed what small countries can do while
If he can do this he can grab the leadership vacuum , but unfortunately what we have seen and heard from Tony Blair when he has tried to get into
This does little to captivate the imagination and aspirations of those we serve and has huge anomalies ‚Äì not least vis-√†-vis Luxembourg , the richest EU country and , at the

The ratification of the Constitutional Treaty should not be an end in itself , and agitators and expounders will be of no help in this situation , no matter how highly
The citizens' Europe proclaimed by us should become a reality , and this means that we must listen attentively to the voice of the citizens if we want to avoid
Analysis shows that in France and the Netherlands the European Union Constitutional Treaty was largely rejected because the door was left open to Turkey to become a European Union member
It is important that there should be a financial agreement , but it is even more important that we should avoid a situation where the new Member States are bound
I myself concur fully with the views expressed by President Barroso at the start of the debate , and in particular with his comments on the reasons why no compromise
We will never achieve dynamic economic growth in Europe if nearly one quarter of the EU‚Äôs population is deprived of the substantial support it will need over the next few

Given that the agreement in the Council was an agreement that would , in any event , still have had to be negotiated with your Parliament , it is an illusion to
think that the Council alone decides on the financial perspectives , since it is clear that the Council can only reach an agreement within the interinstitutional framework with the assent of
I will not talk about the definition of the richest countries ‚Äì I do not want to get involved in that kind of discussion ‚Äì but what I have noticed
However , I do not want to conclude this assessment of the Luxembourg Presidency without stressing , as Mr Harbour did , that , although there has been a failure with respect to the
I note , for example , that there has been an agreement , thanks in part to your Parliament , on the ‚Äòexternal borders‚Äô code: this is vital if we are to increase
The same is true of the approvals at second reading , without recourse to conciliation , in a field such as car insurance , which has a direct effect on citizens who
I wish you all the courage and all the creativity that you have shown before to feed this debate , so that we can extricate ourselves as quickly as possible
Mr President , first of all I would like to join all those who have expressed their sincere admiration and gratitude to Jean-Claude Juncker , Minister Schmit and their team for
We often talk about the sense of State in relation to great statesmen and women , but it is high time to introduce the concept of a sense of Europe ,
The most significant expression of this crisis is perhaps the feeling of confusion that we now perceive among the public and in the very basic questions that citizens have
It is also about quality of life and they expect the European Union to deliver and to establish policies which affect their quality of life , the environment and all
These are the questions that European citizens will continue to put to all our institutions and it is our joint responsibility to provide the answers , as far as we
That puts a bigger responsibility on the other two corners , the Commission and Parliament , but in this debate I have seen that there is a willingness and determination to
The Commission will accept its responsibility and we will also immediately start to work on the ‚Äòstrategic roadmap‚Äô , which will hopefully provide some more of the responses to the very
We will , more than ever , need the input , cooperation and support of this House and all of those , who like Mr Juncker , have developed the sense of Europe and are
‚Äì This was a European Council in which the impact of the double victory for the no campaign , in the French and Dutch referenda of 29 May
This victory paved the way for combating the increasingly neoliberal guidelines that have gradually been introduced in the EU in recent years , and that have ultimately been enshrined in
From a political and legal point of view , the people dealt the Constitutional Treaty a deadly blow in these referenda , given that a Treaty can only enter into force
The European Council of 16 and 17 June had the evidence staring it in the face , yet it chose to ignore it , preferring instead to admit that it had suffered
It will at some point have to acknowledge that this proposal in its current form cannot enter into force , and even in revised form it will be required to
The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Gargani , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs , on amending the Decision of 4 June
It must state who the Member of the European Parliament is , what his rights and duties are , and what his immunities are , transforming him from a national delegate to
In essence , the Statute is a fundamental pillar of the process of European integration , and it is not approved in order to govern salaries or the reimbursement of expenses , but
Those who gave prominence to that part of the Statute ‚Äì which I define as of lesser importance and which only serves a demagogic purpose in stirring the emotions
In my opinion , Mr Juncker , the decision that Parliament is about to make in a time of crisis is important , because working towards providing Parliament with a more European function
The European Parliament in June and December played its part by listening to the suggestions of the Council , which the Council , however , after we had adopted them , subsequently withdrew
I should like to mention Mr Lehne , who provided a significant , intelligent and cooperative contribution to the text in question; in December 2003 , he summed it up neatly: ‚Äôwe
have been negotiating now for nearly five years , and we cannot continue any longer in a situation where the Council leads Parliament a dance like a bear with a ring
Members of the European Parliament have to have their own autonomous reference standard , which no longer derives from their Member States of origin but from their being representatives of the
The text that we have approved within the Committee on Legal Affairs takes account of the umpteen suggestions of the Council and represents an important balancing point , Mr President , on
Once again , we Members have been ready to pay a price in order to have the Statute and I have to say that that is also true for the
So , although we have accepted all of the Council‚Äôs requests , the Luxembourg Presidency has still expressed some doubts , and opposes a recital ‚Äì number 12 ‚Äì that I proposed and
that the Committee approved , a recital enabling the Member States to lay down supplementary measures in order to make the status of the Members of the European Parliament equal to
If some countries are allowed to nationalise the system , effectively reducing our salary , why cannot others supplement it instead or give us the facilities that they provide to members
Why is it so difficult to understand , ladies and gentlemen , that the Statute provides the legal basis ‚Äì and this is important ‚Äì for allowing the Member States to provide
By sending a personal letter and by failing to consult the Council , the Luxembourg Presidency ‚Äì I have to say ‚Äì has reacted hastily to this amendment , stating that
If the Presidency had not wasted time criticising Parliament or finding specious , trumped-up obstacles , and had lavished more energy on preventing the failure of the Council , it would perhaps
It is now seeking to take home at least one positive result , by promoting the announcement of this Statute , which I believe is an important moment in the life
I am sure that the Council will not reject the Statute on the grounds of this amendment , the content of which lays down a possibility that the Council itself formally
The exchange of letters between the President of Parliament and the President-in-Office of the Council carries strong weight at a political level , but not for the Court of Justice:
therefore , if they are accepted politically , why not lay it down in the Statute , unless there is a reservation in the minds of some people who I hope do not
Significant cooperation has taken place among all of the Members , and it is a balanced text , which will enter into force in 2009 , which leaves adequate transition periods to
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , for 15 years a statute for Members of the European Parliament has been under discussion and , as you know , many initiatives have been taken ,
The process then came to a standstill , and it was under the Italian presidency that Mr Rothley presented a new draft report to Parliament , a draft that also seemed
In November 2004 , in his address to the European Council , President Josep Borrell ‚Äì you yourself , Mr President ‚Äì signalled that the European Parliament was willing to be flexible in
He also emphasised to the European Council that Parliament could not formally present a new proposal without being assured that it would be accepted by the Council and that
At the end of 2004 , under the Dutch Presidency , these consultations took place in the presence of representatives of the future Luxembourg Presidency , and it was agreed that efforts
On 12 January 2005 , the President-in-Office of the Council , in his speech presenting the programme of the Luxembourg Presidency to the European Parliament , confirmed the Presidency‚Äôs intention of ensuring ,
That is why today and tomorrow , when the vote takes place , could be decisive , given that the Council and the European Parliament seem to be able to proceed at
Let me pay special tribute to the efforts of Mr Gargani , rapporteur and chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs , and to the members of that committee , who have managed ,
Had we known then what we know now , we should have left the matter of the financial perspectives to the next Presidency in order to focus more sharply on
I am particularly grateful to you , Mr President , and to your office and your Secretariat for your combined efforts and for the continuous formal and informal dialogue with our
May I also thank all the other Members of Parliament who have patiently , and sometimes discreetly , helped us to work on this difficult and sensitive issue , which is always
The Council , for its part , has kept its promise by trying to establish a consensus on a number of elements that might be the key to agreement on the draft
In a letter of 6 June to your President , I enumerated these elements , foremost among which are remuneration , the principle of reimbursing travel and staff expenses on the basis
I believe that the draft on which we are preparing to take a decision is conducive to greater transparency , an ever-present demand in all of your deliberations and in
In a letter of 16 June , I expressed my satisfaction to President Borrell at the overwhelming vote of approval delivered by the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs on
I also indicated that the amendments adopted by the committee were acceptable to the presidency , with the exception of the clause included in the final report , in recital 12
There is nothing , absolutely nothing , to prevent a government from paying a supplement or allowance ‚Äì call it what you will ‚Äì to its MEPs to put them on
We have exchanged correspondence , which , I believe , has a certain political value and which is based on a sort of code of confidence between the presidencies of the Council
It would be wrong to give the impression , in adopting a Community instrument , an act of the European Union , of creating a European statute while paving the way at
As far as procedure is concerned , once the report drafted by the committee chairman , Mr Gargani , has been approved by you along with the resolution and decision , the adopted documents
I believe that , in doing this , in adopting this statute , we shall also be ending a situation that is completely incomprehensible to the public at large as well as
As you said , Mr President , we shall be enhancing the credibility of the European Union , the credibility of your Parliament and its Members‚Äô Statute and also of the Council ,
I believe that the Presidency has displayed commitment ‚Äì not always enough , perhaps; I accept that criticism ‚Äì but what we want to do today is to make that
Lastly , as regards the question raised by Mr Gargani about the privileges and immunities of Members of the European Parliament , we attach considerable importance to that point , and we fully
The Council agrees that a clear declaration on that subject should be adopted , and we hope that we shall be able to resolve the question of privileges and immunities
First , we pointed out that the provisions in the draft statute relating to the privileges and immunities of Members and governed by primary law could not be amended in
Mr President , I have to admit that , as recently as a couple of weeks ago , I did not believe we would ever get as close as this to
If anyone in particular is to be thanked for this unexpected turn of events , it is the Luxembourg presidency , although I can well imagine that it would have preferred
Our being so close to having the Statute owes much to our former fellow Member and rapporteur Willy Rothley‚Äôs dedication , to which I would like to pay tribute , and
Quite apart from anything prior to that date , it was the introduction , in 1979 , of direct elections to the European Parliament , and the progressive improvement of its rights and prerogatives
as the joint legislator for the EU , and its budgetary authority , that made it wholly inappropriate and improper that the rights of its Members should be subject to national law
As is well known , one consequence of that is that we , Members of a single Parliament , are now subject to 25 different national systems of regulations , which makes a
All these things give us at least three good reasons why any Members‚Äô Statute is better than none , but there is no doubt that what we now have before
It adds up to a balanced and respectable proposal , and one that resolves the presenting problems to which I have already referred , although we have to take on board
Along with others , I personally would have liked certain arrangements to be different; I would , for example , have liked to see higher gross pay and to have us making our
If we want to have a Statute , then this is the only one we are going to get , and it is for that reason that my Group is going
We have asked for a split vote on it , and my Group will be voting against Recital 12 , even though we do not want the Statute to be brought
We also have a problem with the amendment to Article 23 , as adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs , to the effect that the European Parliament , being a European institution ,
I think it would be inappropriate for an entity such as the European Parliament to make payments in anything other than the euro , and this would also entail numerous
I would like to reiterate my warmest thanks to all those who have played a part in this , while also pointing out , for the sake of fairness , that we want
It is only fair and right , if we MEPs are to at last have one set of rules for all , that there should also be one to put the
This is not to make the one dependent on the other , but we who are Members of this House should do everything in our power to offer our staff
This must be the best chance we have ever had and , on behalf of the ALDE Group , I would like to thank the Luxembourg presidency and you for getting
Of course it is a compromise , but it is an important compromise for two reasons: equal pay for equal work ‚Äì and that means equal; fair treatment for all our
Of course we want a better language regime in this House; of course we want a statute for assistants; of course we want the pension fund sorted out; of
When the debate on the Members‚Äô Statute began , it was extremely noble: people talked about immunity , status , and it was a means by which to underline the existence of
Then everything went wrong: it has become a debate on money and various acts of pettiness , which is highly complicated by national exceptions that have partly drained away the European
That said , tomorrow my group will be equally divided between those abstaining and those voting in favour , because there are a number of elements of this Statute about which we
We believe that we are citizens like everyone else , and that it is therefore entirely justifiable that , when you are entitled to a pension , you have in some way
The final comment that I should like to make is the fact that in recent years certainly not only the Luxembourg Government , but also the Council as a whole , has
complicated the situation and made it much more difficult , partly because it has introduced a new concept of , let us say , enlarged assent , by which people are not limited to
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , although there is unanimity within my group on the need for a Members‚Äô Statute , there are also ‚Äì as of course in any
Our demand ‚Äì backed up by amendments to the Rothley report ‚Äì had always been that the amount reimbursed in respect of travel costs should correspond to the expenses actually
Turning to the pension fund , there are differences of opinion among us concerning the proportion of the MEP‚Äôs share in contributions as opposed to the share payable by Parliament , but
we do , in any case , endorse the basic principle according to which Members of this House ‚Äì in the same way as other citizens ‚Äì must contribute to the social
In our debates , we should never lose sight of the fact that one reason why MEPs need to make contributions is that it is the taxpayer who pays our
It is unacceptable that the incomes of MEPs from different countries should differ by as much as EUR 11 000 , and that is why it is right that a
If the Member States go further and decide that they want also to levy the difference between the European and national tax rate , then they are perfectly entitled to do
Mr President , the Swedish June List believes that Members of the European Parliament should receive their salaries from their respective national parliaments and receive uniform remuneration
It would not be fair if a Member of the European Parliament from a country in which salaries are low were to receive a salary several times higher than that
One consequence of a common Statute for Members of the European Parliament might , for example , be that one country‚Äôs MEPs received salaries several times higher than those of their
It is important for Members of the European Parliament not to be regarded as a privileged elite by voters in their own countries , but for salary conditions to be
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I will not keep to the speech that I had prepared and I apologise for that , but the speech made by Mr Schmit forces
The Member has an allowance and therefore a sense of dignity , and if we want to give that back to Parliament , we are the first ones obliged to respect
I ask Mr Schmit whether there is a principle of equality by which , a five-star hotel room in one of the new Member States costs the equivalent of EUR
40 , as was our experience two weeks‚Äô ago in Krakow , Poland , whilst it costs the equivalent of EUR 500 or EUR 700 for a hotel of the same standard in
Whilst you can dine out on EUR 10 in a restaurant in one of the countries of the East , a restaurant of the same quality in Italy , Germany or
From a legal point of view , I believe that it is unacceptable , partly because the interpretation that we are going to give ‚Äì and I am only talking about
Being elected by an Italian electorate of 15 million voters , as I was , is not the same as becoming a Member in an ordered list , produced by the parties
Mr President , this is without a doubt an epoch-making moment in the history of this House , for this debate and vote are , strictly speaking , illicit , and
I predict that what the overwhelming majority of this House‚Äôs Members have accomplished today , and will no doubt finalise tomorrow , will go down in history as the final nail
Its end result is that a people‚Äôs Chamber becomes so detached from reality that many view from a great height the real problems that afflict Europe ‚Äì be they
It was six years ago that I came to this House , a convinced supporter of the EU and lead candidate of the same party that provides with our President , who
I believed that we would be able to escape the trap of globalisation and make the European dream a reality; instead I have had to spend those six years
You will allow me to do this , because an objective that I consider to be of great political value , as a demonstration of the progress we are making towards
That is one of the reasons why I will vote with conviction in favour of those ideas: the principle of non-discrimination cannot be sustained , however , even on the assessments
Presenting the fact that the salary and allowance regime is different from that of national MPs as a privilege , while disregarding the fact that that was the one single
condition preventing a Member of the European Parliament from being considered to carry out a hierarchically subordinate role to that of a member of a national parliament , is not , in
I therefore believe that the transparency introduced by this statute is understood by the public , because people do not understand how anyone buying a flight ticket can be reimbursed ten
I am satisfied with a debate that has , to all intents and purposes , celebrated the work that we do ‚Äì which pleases me ‚Äì and that I believe has
I have the pleasure of thanking the Presidency of Parliament for the assistance it has provided , and Mr Schmit for his commitment to the first part of the Statute , which ,
with another itinerary and with another procedure , must be approved by the Council , and furthermore for his readiness , even in the final hours between this evening and tomorrow , to find
The Luxembourg Presidency has had the courage to face the problem and to dedicate a lot of time , energy and good sense to it , aware that this is a compromise
It is because the Members‚Äô Statute makes it possible to do away with many grey areas and inadequate rules and regulations that I see continued opposition to this compromise
European regulations enable the public to get a better insight than do 25 or 27 sets of national rules and any number of compensation arrangements , some permitted and some
Although our amendment ‚Äì No 1 ‚Äì on this has now been lost , I am convinced that an opening still exists to find a solution at a lower level
I would call on the Members of this House , on the British Government and on all people of conscience to remember the crimes that were committed , and not to turn
I would therefore call on the President of Parliament to take action as quickly as possible , and to ensure that the British Government is called to account on this
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , following on from my last speech before the House in Strasbourg , I should like to reiterate my views on the transport
Subsidies for live cattle exports are and always will be nothing short of scandalous , particularly since , in the majority of cases , they benefit either agribusiness or distributors and wholesale
I should like to point out that it is often enough to change cost structures in certain sectors to minimise various practices or to put a stop to them
I would ask the House to take this into account during the debate on the infrastructure pricing directive , as this would be one opportunity for us to take legislative
I should like , once again , to ask the Commission and the Council to initiate a reform of this system , on the one hand in order to put an end to
I extend congratulations and heartfelt thanks to all of those involved in the status campaign to achieve the status of official working language of the European Union for the
I ask the President of the Parliament to convey to the Council our satisfaction in this matter and would ask also that everything possible be done between now and
1 January 2007 to meet the needs that arise from this new status , and to ensure that the European Parliament and the other EU institutions will be able to provide
By way of contrast , the report makes no mention of the anti-Polish sentiments that are frequently expressed , in particular in those media outlets that have been bought out by
After a clear signal from the European Parliament , when we approved B√∂ge‚Äôs report on the financial perspective by a large majority , we waited anxiously for the result of the
It happened in spite of the will of the poorer EU10 , which were willing to accept a compromise even at the cost of losses for the sake of reaching
With the unsuccessful referenda on the Constitutional Treaty and the budget fiasco at the June summit we have , unfortunately , started to build a new European wall between the old and
Mr President , in the north of the Netherlands province of Limburg , the environmental standards are already being exceeded considerably on account of such things as location
‚Äì Œ§he next item is the debate on the report by Michael Cashman , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , on the
proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (COM(2004)0391 ‚Äì C6-0080/2004 ‚Äì
I believe that the regulation we are discussing this evening , which reflects an agreement at the first reading between Parliament and the Council , is a good signal to send
In other words , we have achieved this objective in something like record time , because the recasting undertaken in the framework of this regulation is designed , on the one hand ,
to remove obsolete provisions from the handbook and , on the other hand , to develop and clarify other provisions on the basis of an analysis of the everyday problems encountered on
The regulation , however , goes further than a mere makeover , because it establishes a veritable Community Code governing the movement of persons across borders , not only relating to the external borders
Moreover , the regulation resolves the problem of the ambiguous legal basis of the handbook by creating a proper legal instrument containing all the basic principles and rules relating to
The internal-border component reiterates the provisions of the Schengen Convention on the abolition of checks on persons at internal borders and on procedures for the temporary reintroduction of such checks
As far as the external borders are concerned , the basic principles governing checks at these borders as enshrined in the Schengen Convention and some parts of the common handbook have
At the meeting of Coreper on 1 June , a general agreement was reached on the wording of the Code and then , on 13 June , the Committee on Civil Liberties ,
For this reason , its adoption at the first reading is extremely important as a means of establishing , on the one hand , a relationship of mutual trust between Parliament and
It also demonstrates that codecision is by no means a hindrance to rapid progress but , on the contrary , serves to hasten progress and promote efficiency and , most importantly , that
The Presidency wishes to thank Parliament , and especially your rapporteur , Mr Cashman , for having worked with the Presidency and the Council in a spirit of openness and transparency but also
It is , in fact , thanks to the amendments tabled by Parliament that the Community Border Code guarantees more transparency and greater protection for citizens of the European Union and
We undoubtedly have considerable difficulties , huge difficulties , but I believe that the act we are discussing this evening in preparation for its adoption at first reading tomorrow shows that
I believe that is the crux of the matter because , in a field that concerns people first and foremost , codecision has finally been given its place , thanks to today‚Äôs
The Presidency also wishes to thank the Commission for its efforts and for its input , throughout the legislative process , of valuable technical knowledge without which the Code would never have
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I too am pleased to be able to state this evening , as Mr Schmit has just said , that we are achieving a genuinely positive
example of institutional cooperation between Parliament , the Council and the Commission , and that we are doing so by means of an instrument , the codecision process , that is having its first
The Luxembourg Presidency rightly sought to make a commitment ‚Äì and the Commission has always supported that commitment ‚Äì to being able to put a balanced provision to the
This provision has many merits , and it is difficult to point them out in a very few minutes: the first is the balance achieved between the need to confirm the
I am referring to the principle of reintroducing internal border controls for obvious reasons of policing , effectively for reasons of security: it was an extremely sensitive subject , and any
That is another sign , which I believe is important , of how the European Commission can offer a constant and ‚Äì I am certain of this and I will obviously strive
Security and freedom are two pillars of the European Union , and there is a good balance in this provision: I would say it is an exemplary case to point
Mr President , it has been a real privilege to work on this dossier , primarily because when we began people told us we would not complete it under the Austrian
So , codecision does not have to be slow , but it has to be thorough and it has to be built on absolute mutual respect for each of the parties
More importantly , I would like to thank those people who sit behind us ‚Äì sometimes seen , sometimes unseen: our assistants and our advisers , without whom we could not do
We have reinforced the role of the Commission , but again I wish we could have done more in relation to spot checks on the application of the Schengen ,
On non-discrimination akin to Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam , for example , there is the right of people undergoing second line checks to have those checks conducted with
On refusal of entry , there will be clearer explanations of the justification of that refusal and the right of appeal once the appellant has returned to their country of
We have reinforced and upheld the principle of freedom of movement for EU citizens and others with a right to reside which , in a Eurobarometer poll , was seen as
Also , very importantly , there is the declaration by the Council and the Parliament on the issue of stateless citizens which states that ‚Äòthe European Parliament and the Council request
the Commission to bring forward proposals , in the framework of the revision of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 , in order to exempt holders of aliens‚Äô and non-citizens‚Äô passports residing in a
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in my capacity of draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development , I should first like to congratulate Mr Cashman on the fine
His report supplements and includes a large number of the observations that I had set out in my opinion on this important topic drafted on behalf of the Committee
I should also like to highlight the political value of the fact , which in my opinion is very positive , that for the first time the Members of the European Parliament
Among the numerous opportunities that would be lost if the process of ratifying the European Constitution foundered , following the ‚Äòno‚Äô votes in France and the Netherlands , would also be
The equation is not easy , but an effort is required in order to achieve a balance between the need for security for our countries , which has to be upheld
It is therefore right to implement the necessary controls at border crossings in order to regulate the influx of those seeking visas and asylum , but we cannot , however , avoid
The citizens of third countries have to be thoroughly informed about the immigration rules and about the control methods; the criteria for refusing access have to be objective and verifiable ,
Strict controls based on a clear set of rules and respect for the rights of the individual: Community action in this delicate area must be based on this inseparable
The rapporteur , at one point , believed that a modification should be proposed , specifically the derogation of Article 22 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement , and presented Amendments 85
In accordance with Article 22 of the Convention , foreigners should declare their entry to the competent authorities , either on entry or within three working days of entry , and the
The Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs raised the issue with the Committee on Legal Affairs and , having studied it , the latter came to the conclusion that that
proposed amendment would make it necessary to review the legal basis and that Article 62(1) and Article 62(2) would not be sufficient , but that Article 62(3) of the Treaty would
also be necessary , since Article 62(3) of the Treaty refers to the conditions in which third-country nationals can travel freely in the territory of the Member States for a period
The rapporteur subsequently reached an agreement with the Committee in this regard and did not consider it necessary to continue with his amendment , and it is not therefore now
In any event , perhaps the only value of this work is that we know that , in the case of the reference to the Schengen Agreements , not only will the
This is the first real opportunity for this Parliament to deal with the issue in its entirety , keeping in mind the fact that the proposal has been transferred from the
This complex and substantial proposal has two main objectives: firstly , to consolidate the rules in force on the crossing of external borders , as laid down in the Schengen framework; secondly ,
The proposal is broken down into four titles: the first contains general provisions; the second regulates the crossing of external borders and conditions for entry in the Schengen area; the
third deals with internal borders , reaffirming the abolition of all border controls and stipulating the cases and the procedures in which such controls can be reintroduced; and the fourth contains
All of that will be highly beneficial when the code on the crossing of borders definitively enters into force and becomes an item of everyday reference for the border
He has , moreover , taken part in lengthy negotiations with the Council , with the Luxembourg Presidency , and it is therefore desirable that the report is put to the vote during
The compromise that has been reached with the various political groups , with the agreement of the Council and the Commission , has been put to the vote and unanimously approved by
I personally made sure before the vote in committee that Vice-President Frattini‚Äôs office was also in favour of the report , and I also received confirmation of this from the
Precisely as a result of this general consensus , which was reached by means of a complex series of bilateral and multilateral compromises , the report should not be subjected to changes
Having followed its development and having thoroughly established that no problem exists , I personally , as shadow rapporteur , propose that , through our vote , we give our full support to the
Because asylum , refugee policy and immigration are issues to which we in the committee devote a lot of time , it was necessary initially to obtain clear rules on the
Criminals , drug traffickers and human traffickers who import women and children for the purposes of prostitution will have fewer opportunities to move freely across borders , while other people , despite
We want of course to see a more open EU , but that requires common solutions and respect for countries , as well as respect between countries and between people and
Mr President , it is not mere courtesy that compels me to begin by offering my congratulations to the two architects of the achievement ‚Äì and I use the term
The first was that , while guaranteeing the rights of the beneficiaries of freedom of movement under Community law , the instrument must also keep open the option of conducting the
The agreement reached on this point , which is reflected in the wording of Article 6(2) , corresponds very precisely to the spirit of the amendment I had tabled myself but
It seemed to me ‚Äì and this was my second concern ‚Äì that , in cases where nationals of non-EU countries were refused entry to the territory of the Union , their
The provision that is set out today in Article 11(13) is a good provision , and I am delighted about that ‚Äì just as I am delighted , Mr President , by
Mr President , as shadow rapporteur for my group , I should like to extend sincere thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Cashman , to all of my counterparts from the other
A citizen of a third country wishing to enter the EU , and holding a visa to do so , could be refused entry if he was unable to produce all
It is hardly likely that the person in question would then have been able to travel to the USA , Canada or Australia with a stamp of this kind in
The most important consequence of this is that all stamps indicating refusal of entry into the EU will be corrected in cases where entry has been refused for no
Mr President , as the final Member speaking in this debate can I emphasise that I was not a shadow , but I have learned a great deal
from the way Mr Cashman has achieved agreement on the most difficult of subjects , dealing with sensitive issues like the reintroduction of border checks , creating a balance between security post-9/11
It is also a great success because Members like me have observed that reaching a compromise between security at border control on the one hand , and fairness on the other ,
Therefore I commend in this report ‚Äì the first time in a codecision report since the Article 13 directives went through this Parliament ‚Äì the fact that we have
The first of these is the excellent cooperation on the part of both the committees that have delivered opinions , namely the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy and the
Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , and on the part of the vast majority of political groups , in particular the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , the Group
of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , the Group of the European People‚Äôs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats , the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the
The European Security Strategy states that there are currently a great many new threats and challenges to our security , the most significant of which include the proliferation of weapons of
It is a fact of life that the kind of terrorism to which Europe grew accustomed in the 1960s and 1970s has been replaced by a new kind of
The result of this is that EU Member States are not in a position to close the technology gap that exists between the United States and Europe in terms
Accordingly , in response to this need for more effective security research , the Commission has proposed a European Security Research Programme , due to be launched in two years‚Äô time under the
What is more , Parliament‚Äôs adoption of the Programme , the proposed annual budget for which is EUR 1 billion in addition to any research funding already earmarked for this sector
They include the fields of C4ISR systems , or in other words command , control , communications , computing , intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance , and also research in the field of biotechnology and space
I have to say , and it gives me great satisfaction to do so , that this would appear to be the key contribution made by Parliament to the Commission‚Äôs proposal ,
Given that defence-related issues are at the top of the political agenda , there is every likelihood that this Programme will enable us to increase security and make it easier to
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss security research with the House today , and I should like to express my thanks
Research at both national and European level is required to create such a base , and it was for this reason that the Group of Personalities made the following recommendation
Firstly , this research must actively help to create a social and business environment which is conducive to positive economic development and which lays the groundwork for prosperity , as this
It must also enhance the competitiveness of the European security industry , and in fact the European Security Research Programme will help create and extend a European market for security
Although research of this kind falls within the remit of the European Defence Agency , those working in the field of civil security research maintain close contacts with the latter in
Finally , there is no escaping the fact that security research is a particularly sensitive sector with very specific requirements , which include intellectual property rights , the spread of information , cooperation
Security research under the Seventh Framework Programme will focus on the following areas; protection against terrorism and crime , security of infrastructures and utilities , border protection and restoring security in case
The European Security Research Advisory Board will play a leading role in helping to develop a longer-term vision , as it will act as a forum where users and the Commission
As proposed in the report on security research , and in order to ensure that Parliament is properly represented , Vice-President Verheugen has invited five committees to appoint representatives to act
It is for this reason that we welcome the report upon which this House will vote , and which was drafted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs together with the
I should also like to thank Parliament for giving its consent to security research in general during the debate on the Seventh Framework Programme , and in particular with regard
The Commission will be happy to continue submitting reports on the implementation of the Preparatory Action until such a time as implementation of the European Security Research Programme becomes possible
This will allow us to take action at Community level that enhances the competitiveness of the security industry , allows us to progress towards the Lisbon goals and helps our
Our contribution fundamentally consists of setting objectives optimising resources , clarifying responsibilities , classifying security research as of public interest ‚Äî a fundamental and extremely important issue ‚Äî providing great impetus , by
means of research , for interoperability , which is so necessary in crisis situations , not so much in terms of prevention but in terms of response to and resolution of those crises ,
and advocating the need for adequate funding , linking security research entirely to gross domestic product , hence taking account of the economic weight of States and not allowing research in this
By means of these research formulae , we are going to improve one of our greatest weaknesses , the so-called C4ISR ‚Äî control , intelligence and monitoring systems ‚Äî and it can
When we attempt to formulate and define a policy of common security research , this does not involve irrational fears or ideology , but a very rational policy that will enable
In this light I would like to express great concern at the potentially fatal consequences that might be suffered by the area of security research if there is no suitable
If the Council does not follow the guidelines of Parliament and the original proposal from the Commission , there is a serious fear of the termination of new programmes that
The Kok report has already set out the clear finding that responsibility for achieving the Lisbon objectives lies first and foremost with the Member States , both in decision-making at home
I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to give their determined support in the negotiations on the financial perspective to mechanisms that will enable the achieving of
Both the European Council , with the European security strategy adopted in December 2003 , and the European Parliament , in its resolution in April 2005 , have highlighted the need to combat international
However , it is true that , when investment by the United States is compared with investment by the European Union in internal security and even in the arms industry and
The European Union must move forward , because it has every interest in avoiding dependence and , at the same time , securing its interests , the interests of the Member States and the
It is also in its interest for the European Union to strengthen research programmes and policies and to contribute to economic development , to the strengthening of competitiveness and to the
The proposal to integrate this programme into the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union is particularly important , as is the proposal to give it an annual budget of
If they are to be combated effectively , the problems of international terrorism , organised crime and illegal immigration need a broader approach , not for research to be encaged in a
Finally , I believe that we need to ensure , as the European Union , that security research does not undermine our collective principles and values about the protection of human rights and
In order to deal with terrorists , we have made our life difficult and , at the same time , we demean the life of citizens: body searches , microphones , cameras; none of this
As a result , opium went up in Afghanistan , the opium which is killing our children , including many in Greece , while in Iran oil went up from USD 20 to
So let us tell him that he owes us much more than he gives us , because the price of oil has risen from USD 20 to 60 a barrel ,
The second phase , which will take place in Tunis this November , will focus on the implementation of the plan and on two unresolved issues , namely financing the plan of
It is an essential means of reducing inequality and promoting human dignity as well as of guaranteeing freedom of expression and information , pluralism of opinion and popular involvement in
The concern of the World Summit to ensure that a better regulatory framework , an appropriate system of governance , is created to avert the risks and aberrations that might jeopardise
The European Union did not want a new fund to be created at the United Nations for the purpose of encouraging cooperative ventures , since it would entail the mobilisation
People using ICT should be involved as users and players , thereby helping to ensure that ICT-based services promote the quality of life , the development of entrepreneurial activity and the
It is for this reason that I should like the timetables for the Lisbon and i2010 strategies to be linked to the plan of action and the involvement of
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that this report on the information society , dealing with the UN World Summit in Tunis in November , is a useful and timely
It confirms the interest you have already shown in this summit , both through the participation of several Members of Parliament in the Geneva session in December 2003 and through
This is no coincidence , for the vision of the information society adopted by the international community in the UN framework is in line with European thinking , which extends beyond
I should therefore like to emphasise our concordance of views with the analysis presented by Mrs Trautmann and to tell you how much the Commission appreciates the work that
Indeed , the report clearly identifies the main issues of the summit , namely the development dimension and the importance of the social component of the digital divide , the role of
In this context , I should like to inform you that , on 2 June of this year , the Commission adopted a communication which lays the foundations of the European position for
What we expect from Tunis may be summed up as follows: confirmation of the Geneva declaration on an inclusive information society respecting human rights , freedom of expression and cultural and
linguistic diversity; a summit focused on action and devoting its attention to a limited number of priorities; an agreement on financing which will result in higher priority being attached to
The Internet has become an essential resource for all countries; for this reason , we should be committed to a more international form of governance of the Internet , the practicalities of
A new model of cooperation is needed in order to translate into practice the provisions of the declaration of principles adopted at the Geneva summit relating to the crucial
For my part , I have taken every available opportunity to express the view that the host country of a summit must be irreproachable in its adherence to the principles
I also attach great importance to the full participation of NGOs at the Tunis summit , and I should like to say to Mrs Trautmann that I shall , if at
With a view to the second phase of the World Summit on the Information Society , that will take place in Tunisia in November , and also in view of the Millennium
Objectives of the United Nations and the Lisbon Strategy , the rapporteur has included all the considerations relating to information and communication technologies and the information society , from an economic point
In the field that concerns me in particular , the cultural field , the report has incorporated the suggestions of this Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education: it states that the information
society must be open to everybody and education , training and digital literacy are priority fields in terms of creating an inclusive information society which helps to overcome digital fragmentation and
guarantees access to basic technologies under equal conditions , and also helps the citizens to participate in political decision-making , with a view to strengthening democracy , though always moving in the direction
It also indicates that , as well as presenting risks , the information society also offers an opportunity to promote intercultural dialogue and to guarantee freedom of expression and information , cultural diversity
Genuine political will is expressed through commitments and , as the Commission also indicated in its Communication on ‚Äòi2010 ‚Äì A European Information Society for growth and employment‚Äô , the information
It is therefore urgent that we organise a debate at European level , together with the governments of the Member States , and consider how we are going to achieve the
Unless we leave aside exclusively State interests , leave aside the focus on the ‚Äòme‚Äô and think of ‚Äòus‚Äô , in Europe , our political will will be called seriously into question , if
Mr President , the Group of the European People‚Äôs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats sets great store by this House‚Äôs active involvement in the second world summit on
Although she managed to organise the dialogue between the groups in a very fruitful and sound manner , she also knows that we have some critical comments to make about
In 2010 , the emphasis is on a competitive and open internal market , on increasing EU investments , information and communication technology and on promoting a universally accessible information society in
We in the PPE-DE Group are very keen that there should be projects at global level to flesh out , and it goes without saying that this means that a financial
Furthermore , I would like to express my perplexity at the possible and imminent extension of software patents , which could represent a very considerable obstacle to access to the Internet , access
Instead , we believe that the European Union‚Äôs support and financial aid should be aimed at promoting free and open software in those countries , which require interoperative systems , as indicated
The information society has to be accessible to all: an element of democracy that takes account of cultural diversities and that promotes the participation of the citizens , who are
The role of public investment is fundamental in order to safeguard the accessible character of information technology , for instance , in ensuring the development of free software and its adoption within
It is a matter of ensuring the representativeness and the legitimacy of the new organisation managing the Internet , by establishing governance with various players: governments , NGOs , private sector , and
By means of the directive on the patenting of software , the right to free movement of knowledge is attacked , challenging the objective of the information society becoming accessible to
The same giant companies now own not only the television , radio and press institutions but also the mobile communications technologies , and this kind of homogeneity presents us with a
Europe has every chance of setting an example to the rest of the world in this field , particularly since the information society plays a leading role in the Lisbon
We must also show them that increases in employment , or in other words in the number of people in work , mean that we can spend more on welfare benefits ,
The digital divide plays a key role in this respect; to take but one example , family businesses in developing countries lack the basics not only in terms of hardware
The Internet is also home to a wealth of cultural and linguistic diversity ‚Äì another example of which can be seen in this House , with its 20 languages ‚Äì
The provision of Internet-based information on health , prevention and awareness of the causes of disease will have a major impact on such spending , and will be most useful in
Commissioner , the Tunisia Summit must demonstrate the political will of the European Union and the Member States to promote information and communication technologies as a strategic instrument for economic and
I am sure that the citizens would support us in this; the last Eurobarometer confirmed this: 71% of Europeans want more emphasis and more resources to be dedicated to
And if we reach an agreement on the new financial perspectives , we in the European Union have the opportunity to take advantage of the priority , already expressed by the
Secondly , with regard to the governance of the Internet and in view of the approaching conclusion of the ICANN , a new model must be created that is based on an
international organisation and in which political decisions are reserved for governments and technical tasks for the industry and the private sector , undoubtedly with a flexible operation that reconciles decision making
That model , ladies and gentlemen , must also ensure the participation of civil society , through the creation of a discussion forum to respond to the challenges and problems raised by the
Mr President , I hope you will not think me a kill-joy at this late hour , but I would like to touch on something negative relating to
The Trautmann report is undoubtedly correct when it asserts that ICT development must serve to strengthen democracy and citizens‚Äô interests , so as to make people participants and not simply
In these Member States , development of the services sector and infrastructure could easily become asymmetrical as a result , since a significant portion of society , lacking the appropriate motivation , is
I am confident that the report has taken a step in this direction and so I support it , and of course I too congratulate Mrs Trautmann and thank her
Alongside the fact that they increase productivity and promote inclusion in society , this transition to the age of digital communication is also a cause of exclusion from society , especially if
It is therefore extremely important that we invest in the development of the information society , and at the same time in education for the use of modern technology even
Given that we perform an increasing number of services by modern means and a declining number on paper , there is the possibility of discrimination emerging owing to a lack of
Equally important is that great attention should be paid to the security of using modern technology and communication , and that trust will grow through development and the possibility of misuse
Mr President , it was developments in information technology that broke the monopoly of Communist censorship in the 1980s , and helped bring democracy to our
The next challenge awaiting us is the development of an information society , in which technology and communications are used to enforce human rights standards effectively at international , national and
By this I mean firstly primary education , in order to ensure that no one feels scared of technological progress , and secondly education on media content , which would allow young
The Belarussian Government is also well aware of the potential role of the Internet in developing civil society and democracy , and it uses every means at its disposal to curb
A further characteristic feature of the situation in Belarus is the fact that the state is the only Internet provider , as there are no other operators in the country
The Belarussian Ministry of Communications requires all Internet users to obtain authorisation for their modems at a cost of USD 20 , even though the average monthly income per capita
Mr President , I must apologise to the Commissioner because , as she probably knows , I do not normally make a practice of turning up just in time
I am pleased to be here to support Mrs Trautmann‚Äôs report , particularly because I was part of the delegation that went to the first World Summit on the Information
I can tell colleagues from that experience that it is quite clear how respected the European Union has been and continues to be within the whole process of developing the
I cannot overstate the importance of that , particularly because we want those computer scientists to develop the tools , products , services and new ideas that will help their communities , whether
Secondly , there is the importance of encouraging them to have a competitive infrastructure for telecommunications , to bring those costs down , to encourage competition so they can have the same access
‚Äì Œ§he next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Marcin Libicki , on behalf of the Committee on Petitions , on the Lloyd's
‚Äì Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Chairman of the Committee on Petitions , Mr Libicki , has asked me to state the following on his behalf , due to his
The debate this evening , moved by the oral question tabled on behalf of the Committee on Petitions , touches the very core that many people have in mind when they talk
Every citizen has the right to petition Parliament within the framework of the activities of the European Union and to expect a satisfactory response; to expect that , where there
If a European law has not been applied correctly by a Member State for a great many years; if , indeed , incorrect application has also resulted in serious personal losses and ,
in certain cases , pushed people to the point at which they end their lives; if it is true that the petitioners in the Lloyd's affair in the United Kingdom , Ireland ,
Germany and numerous other countries in the European Union suffered huge financial losses because the First Non-Life Insurance Directive was not applied correctly , then this matter must make all of
Long and detailed enquiries followed by the Committee on Petitions and yet , despite all this , the petitioners are still waiting for a clear answer to the questions raised in
If the European Parliament needs to refer the European Commission to the Court of Justice of the European Communities , because it failed to reply to our question and because it
The question at issue is a question of the European Commission's rendering proper account to the European Parliament and , consequently of the European Parliament's rendering proper account to the citizens ,
The European Parliament is waiting for the European Commission to decide if European citizens have rights and to investigate if the United Kingdom has applied the laws on the proper
The Commission‚Äôs views and concerns relating to the pre-2000 UK legislation were set out clearly in its letter of formal notice of December 2001 , which is now a public
The Commission has no doubt that once it had established the compatibility of the new regime for Lloyd‚Äôs it had no basis for continuing the infringement proceedings it had begun
In order to help them in their litigation in the UK against the UK Government , the petitioners and many correspondents seem to seek a ruling from the Commission on the
The Commission voiced its concerns in its 2001 letter of formal notice but this was only the first step in a long process of argument and counter-argument that might
The Commission is fully aware that it is a subject of great regret to many that the legal proceedings begun with our letter were not pursued to their ultimate conclusion ,
but it has no doubt that its decision to discontinue the proceedings was the right one and was fully in conformity with the constant jurisprudence of the Court in the
As to the third question in Mr Perry‚Äôs report about possible shortcomings or omissions in the UK regime , I reiterate that the Commission raised a number of questions in its
Mr President , I should say first of all that I come from a Lloyd‚Äôs background , although I am not a Name; I never have been and I have no
But equally I support the principle of this question , which dates back ‚Äì as many colleagues now know ‚Äì to 1997 in terms of the petition and far longer
It is a measure of that concern that there is unanimity in the Committee on Petitions , even though there may be disagreement about the substance on the fact that
That is why there is a motion for a resolution attached to give power to the President of Parliament to instruct the Committee on Legal Affairs to take legal
The cause for concern here is that it is a failure by the Commission to respond to the Committee on Petitions ‚Äì now in total as opposed to an
My colleagues and I on the Committee on Petitions cannot agree to the petition being closed until we get the proper answers to these questions tabled now and also
The Commission must answer the question properly to give at least a chance to those who have suffered at the hands of Lloyd‚Äôs in this sad affair the opportunity to
Mr President , during the last term in office , I was a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and I followed this issue , and then , just as now , I
was highly perplexed , because we are talking here about the Commission‚Äôs legal responsibilities , in accordance with Article 232 of the Treaty , which relates to the procedure on failure to act ,
Of course , this is a Directive that was not adopted by a previous British Government but which was then adopted by a subsequent government , the current government; the Commission began
an infringement procedure pursuant to Article 226 , the situation was changed , the Directive was incorporated and , from that point , as Commissioner McCreevy has pointed out , according to the case-law of
the Court of Justice of the European Union , it was not possible to continue proceedings before the Court , because Article 226 says: ‚ÄòIf the Commission considers that a Member State
That is to say that I have the impression that , as Commissioner McCreevy has said , at this point , the only possibility is to bring an action before the British
In legal terms , we could say that , as things stand , neither this Parliament , nor the Commission , nor the Court of Justice of the European Union are the appropriate fora
We could have a different Treaty , which would impose obligations on the Commission with regard to things that have happened previously , but in this case the case-law of the
That is to say that the Treaty does not authorise the Commission to bring a State before the Court of Justice once the State has conformed to European Union
It is not a mathematical or immediate , or automatic , system , but rather the State must firstly be called upon to comply , and when it does so , the procedure comes
I recommend that the people affected by the Lloyd's case turn to the British courts and take appropriate action in accordance with British Law , but I believe that there is
no point in our considering this procedure at this point; it is a huge waste of time for this Parliament and we could go as far as to say that
Mr President , the Commissioner is of course new to this saga , but unfortunately for many of our constituents , both in the UK and elsewhere , this is a long-running tragedy
If we are honest , and I agree with Mr Medina Ortega about this , we know that whatever we do may not bring a resolution to the many personal cases of
We do not want legal proceedings between our institutions for the sake of having legal proceedings , but we do want to do something that enhances the position and standing
Surely , again in the current political climate , we have a duty to our citizens to get to the bottom of what happens in cases like this and to give
If the European citizens write to us to turn to us for help , and Member States fail , a successful case before the European Court of Justice would enhance Parliament‚Äôs
In that case , I must apply other techniques in an effort to wake this House; to get justice for tens of thousands of European citizens who are terrorised by
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Libicki‚Äôs question rubs salt into the wounds of the contradictions of this Europe , which is tailor-made for large financial interests ,
From examining the documentation , both the breaches of the Commission and those of the British Government , or at least of its so-called supervisory bodies , stand out , but what also stands
The legitimate doubt arises that Directive 73/239/EEC on solvency was disregarded with the conscious acquiescence , not to say complicity , of the European Commission and the competent supervisory bodies of
‚Äô The old saying is also true in terms of the United Kingdom and the European Commission: the fact remains , however , that the business of insurance is a gamble that
There is no sympathy for those who take risks in investing and in financial speculations , because those types of entrepreneur feel no sympathy for small savers , for consumers , for the
extremely high number of victims of their dangerous and unscrupulous financial games , and for those who , on the contrary , make money through the sweat of their brow , investing their physical
Those who gamble on probability , a gamble that clearly yields more profit than forgiveness , given that that activity has been practised for centuries , must also accept the risks; the Lloyd‚Äôs
affair is a symbolic example of the unfair expectations of those who always want to win just because they have large sums of money to risk , not caring less about
Since this is a codecision issue ‚Äì as the insurance directive is a codecision directive ‚Äì Parliament has at least equal right to the information which is available to
I think it is entirely unfair to deny this House the information to which it is entitled , and you face the real risk of being brought before the European
The Commission has acted by deciding to open an infringement procedure and acted again by deciding to close the case when it received a satisfactory answer from the UK
In this case , however , the Commission is being asked to pronounce on whether a Member State was in conformity with Community law during a certain period in the past ,
‚Äì Œ§he next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading by Othmar Karas , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on
the Council common position for adoption of a Council regulation on amending Regulation (ŒïC) No 1466/97 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Juncker , said in his speech this morning that he had brought two principles to the attention
It is a sad state of affairs when the members of a community must be reminded of such self-evident rules of conduct , and when appeals must be made to
Yet , even though the majority of finance ministers , the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council agreed on the substance of our new amendments , not one of them was
Most of the national delegations would have been prepared to incorporate certain amendments , in particular those relating to total debt evolution and monitoring , but a small number of influential
Attempts are now being made to pass the buck to Parliament , by telling us that although no one is going to ask us what we want , we have no
In its statement on the ECOFIN decision , the Commission said that in its opinion , the draft regulation would have been further strengthened had some of Parliament‚Äôs amendments been incorporated ,
This is a sign that Parliament is heading in the right direction , and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has therefore decided to resubmit the amendments adopted at
Our reasons for this are as follows; we are convinced that the substance of these amendments is appropriate , and we do not want the other EU institutions to disregard
The Council has stated that comparisons of this kind are already being carried out , but this begs the question of why no one noticed the discrepancies in the figures
Secondly , we want the medium-term budgetary objectives to be reviewed , and not ‚Äòat least every four years‚Äô , as the Council has now proposed , but on a regular basis , as per
It is hard to escape the conclusion that this is not in fact a dispute over points of substance; the simple truth of the matter is that the Council
Mr President , with the positive vote of the Council common position , the European Parliament can clear the way to a fruitful conclusion on what has been a long , intense
The main aim of the report is to enhance governance and the national ownership of the EU fiscal framework by strengthening its economic underpinning , while safeguarding the sustainability of public
On 20 April 2005 , the earliest possible date following the agreement , the Commission adopted the two proposals amending the two Council Regulations ‚Äì (EC) No 1466/97 and (EC) No 1467/97
I would like to express the Commission‚Äôs gratitude , in particular to the Parliament for its cooperative attitude , thereby making it possible to finalise the amendment procedure during the Luxembourg
Nevertheless , the changes adopted by the Council with respect to the Commission proposal go in the direction of further clarifying the implementation of the preventive part of the Stability
Other changes envisaged by Parliament , namely those in the statistical field , have been considered by the Council in the finalisation of the legal acts directly linked to the statistics
Overall , the revisions made to the Stability and Growth Pact are balanced; they will give the pact a new vigour and provide a better framework for an economically sensible implementation
A cooperative approach to ensure the smooth implementation of the excessive deficit procedure will contribute to the credibility of the renewed framework and of the overall functioning of EMU
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is perhaps symbolic that what may be the last debate before the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact is taking
Be that as it may , I should like to thank Mr Karas for his report , and for his attempt to formulate a position for Parliament that reconciles the views
In my opinion , it says a lot that the Council can reach agreement on a further weakening of the Stability and Growth Pact at a time like this , when
This is all taking place at a time when the euro needs a stable framework and when our key objective should be to avoid running up debts and thereby increasing
I therefore find it equally regrettable that the Commission has given its consent , as this means that nothing has been done about the Pact‚Äôs underlying problem , which is that
The Council should have given its backing to attempts to flesh out somewhat the details of how its own decisions are to be monitored and interpreted , and the Commission
All we can do is encourage them to continue the fight to achieve a solid framework for the euro and for the Pact governing the euro , which is our
Members of the previous Commission were prepared to do just that , and I would encourage you to continue fighting for the Pact and for the spirit that it formerly
His objective with regard to monetary union was twofold: to stabilise exchange rates and the development of inflation , and to bring closer a political Union in which Europe‚Äôs citizens
As far as the second aspect , political Union , is concerned , though , we seem to be further removed from it than ever these days , although crises sometimes give rise to
The Member States that exchanged their national currencies for the common euro without committing to a further political Union and starting one macro-economic and budget policy needed guarantees to prevent
They did not want to encroach too much on each other‚Äôs territory in terms of political choices for budgetary policy , and that is how the Stability and Growth Pact
For example , the European Central Bank was very negative about this corrective aspect but was able to endorse the pact‚Äôs preventive section , while taking into account such factors as
The strange thing is that we have now adopted this regulation on this controversial corrective section , that this only falls within the scope of an advisory procedure and that
In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , a number of amendments to this regulation have therefore been adopted , but , as a qualified majority is required for those amendments to
I would therefore counsel against this , and advise this House to accept the situation as it is , as the Commission was sensible enough to do , for both regulations ‚Äì
Due to lack of time , I would like to touch upon just two of the points contained in the Council‚Äôs comments on Article 6 paragraph 1 and Article 7
With regard to Article 6 paragraph 1 , it is clear that there is a fundamental difference between reporting and monitoring the absolute value of the surplus or deficit in public
finances , and the level of overall public finance debt as a percentage of the preset basis , for example , gross domestic product , which has a substantially higher information value from the
Over and above the position of the European Parliament , I would like to question the wording of Article 7 paragraph 2(a) and how it has been amended by the European
This may only be applied if the costs of pensions reform will demonstrably be addressed at the expense of lower final consumption or increased savings by citizens , and not
Mr President , Commissioner , we are experiencing difficult times in the European Union , difficult times that are characterised by a lack of confidence , which leads to a
At times such as these , when reforms of the Institutions are being carried out , as in the case of the Stability Pact , it is important that all the institutions
of the European Union are present and that they participate in those institutional reforms , in order to give them more credibility and in order to communicate to the European citizens ,
Despite this , however , we have presented constructive initiatives in order to supplement no less than the preventive aspect of the Stability and Growth Pact , and it is therefore absurd
that the Council should dig its heels in and not allow a European Parliament initiative of a constructive nature which is intended to make the Stability Pact more reliable and
I trust that this situation will change , that tomorrow the European Parliament will express its support for these amendments and act consistently and , also , that the intransigence of the Council
The Commissioner , who is here today , is well aware that the budget surplus ‚Äî what a budget surplus you achieved when you were responsible for finance in Ireland , Mr McCreevy
‚Äî is well aware that the quality of public finances makes a contribution to confidence when it comes to promoting economic growth and job creation; that is what the
‚Äì Mr President , I should like to begin by commending Mr Karas , as indeed I did in our debate in Strasbourg a few days ago , on his
far-reaching and well-executed work , even though our positions differ on the most appropriate means of achieving stability in public financing and on the importance of this instrument to the European
The issue before us is whether , on the one hand , we accept a proposal that is to my mind relatively well balanced and thereby succeed in adopting this balanced proposal
before the end of the Luxembourg Presidency , or , on the other hand , we find a way of postponing the process and possibly leading it down a blind alley through a
I therefore feel that , rather than appealing to the Members of this House , who might block the adoption of this common position , our overriding priorities should be common sense
Although this is not a position that I myself welcome , it is clearly a step in the right direction , towards smoothing relations between the EU and the citizens , whose
At a time when the ECB is ready to break free from its orthodoxy , now does not strike me as the right time for Parliament to cling stubbornly to
Mr President , I should like to repeat that in the deliberations of the Council‚Äôs ad hoc group on the Stability and Growth Pact , the Commission actively supported a number

Commission Legislative and Work Programme for 2010 (debate)
The next item is the statement by Mr Barroso , the President of the European Commission , on the Legislative and Work Programme of the Commission for 2010
I would like to stress that a good number of Commissioners are also present in the Chamber
The whole European Commission is strongly represented , because the subject is extremely important for all of us
hear speeches from the chairs of the political groups , who will give a political opinion on what the Commission is proposing for 2010
Then we will ask Mr Barroso to speak again and to respond to the comments of the chairs of the political groups
President Barroso , thank you for coming
It has not been easy for any of us to get to Strasbourg
Many Members have not arrived at the European Parliament , so the attendance is not very high
We decided not to vote during this part-session because everybody must have the opportunity to vote , and some Members could not come to Strasbourg at all
So there are some quite new rules for this part-session
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have the honour and the pleasure of presenting to you today the first work programme of this Commission
It is also the first work programme since the Treaty of Lisbon came into effect
I have the honour and the pleasure of presenting it alongside practically my entire team , the European Commission , as a sign of respect for your Parliament
This programme is being presented at a decisive moment for Europe , since it is now that we must act
This programme is the direct outcome of our political dialogue
After intensive consultations based on the political guidelines that I presented for the next five years , this Parliament entrusted me , in September , with the responsibility of a second mandate
February
In other words , this work programme is very much in line with the political priorities expressed by your institution
This being so , it provides a solid platform for achieving ambitious results
Our very first priority must be to emerge from the crisis and to lay the foundations for sustainable , job-creating growth
First , the urgent issues: we recently debated the results of the European Council
Meanwhile , the proposed financial support mechanism for Greece was finally put in place on 11 April
The Commission will play an important role in the implementation of this mechanism when Greece asks for it to be activated
problems encountered by Greece and in preserving stability within the euro area
Our involvement has always been in line with the principle of solidarity , but also of responsibility
However , we must do more and ask ourselves why these problems have occurred and how they can be prevented in future
That is why we are reviewing the Stability and Growth Pact in order to strengthen economic supervision and to extend it beyond the sole issue of deficits
We need a permanent mechanism for resolving crises
the possibilities offered by the Treaty of Lisbon
That is why one of the Commission's first major initiatives in the coming month will be to present a communication on the increased coordination of economic policies
We all know that the collective interest of Europe is at stake here
The Union must strengthen the system and take into consideration the whole spectrum of risks and economic imbalances
We need to improve internal mechanisms
framework that is conducive to a broader , sustainable recovery
Ladies and gentlemen , in the last 18 months , we have made enormous progress towards putting in place a financial system that is more ethical , robust and responsible
constantly evolving
I am convinced that our proposal on hedge funds and private equity will soon reach a decisive stage
fully operational from the beginning of next year
In 2010 , the Commission intends to present several proposals in key areas , such as the derivatives markets , deposit-guarantee systems and market abuses
The protection of ordinary consumers of financial services will receive special attention
funds for resolving banking failures
Mr President , distinguished Members of Parliament , this Commission hit the ground running
inclusive growth
We now need to work together - European Parliament , Member States , Commission - to build and sustain the momentum
Achieving the vision of a sustainable social market economy by 2020 will require a strong effort from all levels of decision making and all levels of society
At European level , our action must have genuine European added-value
Europe , new skills for new jobs , 'Youth on the move' , fighting social exclusion
This is where Europe can make the difference
Thus , we will help drive the transition to a resource efficient and climate change resilient economy
Fighting climate change will remain a top priority on our agenda , both internally and globally
The energy and transport sectors will get particular attention this year - both critical to turn the challenge of a sustainable Europe into our competitive advantage
The Single Market , as a home market of 500 million consumers underpinning jobs , competitiveness , affordable prices and consumer choice , will continue to constitute the backbone of the European economy
Tapping its full potential is particularly important for small and medium-sized enterprises , which are the most important driver for job creation in the European Union
Bringing the single market into the 21st century is a priority for the Commission , which will make new proposals by 2012
This is also the subject of a report which I have asked Mario Monti to prepare and which we will be presenting very soon
I want to underline the importance of social inclusion in our vision for Europe 2020
The real strength of a society rests on the opportunities it creates for its weakest citizens
We must seize every opportunity to encourage employment and social cohesion
That means being ready to exploit the emerging sectors which will generate new jobs
It means providing people with the right skills to create and sustain high employment levels and facilitate economic transition
It means working to overcome the impact of the crisis on young people by easing transitions from education and training to work
To this end , a broad-ranged European Platform against Poverty will be built on the current European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion
This agenda is , of course , a contribution to the fulfilment of our principles of economic , social and territorial cohesion
The concerns and well-being of European citizens will remain at the heart of Commission action
integration in the area of freedom , security and justice become more tangible to the citizens
This Action Plan represents , on its own , a comprehensive work programme for the Commission in the area of freedom , security and justice
It puts citizens at the core of our policies by facilitating the exercise of their specific rights
It will also aim at developing an open and secure Europe with a particular focus on tackling cross-border crime and on a common immigration and asylum policy
policy
above all , to tap all the potential that is now created by the Lisbon Treaty
The Action Plan contains a comprehensive list of measures to implement our already defined priorities in this field , both at European and global level
The entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty also gives us the tools to demonstrate greater ambition
judicial review by the Court of Justice will strengthen European Union determination in responding to the expectations and concerns of our citizens
When we look to 2020 , we must also address a number of long-term trends with a direct impact on the daily lives of citizens
Action now will pay dividends in the future
For example , the Commission will launch a public debate on the future of pensions and analyse options for ensuring the sustainability and adequacy of the pension systems
maximum contribution
more coherent EU external policy
We will set out strategic trade policy priorities , take forward trade negotiations and work with partners on issues ranging from market access to regulatory framework and global imbalances
We will project our Europe 2020 objectives on the global market place , for example , through the G20
The Commission will also be tackling the challenges of energy geopolitics , in order to ensure safe , secure , sustainable and affordable energy
Another key priority for the Commission is to pursue the international development agenda and propose an EU action plan in the run-up to the 2015 Millennium Development Goals summit
on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) , which aims at the adoption of a Global Action Plan for reaching the MDGs by 2015
We want a Europe that is open and shows in concrete actions its solidarity with the most vulnerable in the world
Finally , as agreed with this Parliament , we will publish the Budget Review during the third semester of this year
the Europe 2020 strategy
In parallel , we will be making more detailed assessments of key areas , including agriculture and cohesion
I can assure you that Parliament will be fully associated at all stages of the budget review
Before finishing , I would like to briefly explain a number of innovations in the work programme
This programme , and future programmes , needs to offer the right framework for the institutions to build a solid consensus on where Europe should concentrate its attention
We therefore need to be more political , and we also need to reflect the multiannual challenge of initiatives of the scale we intend
establish with the European Parliament in this mandate
This programme identifies 34 strategic initiatives that we are committed to putting on the table before the end of December
I am sure you agree that this is an ambitious agenda for the next eight months
At the same time , the programme includes many other initiatives for 2010 and beyond
This indicative list comprises initiatives on which the Commission intends to work over the coming years
Not all of these initiatives will necessarily lead to the submission of concrete proposals
In line with the principles of smart regulation , we need to assess thoroughly which items should go forward , and in which form
The work programme will be reviewed every year to identify new strategic initiatives and adapt the multiannual strand as required
This 'rolling' approach will enhance transparency and predictability for all stakeholders , while preserving the necessary flexibility to react to unforeseen developments
One thing we have learned in recent years is that we should always predict the unpredictable
Recent years have shown that strategic blueprints cannot be cast in stone - they have to adapt to reality on the ground
coming year
citizens the solutions they are looking for
They expect it from us , and we have a duty to work for their prosperity and well-being
Thank you , Mr Barroso , for a comprehensive presentation of the Commission's most important initiatives for the next eight months
I would just like to stress that the strategic partnership of which you spoke is very important to us
words about the necessity for contact between the Commission and Parliament to be as close as possible
Your presence , and the presence of the Commissioners , during this sitting today is the best evidence that the intentions of the Commission agree with the facts
Thank you very much for this
on behalf of the PPE Group
work programme
we are glad that they are all present
the harmonisation of the legislative programme and the budget from being made this year
We have every confidence that this process can be restored in 2011 after overcoming minor difficulties
our policy plans
The European People's Party prepared two lists with regard to the Commission's plans
We sent the details to you even before acceptance
we would like them to do
40% of your legislative proposals for the year had been tabled
If this continues to be the case in the future , then these sorts of debates are pointless
Parliament cannot exercise the right by which it wishes to make an impact on what proposals the Commission should put forward
in which nothing , from start to finish , was true
And what they eventually achieved had nothing whatsoever to do with the final objectives
The other things we ask of the Commission is not to tolerate lies and deception
At the moment , several European countries are in crisis because they concealed the correct data , and lied about the size of the budget deficit
They concealed this information from the others , and yet we are all in the same boat , and such things affect many people
This was the case in Hungary , this was the case in Greece
In such cases , we expect the Commission not to shrink back , but to name and shame such countries decisively , or else there will be much more trouble later
The renowned nineteenth century thinker of the Hungarian age of reform , Count Sz√©chenyi , said that anyone who covers up trouble increases it
So we should not cover it up , but come forward with it , and , on that basis , take the necessary decisive action
The Commission ought to exercise its competence in this regard
Do not misunderstand me
I am not saying that the Commission is to blame for these crises
order to see results
Now let us move on to what the Commission should do
First of all , it should at last take action and decisions , and should develop an ambitious job creation programme
It should place citizens at the centre of our work
Jobs , jobs , jobs must be our guiding principle
Let me start here by saying that naturally , when we address citizens , we need to use a language that they understand
used to assign to prisoners
no one besides us understands - the European citizen security programme
What I mean to say is that the words we use are also an important part of the start of this entire process
We consider it important that small and medium-sized enterprises take an active part in the process of job creation
They would not like it if the 2020 job creation programme was shoved down Parliament's throat
We need a thorough debate here , and not just in this Parliament but in the national parliaments , and the national decision-making authorities must be involved as well
Let us learn from the failure of the Lisbon Programme - yet another name that no one understands
Let us work for the security of our citizens and let us take the steps necessary in this regard
Mr President , just one observation: man does not live by bread alone - strengthening our common values is also important
We expect the Commission to continue those value-based programmes which deal with Communism , with the coexistence of national minorities , and with Europe's common past
The European People's Party will support you , but we will criticise you very severely if you deviate from the original programme
Mr President , Mr Barroso , Commissioners , I would like to thank so many of you for attending today
Unfortunately , I cannot say the same thing about my fellow Members
I am ashamed to say that not all of those who are not here are genuinely not here
They are in Strasbourg , but they are not in the Chamber where they should be
I find that very sad
As we do not have a joint resolution , we will present our individual points to you and you can evaluate them in detail
Mr Barroso , we agree with you that the main issue is competitiveness combined with social security in a sustainable Europe
Of course , our main emphasis must be on continuing to combat poverty and unemployment , which is still rising in some areas or , at the very least , remains unacceptably high
I would like to thank you for mentioning this , as it is something which some Heads of Government seem not to be convinced of
How can we ensure that this happens in an era of budgetary consolidation
It goes without saying that we must consolidate our budgets
to ensure that the other essential objectives , in other words , combating unemployment and poverty , are not left in ruins
but which two members of the Commission attended , Mrs Reding , the Vice-President of the Commission , and Mr Andor , the Commissioner for Employment , Social Affairs and Inclusion
I have recently visited Roma settlements in Serbia and it is inconceivable that places like this still exist in Europe
I call on the Commission to do everything within its power to combat the problem of poverty and unemployment in this area
My next point relates to the budgetary consolidation
We need more investment
We discussed this earlier on this morning with Mr Kallas
We have invested too little , for example , in the trans-European networks
Now it is possible to see where the problems have arisen because we still have not implemented what was proposed in the so-called Delors Plan
because it is clear that the Council is already intending to make cuts in smaller items at a European level
We cannot tolerate this
Mr Barroso , you referred to the Monti report
This is definitely an important report and it is good that you have asked Mr Monti to prepare it , as he is an expert in this area
However , when we talk about the single market , we must also refer to the social market economy
In this context , public services in particular are very important to us
You have agreed to submit proposals for a framework directive
identity , in particular , with regard to the transport problems that we have had , which indicate , for example , how important public rail services are
Regardless of whether they are provided by the private or the public sector , they must be regulated and safeguarded by a common European policy for public services
I would now like to come to my final and decisive point
You spoke about the economic crisis and also about Greece and other countries which are in difficulties
offer
If all of this had been done two or three months ago , Greece would not have had to make high interest payments
You referred to this , but I believe that we need more than references
We need the Commission to call for these things with a powerful voice
I agree with you that this is not about intervening when the crisis has already happened and the deficits are sky-high , because this fact is frequently misunderstood
It is about preventing these things from happening as far as possible by monitoring economic and budgetary changes
Once again , I can hear governments saying that we cannot investigate their statistics or their budgetary procedure
This is not acceptable
If we want to prevent what has happened in recent months and years from occurring again , then we must do this
Why do governments have to keep their statistics and their budget procedures secret
Of course , governments must have a certain freedom
They must have this freedom and , in the euro area in particular , it must correspond with the European objectives and targets
Mr Barroso , we are ready to enter into the special partnership that you referred to
However , this partnership must be based on a strong position for Parliament and for the Commission
In the days to come , we will be negotiating on the framework agreement
It specifies some of the details , but the decisive factor is the spirit behind it
Lisbon is intended to strengthen Europe
This is why the Commission must have a powerful voice
In this case , we will go along with you and support you , even if our opinions on individual details differ
However , we must both fight for a strong Europe
This is very important , particularly in the light of the recent behaviour of some Heads of Government
ambition from the Commission , all the more so given that you committed yourself to this
On financial regulation first of all , I fully understand what Mr Barnier is trying to do
financial movements or a pure and simple ban on derivative products , as is being contemplated today in the United States
unlike the current , extremely financial services-driven economy , actually creates employment
I would very much like it if we worked on concrete projects along those lines
I cannot see any such projects in this programme today
I also believe that we need far-reaching projects
If ever there was a time to revive the idea of a Europe of the railways , it is today , with the crisis that we have gone through
At present , we have 28 000 flights each day in the European Union
This really is the time to revive this Europe of the railways that has been spoken about for decades
However , I believe that nothing will be achieved without genuine economic coordination and economic governance
Commission
We urgently need budgetary , economic and industrial coordination
We need to create a European monetary fund and , alongside it , to implement measures for stabilising the Member States' public finances
Although it is a word that is no longer used , we need to work towards fiscal convergence
I am thinking in particular of the issue of corporate taxation
Moreover , we will need to work on an own resource for the EU budget
I believe that these would be powerful acts that might well put us back on the path to growth
education
I believe that , from this point of view , you will have the support of the entire European Parliament
We are talking here about the European social model that we want and that we love
Mr President , Mr Barroso , Commissioners , I would also have liked Parliament to respond to the respect that you have shown it with a higher level of attendance
We will have to work on this
The work programme that you have presented is very wide-ranging and contains headings that sound very ambitious
Even the introduction has the title 'A new era'
However , I am not sure that the details underneath these major headings do justice to this positive-sounding approach
This is still all about the climate crisis and the financial and economic crisis
European citizens live in the south , the east and the north-west are very different
This means that we are facing major challenges
I have to agree with Mr Swoboda in particular when it comes to a social Europe and more justice
It is essential that there is a review of this area
We are not at all convinced that what is currently on the table is enough to combat the growing poverty within the European Union
Have we drawn the right conclusions from the financial crisis and the subsequent economic crisis
We believe that the right approach to financial and economic integration is to make new proposals for modifying corporation tax
We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have long since been in favour of taking this further
We also support energy taxation
You will be able to rely on us if you finally put this into practice
However , on the basis of our experience of the financial crisis , we believe that a clear objective for the tax on financial transactions is still lacking
fight for them , and this is also what Mr Sz√°jer has said
It is clear that our response to the Greek situation has been inadequate
We do not think it is acceptable that no proposal is now being made on Eurobonds
Mr Barroso , you put a very great emphasis on services of general interest during your campaign for a second period of office
The groups in Parliament have also asked you about this
inadequate
This means that you are already breaking one of your major promises
As far as protecting the climate is concerned , the various Directorates-General which are currently involved with climate protection are working on scenarios with different objectives for 2050
In the case of transport , there is a long-term goal of a 70% reduction , but for energy it is 75%
Mrs Hedegaard's people have not yet decided
I hope that they will set more ambitious objectives
However , it is clear that Bali and the two-degree goal do not play a role for any of the Directorates-General
G8
The contents of the programme will not be enough to allow us to make a successful European appearance in Bonn , in Canc√∫n or in South Africa
There is still a lot to do
on behalf of the ECR Group
and focus on one policy at a time
the futile hope that they would make it popular
That approach was wrong and it failed
We therefore welcome the new direction which has been developed by President Barroso
The European economy is still in deep crisis , and only consistent action will change that situation
I do not simply refer to the immediate crisis triggered by the failure of the banking system , or the extra pressures now provided by transport emergencies
I mean the underlying crisis which has seen the European economy left behind by more competitive and innovative economies across the Atlantic and in Asia
We therefore strongly support the centre-piece initiative of this Commission: the 2020 strategy
Whilst we believe there are details to be added and changes which should be made , the broad thrust of the policy is correct
Europe needs strategy for smart , sustainable and inclusive growth which can deliver high levels of employment , productivity and social inclusion - hear , hear
This must be the overriding priority defining the Commission
is the best anti-poverty policy yet invented
The Commission must be their ally , not their adversary
reduce barriers to trade
In taking a lead in developing a vibrant , dynamic European economy , President Barroso will have our support
We do not , of course , like everything
of the Stockholm Programme
our farmers and fishermen
to the Council
nurture a Europe playing its part in shaping an economic recovery and can offer a foundation for our long-term prosperity in the difficult and challenging years ahead
Mr President , the title of the programme that we are discussing here today is: 'Time to Act'
When it took five days to organise a videoconference among Union ministers , I can only congratulate you on your sense of humour , Mr Barroso
Why , though , is it time to act
Is it because no one has acted yet and the title is a piece of self-criticism
Or is it because this title , like all the other titles of our bureaucratic communications , is just an empty promise hiding behind piles of words
I will give you an example
We are in the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion , although the poor do not know about it
Your paper talks about an initiative - and I quote - 'to ensure that the benefits of growth and jobs are widely shared'
Is that another joke
What initiative is that , and how can it make up for the social support that Member States are withdrawing for the sake of their stability programmes
How does the Commission intend to share the benefits of something that does not exist: economic growth
How does it intend to reduce the number of poor people without touching the income of the rich and the very rich
Our disagreement with you is about policy
A return to the dictatorship of the deficit traps economies , cuts wages , cuts benefits and forces public investment into retreat
That is a recipe for more unemployment
Although it is time to act , the Commission thinks that the Union has , in the end , been able to join forces to confront the crisis
Ask the Greeks whether that is what they think , whether we have been quick and whether we have been fair
When will we have the European credit rating agency
Ask the Portuguese , whose debt interest goes up every time a Commissioner decides to talk about economics
Ask the European public
on a sense of humour
market flexibility , less bureaucracy when it comes to opening up and managing businesses , and , lastly , protection from unfair competition
proposals made by the high-level group led by Edmund Stoiber
Another important element for the competitiveness of businesses is the international trade situation
At this time of crisis , it is important to strengthen the European Union's trade defence system
no social safeguards and their associated costs or high standards of environmental protection
Another issue on which the Commission should intervene more aggressively is the fight against counterfeiting and the protection of intellectual property rights
In short , I cannot see any initiatives in the Commission's work programme aimed at implementing the cohesion policy guidelines laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon
For the first time , Article 174 of the treaty recognises the specific role of mountain regions , which represent 40% of our territory and over 90 million European citizens
and to capitalise on all the possible uses for renewable energies that mountains offer
Mr President , in the Commission work programme for 2010 , it was said that the European Union must face up to long-term challenges such as globalisation and must regain competitiveness
The problem is that the EU has not faced up to globalisation: it has embraced it
It is allowing a flood of imports from developing economies with wage rates a fraction of those in Europe
The only way in which we can possibly regain competitiveness would be to drive wage rates down to their levels
I am not , of course , even in favour of membership of the European Union
However , even if I were in favour of it , I would accuse its masters of betraying the economic interests of its peoples
services
I believe that sovereign nation states should rebuild their manufacturing bases and then protect their markets and the jobs of their nationals
However , my message is also for europhiles
Europe , either as a whole or separately , will fail to protect its manufacturing and its agriculture from Third World competition at its peril
Globalisation must be resisted , individually or collectively , or it will destroy us all
The Commission's document refers to the alleged need to develop further legal immigration policies to alleviate the perils of demographic ageing
There is no doubt that ageing populations are a concern in many countries
However , we must examine why the problems occurred
economically necessary for them
They work in order to pay the bills , not because they have a disdain for motherhood
There is no doubt that this development has had an impact on birth rates , which have been depressed artificially at the behest of economic forces
However , we do not have to take a laissez-faire approach to economic forces
Economic intervention can change those economic forces and a change in those forces will bring about a corresponding change in family demographics
European cultural overcoat that can be issued with residence and citizenship papers
The children of such immigrants are allegedly as European as the indigenous population; they are not
Distinctive cultures are made by distinctive peoples and not the other way round
We are not the product of our cultures: our cultures are the products of our peoples
Replacing Europeans with people from the Third World will mean that Europe will be replaced by the Third World
Europe is slowly but steadily being ethnically cleansed of Europeans
- I feel able to say that there is , nonetheless , in this House , broad agreement on the programme that we have just presented
If there is one common factor that I have detected in the speeches of the most representative political groups , it is the idea of ambition
We need greater ambition in Europe
In this regard , I wish to take up a few ideas that have been voiced , ideas with which , I might add , I am in particular agreement
Our friend , Mr Sz√°jer , spoke of the need to avoid , in fact , the model of the five-year plan of the communist regimes
That is precisely why we want to maintain this flexibility , which is important if we are to adapt to a changing environment
supervision of national public accounts
Member States , which did not want the Commission to be able to play that role
I therefore hope that the lesson to be learnt from this crisis is that we are increasingly interdependent , that economic policy in Europe is not just a national matter
It is a national matter , of course , but it is also a matter of common European interests , since we need a greater degree of coordination
In this respect , I believe that Mr Sz√°jer , Mr Swoboda , Mrs De Sarnez and all the others are agreed on the need for such increasingly coordinated economic policy
enhanced partnership between the Commission and the European Parliament when we talk about the financial perspective , about the need to resist certain rather intergovernmental interpretations that one hears nowadays
Such interpretations are surprising , because the Treaty of Lisbon is , in fact , the exact opposite of intergovernmentalism: it strengthens the European dimension
I hope that we will be able to learn lessons from this crisis by moving in the direction of more , not less , Europe
One example - to which Mrs De Sarnez referred - is the issue of financial regulation
States unanimously agreed to reduce the ambition of the proposals that the Commission presented following the de Larosi√®re report
This shows , therefore , that there is , at times , a gap between what is said and what is decided
European level , because we do , in fact , need that ambition
The important thing now , I would stress , is to understand the principle of subsidiarity properly
I am in favour of subsidiarity
it means
Subsidiarity means deciding which level of decision making is best
On the subject of this air traffic crisis , the events taking place are , all the same , odd
that the European Union now admits that it was mistaken in deciding to suspend flights
That is unbelievable
If there is one area that comes under national jurisdiction , it is European air traffic control
The decision was taken by each European national regulator
Yet the very people who are against European-level powers are now protesting against Europe
Soon , the talk will be that it was the European Commission and Brussels that created the volcano in Iceland
It is all really rather extraordinary
(Applause)
Let us be clear
There are different levels of responsibility: national levels and European levels
In each case , we have to see which is the most appropriate level
state clearly what is , and what is not , our responsibility
place under the responsibility of Brussels , as is sometimes said , or perhaps of Strasbourg too , what is frankly a national responsibility
Let us show some common sense
are democratic Member States
The 2020 agenda , I believe , focuses Europe on what is most important
What we need now is growth , but not just any old growth; we need fairer , more open , more sustainable and more intelligent growth that is focused on the future
We need to create new sources of growth in order to successfully tackle our biggest problem , which we shall be discussing this afternoon , namely , unemployment and , more specifically , youth unemployment
produce concrete results for our fellow citizens
my colleagues do too - by your words of support and , in certain cases , by your demands
We shall try to prove equal to the task with which you are entrusting us
(Applause)
Thank you very much , Mr Barroso , for your statement
Parliament
it is then that we understand how much we need the European Union and action from the Commission
The responsibility of the European Parliament has also risen markedly with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , and we are pleased about this
We think that this is good for Europeans - that it is good for our citizens
Now , we have to accept more responsibility and use the opportunities presented by the treaty
I would like to assure you once again , Mr Barroso , that you and the European Commission have allies , here , and I speak for the majority of the European Parliament
clearly in line with the objectives of the Spanish Presidency of the European Union and with the programme of the trio of presidencies made up of Spain , Belgium and Hungary
Commission's legislative programme
The Commission has worked very hard
few months later , and is working hard to make up for lost time in a constructive , positive way , which the Spanish Presidency is grateful for
positive way , and we recognise its efforts in this respect
It is also grateful to the European Parliament
Whenever there has been a debate here on these issues , the European Parliament has always had a very constructive attitude
initiatives - and for this to happen as soon as possible so that we can make up for the lost time that I was referring to
I am sure that we are going to have Parliament's cooperation as well
Thank you for your statement on behalf of the Council and your support for the Commission's programme
I would like , once again , to thank Mr Barroso , all the Vice-Presidents of the Commission and the Commissioners for their presence
This testifies to the fact that the Commission places great importance on cooperation with Parliament , which was also as we had hoped
The debate is closed
Written statements (Rule 149)
revamping the instruments and working methods used by the European Union
during its meeting in December 2009
the benefits of an area of freedom , security and justice
as combating organised crime , terrorism and other threats through improving police and judicial cooperation
Currently , Europe is facing increasing unemployment and almost 17% of Europe's inhabitants are living below the poverty line
many people on middle incomes towards poverty
Therefore , we must firstly focus particular attention on the problem of poverty facing those in work
To increase employment , we must create new jobs , not just any jobs , but try to ensure high quality employment , taking into account the demands of the labour market
Most attention should be paid to increasing youth unemployment , one of society's most acute problems
If young people are not given opportunities to enter the labour market , then the danger is that Europe will lose a whole generation of young people
For some time , Europe's demographic situation has also been forcing us to consider the employment of older people
We must provide for labour relations that promote employment and ensure the possibility of life-long learning
I would like to underline that we should also discuss the employment of disabled people
and self-worth
Therefore , I would like to ask the Commission how Europe will create new jobs
What are the real chances for people to enter the labour market
How can we ensure quality employment so that we can reduce the poverty of those in work
The Commission work programme for 2010 consists of 14 pages of the usual commonplaces and platitudes
It is right that Europe must respond jointly to the crisis
However , this is a crisis which was only able to have such a negative effect on Europe because of Commission policy and unrestricted liberalisation in all areas
Nevertheless , no one wants to change anything
and their citizens
The Europe 2020 strategy is intended to be the response to the current crisis
the financial markets
in Greece
because climate change , which is primarily a natural phenomenon , cannot be resolved simply by focusing on CO2
In addition , this will put the European economy under even further pressure compared with its competitors in America and Asia , where no initiatives of this kind are planned
The Commission work programme for 2010 has established the right priorities
on combating the financial crisis
It is important that , in particular , those EU citizens who have lost their jobs during the current crisis are given new prospects for the future as quickly as possible
provide added value on the labour market as a result of the leading role played by Europe in protecting the environment
In order to make the changeover to a new and sustainable industrial age , we should no longer regard job creation and comprehensive protection for the environment as mutually contradictory
In my view , the Commission has been somewhat cautious in taking up this approach
We need to be laying the foundations for this now
We will be able to achieve a great deal if we can improve the way in which existing regulations are applied
I congratulate Mr Barroso on the ambitious Commission legislative and work programme for 2010
Unfortunately , time is running out - there are already only eight months left
In spite of this , I hope the priorities will not be only empty promises
The strength of the programme is its measures for combating the crisis
Unfortunately , these concern mainly the economic situation
strategy for improving communication with the Union's citizens
We have been working on the phenomenon of violence against women for years
It is high time there were effective , European legal regulations in this area
I would like to see a proposal in the Commission's programme for a directive on combating violence against women
As for social objectives , the initiative to create a European Platform against Poverty before the end of this year is important
Unfortunately , there are no specific details of any kind about this
They have to be given at the meeting of the Council in June
On the matter of modernisation of the Union and the instruments of its operation , I would like to call attention to communication with the citizens
This must be a process , and not electioneering
There is a communication gap between the EU and its citizens , which we must strive to reduce , and , in the future , to eliminate
We must give EU citizens the feeling that they are 'at the heart' of the Union's activities
Only then will the results of referendums not be a surprise
The debate on the Commission's programme is particularly important because it coincides with the beginning of a new era in the European Union
financial markets and stabilisation of the euro , which should restore the confidence of the public , as well as of the economic and social players
I would like to stress the importance of the cohesion policy in the implementation of the various European policies
at various levels: national , regional and local
use of the Structural Funds
It is vital to define the guidelines for cohesion policy and the financial perspective for the post-2013 period
economic development and therefore require special measures

I think the way we will prepare the work programmes in the future should be a concrete demonstration of the special partnership which I and the Commission want to
Honourable Members , the Commission work programme for 2010 that we are proud to present today is an ambitious , but also necessary and realistic , framework for European policy making in the
It is realistic if all institutions are ready to join forces and cooperate with a view to delivering timely results to Europe's citizens; it is necessary because business as
usual is not an option if we want 2010 to mark a turning point; and it is ambitious because , more than ever , a strong Europe is required to deliver to
We distinguish between executive and legislative authority , but our cooperation is of crucial significance for our citizens , so it is with great pleasure that we have listened to your
- (HU) Mr President , on behalf of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) , we welcome the fact that the Commission has ambitiously set to work and presented its 2010
We take this in the spirit in which it was meant , that the Commission is present , and as a sign of respect for Parliament , of taking Parliament seriously , and
At the same time , we regret that much time has already been wasted this year , since the delay in the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon has already prevented
The Treaty of Lisbon came into force , and henceforth we can no longer make any excuses , as Members of the European Parliament , nor does the Commission or the Council , for
not taking decisive action and not starting the work , that is , implementing that which the Treaty of Lisbon prescribes and fulfilling what citizens want , placing them at the centre of
The two lists , which I would like now to cite briefly , consist simply of a list of what the Commission should not do , and a list that itemises what
First , we would like to ask that the Commission not do what has been the practice till now , because that would render this debate meaningless , namely , that by October , only
It is for this reason that we consider it important that these legislative proposals or work programmes are not considered on a par with the old Communist five-year plans ,
The governments of these countries are responsible for these crises; however , in the interest of the common good , we should have raised our voices louder and more decisively in
When we say 2020 , then I - an MEP from a former Communist country - associate this once again with the five-year plan , or the sort of number they
Why do we not call the 2020 programme the European Union's job creation programme , why do we not call the Stockholm Programme - a name that , by the way ,
However , this must be kept in proportion - I would ask the Commission to take note of this - and it must take place in chronological order , in order
I would like to take this opportunity to say how important this issue is , against the background of the recent Roma summit in Cordoba , at which you were not present ,
When you talk about partnership , Mr Barroso , I would ask you to remember that we need this partnership , particularly with regard to the budget issue and future budget planning ,
We do not want to cover all the individual points here and now , but I believe that we will have to rely on these public services for the European
In our previous discussions with Mr Van Rompuy , we established that the actions taken by the European Council in this case did not represent the best that Europe can

It is along the right lines , but I believe that we could have gone further and considered other avenues , such as the separation of banking activities , the taxation of
However - and , for me , this is more important still - I believe that we absolutely must do everything we can to promote the real economy and sustainable investment which ,
From this point of view , I regret that the Council is in charge of a working group on this issue; I would have preferred it to have been your
I would like to say one more thing about the future economic strategy of the Union for 2020: please , do not give up quantified objectives in relation to poverty and
The case of Greece has once again demonstrated that we not only have a growing divide in economic terms , but also in social terms , because the conditions in which

I think that what you have said about public services and how they should be regulated under the heading 'Putting people at the heart of European action' is completely
What use is all the talk about a major new European climate diplomacy initiative if we have obviously given up on Bali and on the agreements made by the
- Mr President , talking of programmes , let me remind you of the lesson of the 1992 programme: for the Commission to achieve results , it needs to set one priority
The effort to establish the single market was a worthwhile objective which could be easily understood by all those involved - and , crucially , by the public - but since
then , all too frequently , we have seen the Commission launching initiative after initiative , regardless of whether Europe was the appropriate forum or whether it could really deliver tangible benefits , in
Our future economic prosperity and all the benefits it can generate depend on successful businesses and entrepreneurs; they are the ones who create wealth and sustainable productive jobs , and that
We therefore welcome the commitments to relaunch the single market , extending it further , to emphasise smart regulation , to ensure that the implementation of rules is consistent and fair throughout
the Union , to reduce substantially the administrative burden and cut down on red tape and address bottlenecks , to share best practice in training , to modernise the labour market and to
We are concerned that some measures might result in infringements of the rights and responsibilities of Member States , such as the concept of a Citizens' Europe or some aspects
We are encouraged by the prospect of reform in the common agricultural and fisheries policies , but concerned this may result in more bureaucracy rather than a fair solution for
Finally , we do not agree that common initiatives undertaken by Member States in the field of foreign affairs should be totally taken over by the Commission rather than left
The ECR was founded to uphold the principle of subsidiarity; we want a Europe which focuses on its proper key tasks and delivers real benefits , and we are hopeful that
President Barroso and his Commission - all of whom are here , one for each of us , today - seize the opportunity evident in much of the work programme presented to
Ask the European public why things are as they are and they will look at the messenger and end up smiling , because in the end , there is no tax
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , enterprises , in particular , small and medium-sized enterprises , which make up 99% of Europe's productive fabric , need four fundamental elements: easier access to credit , greater labour
We value the work done by the Commission to streamline European legislation with the annulment of 1 600 legislative acts during the last term of office , and we support the
Businesses cannot compete with social and environmental dumping strategies implemented by some emerging economies such as China , where the cost of labour is extremely low and where there are
I therefore call on you to include in the Commission's next legislative programme a proposal for a framework programme to support the development of and to protect mountain regions ,

Many women pursue uninterrupted careers and refrain from having children out of choice - and that is their perfect right - but many others pursue careers because it is
The idea that we can import large families from the Third World as a substitute for unborn European children is based on a particularly pernicious and wrong-headed assumption , which
is that we are the products of nurture and that Third World cultures are like overcoats that can be taken off at the port of entry and replaced with a
Mr President , in general - we are not talking about those who have said clearly and honestly that they are against the Union and against membership of the European Union
At the same time , I would like to confirm once again , in response to Mr Sz√°jer , but also to Mr Swoboda , that they are right when they call for greater
action from the EU in economic and financial terms , and when they point out how the Member States have resisted , for example , the Commission playing a greater role in the
The first Commission of which I had the honour of being President presented a specific regulation aimed at giving greater audit powers to Eurostat , and that was rejected by certain
This is how we make progress , and in this respect , I wish to highlight in particular the ambition expressed by Mr Swoboda - and I thank him - for an
It is , all the same , odd , not to say ironic , that after so many requests from certain Member States for measures in the field of financial regulation , the Member
I hope that we , the European Parliament and the Commission , will together be able to fill that gap in order to try to achieve a little more consistency at
In this respect , I am also keen to voice my agreement , Mr Kirkhope , with this idea of subsidiarity , but it is important to have a proper understanding of what
I have seen today in the press - and not only in the Eurosceptic or Europhobe press , not only in the tabloids , but also in the quality press -
I can tell you that the Commission is ready to assume its responsibilities , but I believe that we must build an alliance with the European Parliament in order to
Without this alliance , we will always have this instinctive need - and , in times of crisis , we know that it is easier to resort to nationalist , populist rhetoric - to
Let us concentrate on what we can do at European level , in areas where we can add value to our action , while respecting , of course , our Member States , which
It is in this area , in fact , that we need to build this alliance between the European institutions , by also working honestly and loyally with our Member States to
I believe that in this regard , we have a good foundation for our work in the coming years and , after this debate , I feel encouraged - and I believe that
I would like to say that when it comes to the European Commission's efforts on behalf of our European Community , the Commission has a huge ally in the European
Most Members support these efforts and the view of the Commission that it should take on more responsibility , especially in the crisis situation which we spoke about earlier -
Mr President , I just wanted to congratulate the Commission and its President , Jos√© Manuel Dur√£o Barroso , on the ambitious , very pro-European programme that he has presented here today , which is

Mr Barroso and all the members of the Commission - vice-presidents and commissioners - are also aware that we are working with the Commission , I think in a very
I would like to take this opportunity to ask the European Parliament once again for these legislative initiatives to be adopted - today we are talking primarily about legislative
The European Commission's work programme for 2010 is an ambitious and flexible multiannual programme setting out the following main objectives: tackling the crisis and supporting Europe's social market economy , drawing
up a citizens' agenda which puts people at the heart of Europe's activities , developing an ambitious and consistent foreign policy agenda with a global dimension and , last but not least ,
One key element of the citizens' agenda is the Stockholm Programme for 'an open and secure Europe serving and protecting the citizens' , which was adopted by the European Council
I would like to welcome the Commission's initiative in presenting an action plan for implementing the Stockholm Programme so that we can ensure that European citizens will actually enjoy
The programme will mainly focus on the fight against cross-border crime and will consolidate the enforcement of the common policy on immigration and asylum , covering , in particular , areas such
Each day , many Europeans , even those in employment , are struggling with poverty and do not have opportunities to enjoy life to the full , as the recession is even pushing
It is important to give them the conditions to join the labour market , not just because of demographic changes , but for themselves , to ensure their own sense of dignity
On the contrary , the further removal of trade restrictions which the Commission wants to push through will encourage globalisation , benefit large companies and cause damage to the Member States
As far as the specific measures are concerned , the approach to economic and financial policy seems sensible , as does the development of a new European supervision architecture for monitoring
Stricter controls on public finances and budgetary discipline within the Member States will hopefully allow us to avoid problems in future , such as those which we are currently experiencing
The Commission's new tax plans , together with the review of the energy taxation directive , which involves taxing energy products on the basis of their energy content , should be rejected
As well as modernising ways of working , which will be a decisive factor in stimulating the economy , and increasing the involvement of European citizens , the Commission is focusing primarily
As the spokesperson on the environment for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) , I am concerned that we should create as many sustainable jobs as possible and
In the section on the citizens' agenda , there are no anti-discrimination initiatives , such as combating violence against women , greater determination and engagement in achieving social objectives and a long-term
The need to adopt measures at this time of crisis that can address the challenges in the long term makes it imperative to prioritise job creation , regulation of the

Furthermore , the Community budget for the transport infrastructure is almost non-existent for the 2010-2013 period , even though the challenges and development needs are enormous: ensuring intermodality between different forms of

Kyrgyzstan (debate)
The next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on Kyrgyzstan
High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission
- Mr President , I am pleased to have this opportunity to make a statement on Kyrgyzstan
As this House knows very well , the situation on the ground remains somewhat fluid and tense
8 April
I sent a delegation almost immediately , headed by the EU Special Representative , Pierre Morel , to the country and we stayed in close contact throughout his visit
The coordinated EU-UN-OSCE effort that started last week in Bishkek continues at the moment and will continue until the crisis and its consequences are overcome
say that he has completed his tasks
The resignation of the President , on the basis of Article 50 of the present Kyrgyz Constitution , and his departure from the country is expected to reduce political tension
However , that is not the end of the crisis , and we have important work to do
Most importantly , we have to ensure stability and public order , and while the situation has generally calmed down , violence continues
Reports told us yesterday that as many as five people were killed in riots in the suburbs of Bishkek
All sides need to be careful and avoid provocation
The restoration of law and order must be a priority
Citizens and businesses in Kyrgyzstan need to be able to go about their daily life without fear for their lives or for their physical integrity
The second issue concerns the legitimacy of the provisional government
law
Elements of such a 'roadmap' have been announced - a new constitution is being drawn up and submitted to referendum and presidential and parliamentary elections are to be held
We will be happy to look at such a plan
What is important for us in this context is that the constitutional process is inclusive and participatory
Representatives of all parties and ethnic groups should be able to contribute to a new draft constitution before it is submitted to a referendum
The early indications - I can tell honourable Members - are encouraging
I hope these will be confirmed over the coming days , and I will discuss this with Ministers in Luxembourg on Monday
necessary political , financial and technical support
With the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe , we could contribute to the work on constitutional reform and the updating of electoral legislation
We know from the presidential elections last year that there is considerable room for progress
can to help turn their aspirations for a democratic and open society into reality
Thirdly , it is clear that Kyrgyzstan needs material assistance
In the very short term , we are willing to address any humanitarian needs that recent events might have created
to be major unmet humanitarian needs at this stage
However , there may be specific medical needs
The Commission , through DG ECHO , will , of course , keep monitoring the humanitarian situation in the country and adjust as necessary
We will continue the assistance that is already ongoing , notably in the fields of human rights , education and poverty eradication
Fourthly , after the dramatic events of the last two weeks , there is a need for accountability and justice
More than 80 persons died and many hundreds were wounded from gunfire opened against demonstrators in Bishkek
These events cannot simply be put on one side
We need clarity brought on what actually happened , on who was responsible , and on what needs to be done to avoid this ever being repeated in the future
Finally , as the recent crisis has shown , there is a need for genuine economic and social reforms
Unfortunately , the example of Kyrgyzstan shows how bad government and the lack of genuine reform can bring political instability and ultimately violence
The upheaval and the widespread looting that followed , and now the rise in organised , large-scale crime , further aggravates the situation
very interested to hear the views of the honourable Members on this matter
Mr President , Baroness Ashton , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank you very much for your assessment of the situation
I believe your assessment to be correct that we should first try to restore law and order and safeguard human lives and then begin to build on this foundation
yardstick for political stability
Of course , this also includes equality , which often suffers as a result of corruption and other similar factors
Whether justifiably or not , this was obviously one of the causes of the clashes
crucial importance
The whole region is of major strategic significance to us , not just the individual countries
former republics of the Soviet Union
If this were to take the form of fundamentalism , the results could be catastrophic for us
For this reason , providing aid to these countries is of extreme importance , not only from the perspective of the aid itself , but also in relation to our interests
rebuilding old power relationships that would not allow for modern development
Mr President , Baroness Ashton , I would also like to thank you for your statement
A dictator or a president who behaves like a dictator is removed from power
His successor celebrates and is pleased to be able to introduce democracy for his subjects
to his son or other family members
We hope that this cycle is not beginning again and that Mrs Otunbayeva has a different approach
Her past , and the attitude that she has often demonstrated , are indicators of this
However , indicators are not enough
We need real proof
If she is not to suffer the same fate as her predecessor , she must take a different approach and ensure that she helps the people of her country
a peaceful life in exile , which will give the Kyrgyz population the chance to build a democratic state
Unfortunately , the situation that I have described does not apply only to Kyrgyzstan
Similar conditions can also be found in other countries
We wish the representative for Kazakhstan success with his task on behalf of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
However , the situation in Kazakhstan is also far from ideal
The same thing also applies to Uzbekistan and to other countries
countries - is one that we must follow up
This is a very sensitive region , as Mr Brok has already said
Mr Morel is doing a good job as the Special Representative , but this is not enough
I would like to remind everyone that during the German Presidency with Dr Steinmeier , a strategy for Central Asia was drawn up which we have heard very little about recently
Therefore , I would like to ask you to take up this strategy again and to transform it into a stability strategy for the region
This is not only about the energy supply from Turkmenistan through to Kazakhstan
It is also a question of the stability and , in particular , the political stability of a region which is very close to Afghanistan
We know that in some countries , such as Uzbekistan , the situation is very fragile and problematic
Of course , it is ultimately a question of humanity , because there really should not be any victims at all
Against this background , we need to make a new attempt to put in place a strategy for Central Asia which covers the economy , democracy and humanity
I would ask you to use the case of Kyrgyzstan as the opportunity to renew this strategy for Central Asia and to give it a new stimulus
out to safeguard his memory against foreign attacks and to protect his tomb
in the face of enemy attacks
that new
series of reforms , a set of measures , which must be clear
which is very far removed from the current situation
Also - and this is linked to both the issue of the judiciary and to corruption - to streamline what is an extremely oppressive bureaucratic nomenclature and public administration
In fact , this is the first real test of the European Union's new Central Asia strategy in a critical , emergency situation of the type currently existing in Kyrgyzstan
believe that this is an opportunity for us all to make a commitment
who genuinely took seriously the needs and interests of the people with regard to democracy and codetermination
Unfortunately , that was not the case and now he has suffered the same fate as his predecessor
The European Union must exert significance influence in this case
Baroness Ashton , I welcomed the fact that you said that you have sent the Special Representative , Mr Morel , to the region
I think that was both sensible and useful
However , it is equally necessary for the EU now to revise its strategy for Central Asia to make it really effective
I hope the Council will begin work on this next Monday
My question is: How do you intend to tackle this
How do you plan to ensure that a genuinely comprehensive process is put in place for developing a constitution which involves everyone , as you have proposed
We need to help this region and Kyrgyzstan to move towards cooperation and away from confrontation
I believe that this is important for the future of the entire region and beyond
(FR) Mr President , Madam Vice-President , ladies and gentlemen , the situation in Kyrgyzstan is , in fact , particularly unstable
Nevertheless , this country has been , and perhaps still is , one of those that seemed most open to the setting up of democratic institutions
The Tulip revolution in 2005 once again raised immense hope
defenders and journalists have paid a heavy price
left the country , and yesterday new riots actually took place , as you said , in the south of the country and around the capital
Commissioner , this country is actually of considerable strategic importance , and not only in military terms
It must not be the playing field of certain major powers
Despite some discussions , the European Union still does not have a great enough presence in this region of the world
Its support and its diplomatic presence remain half-hearted
One only has to read the stories that are breaking at present on the situation in that country to be persuaded of this
This is not just about the United States , Russia and Kazakhstan , the country that currently holds the presidency of the OECD
However , the EU's support is essential to ensure that country's independence
have already said , implement a proper strategy for this region of the world
Yes , we must help this country to combat poverty; 40% of the population there lives below the poverty threshold
world
Yes , of course , we must support democracy and the defence of human rights
This is now a matter of the utmost urgency
Our undertaking , Commissioner , can and must be to prevent this country from swinging towards fundamentalism and a new authoritarian regime
democracy
This is the key to ensuring that the country plays a major role in this region of the world
of raw materials and energy
with the local situation
that this entails
Europe and others , including the OSCE , could contribute to helping the country develop institutions that are stable , operational , less corrupt and more democratic
One such show of support could be an observation mission for the coming elections
widespread awareness of the law and the rights of individuals
We must provide long-term assistance in this area
Mr President , last week's riots have led Kyrgyzstan into a political , judicial and economic crisis
Its constitutional court was practically disbanded and the interim government's actions appear uncoordinated
Meanwhile , the brother of Kurmanbek Bakiyev has announced that the hand-written resignation statement is a fake and that Bakiyev did not himself resign
According to eye-witnesses , new local groups trying to take over regional governments have emerged
Similarly , ethnic-based groupings appear , creating fear of more ethnic violence
Criminal groups operate freely in the country
Large numbers of weapons are being circulated and robberies are taking place
Safety , security and the interests of the EU citizens in this country are still endangered
The present interim government is unable to counter any of these threats
The situation is completely unclear for the local people
High Representative Ashton has issued two statements expressing her concern , but more active and practical actions are urgently needed instead
It is important that the EU take a decisive position on the situation in Kyrgyzstan in this strategically important country
their lives and defend their property
It is clear that the EU should pursue an independent investigation into the causes and effects of the riots
About the material resources of the Kyrgyz Bank and the agency for investment and development: they need to be evaluated before assigning any further financial assistance
interests and credibility in the region and in the rest of the world
its democratic institutions
As regards the last fifteen years , I can give you my own assurance , having been personally involved in my capacity as a member of the OSCE and otherwise
The people who were governing up to yesterday and the people who overturned them are all cogs in the same corrupt system
The army is in the capital , carrying out searches and making arrests as we speak
Despite this , we need to give the present regime a chance , because we are in the final stage before civil war and the break up of the country
who was ambassador in Brussels up to 4 years ago
I would disagree slightly as to whether the people of Kyrgyzstan can ward off terrorism
presence of the OSCE in Kyrgyzstan does not appear to be bearing fruit in terms of democratisation
Of course , there is a permanent humanitarian crisis which may not be acute , but there has been no modernisation and no improvement in democratic institutions over all these years
People are living well below the poverty line
to date in the area
is a major danger for the destabilisation of the whole of Central and Western Asia , and of Europe
If the European Union wants to play an effective peacekeeping role , it needs to act now
(RO) The situation in Kyrgyzstan is giving particular cause for concern
This country has a strategic position in Central Asia
It hosts on its territory a US military base making a major contribution to the operations in Afghanistan , as well as Russian troops
It is unfortunate that the protests of the last few weeks have degenerated into violence and have resulted in the loss of human life
The authorities must take measures aimed at protecting civilian lives
Just yesterday , new clashes took place among ethnic Kyrgyz , Russians and Turks
Given that large Russian and Uzbek communities live in this country , if interethnic clashes continue , the stability of the whole region will be affected
Mrs Ashton , the European Union must focus particular attention on the conflict in Kyrgyzstan , provide humanitarian aid and get involved in stabilising the situation
(SL) Madam Ashton , we are here to discuss the alarming events in Kyrgyzstan and to help as much as we can to stabilise the situation in this country
regard to another issue , which has been removed from this sitting's agenda
However , because it is topical and because human lives are at stake , I feel obliged to call your attention to it
I am talking about the plight of Sahrawi activists , peacekeepers from Western Sahara being detained in Moroccan prisons , who are on hunger strike and are risking their lives
Amnesty International has also called our attention to their plight
I would therefore ask , Madam Ashton , that you and your colleagues pay immediate attention to this problem because , otherwise , it might be too late
instead delivered corruption , nepotism and increasing autocracy
the EU's priority for the region
and overthrow of the Bakiyev regime
President Roza Otunbayeva served briefly as Ambassador to the United Kingdom , so she knows the workings of the European Union well
ISAF in Afghanistan as well
(PL) Mr President , five years after the Tulip Revolution , when President Akayev stood down , a bloody revolution has taken place
Two reasons can , of course , be given
Firstly , the problem of nepotism and corruption and hence , the absence of the foundations of a democratic state , and secondly , the country's financial and economic problems
Mrs Ashton's initiative , which has meant that Mr Morel can , today , give us a full report on what is really happening in Kyrgyzstan , seems fairly important
I would like to make a fervent appeal in relation to the situation in Kyrgyzstan
The country is , we know , an area of Russian influence , and also has an American military base
The European Union's active participation should be based , principally , on building the foundations of a democratic country , and also on ensuring internal security
Over 80 fatalities is a bad signal for the building of Kyrgyzstan
So I repeat my fervent appeal and have my fingers crossed for Mrs Ashton's mission
of hope there was at the very start and after his name was initially associated with democratic optimism
There is a simple explanation for this situation
Due to the lack of stable institutions , politicians are likely to cause disappointment and get involved in this cycle of conflict , corruption and blackmail
blackmail the West
Therefore , the solution lies in setting up institutions created by consent , based on a broad consultation process and a wide consensus and degree of compromise among the political forces
However , the main priority is to urgently put an end to the violence , as mentioned by the High Representative
construction from getting under way
Foreign Affairs , in whose opinion Kyrgyzstan's fate seems to lean ever closer to the Russian economic and border space

his resignation
Many weapons are in circulation in Kyrgyzstan , a small country with just 5
3 million inhabitants , and the only country in the world to house both a US and a Russian military base
to put paid to a possible civil war and help the country move towards a democratic parliamentary republic with a stable presidency within the next six months
High Representative - a substantial and material contribution
Our timeliness in providing aid to reduce and weaken all social tension will be decisive
Baroness Ashton , let us act quickly and for the best , because this will be another important test for Europe
We are not in Haiti , but in Kyrgyzstan
Let us at least try to get there in time on this occasion
(DE) Mr President , when the Soviet Union broke up at the beginning of the 1990s , many people believed that the young democracies would develop almost of their own accord
Now we know that these new states have inherited huge problems from the Soviet Union
During the Soviet era , differences between the ethnic groups were largely suppressed , which is why there is so much religious and cultural conflict in these countries today
Democracy does not just develop overnight and it will not emerge at all while corrupt clans are growing rich at the expense of the country and its citizens
Rumour has it that the snipers who shot into the crowd in Bishkek were Uzbek and Tajik mercenaries
It seems that this was an attempt to provoke an international conflict which could put the whole of Central Asia at risk
European foreign policy should help to defuse the situation
However , military intervention is the wrong approach , as is clearly shown by the German presence in Afghanistan
It is essential to provide intelligent , targeted economic and development aid
We must give priority to combating corruption and to depriving the local clans of their power
It is really only then that democracy will have a genuine chance in Central Asia
(FR) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Europeana project is taking on a new , ambitious dimension
With this EU digital library , the diversity and the wealth of our culture will be made accessible
It is essential that our different countries be heavily involved in this project
A crucial aspect of this initiative concerns a fundamental value: respect for cultural and linguistic diversity

I could not agree more that social and economic development is essential as part of the strategy that we need to put forward
Mrs Swoboda talked too about the importance of making sure that what we have before us is a genuine political reform
We are working very closely with the UN and with the OSCE
central to what happens next and I agree completely about the political stability of the region
It is very important
We need to look again very carefully
what we should be doing within this region to pull together the different elements of Commission and Council support
of honourable Members who talked about the value and importance of the rule of law
the legal system of course , but also in the political and constitutional reform that is so essential

and constitutional reform and the elections and the link that we want to make economically too
Members will know

Those are just some of the elements that I would include
I think that we are probably right in the level of presence in the region
Pierre Morel has been there for several days
He has just come back
He will be briefing Mr Borys of the AFET Committee on 27 April to bring the committee up to date with all the events
We are in touch by text every few hours and we have spoken several times and he has been in touch of course with colleagues too
We have had a strong presence in him , I pay tribute to him and to his team for the work that they have done

the opposition who were oppressed by the former President and who were supported by the European Union including , of course , Members of this House
says it will have and , if it is willing to do those things , to support it now into the future
And on that basis , I am very grateful for the comments which have been made and we will pursue the strategy as I have outlined

Written statements (Rule 149)
hopes of democratic change in the former Soviet republic in 2005
The European Parliament is following the development of the political crisis in the country with great concern
development and interregional cooperation is of interest to the EU , not least , due to the importance of Central Asia for our energy supplies and our economic and trade partnership
The risk of civil war breaking out and of a 'second Afghanistan' must be averted
and the country's problems resolved
return of democratic life in Kyrgyzstan
Stabilisation of the situation in Central Asia will guarantee good cooperation with the EU
No one is in any doubt that Kyrgyzstan plays a special role here
American military base which is supporting NATO forces in Afghanistan
At the same time , the failure to carry out suitable reforms after Kyrgyzstan gained independence has led to the dramatic situation which we are seeing today
At present , let us concentrate on ensuring security to civilians and on giving them humanitarian aid
In addition , we should take every possible measure to prevent radicalisation of the country
We must not allow civil war to break out
In the long-term perspective , it is essential to develop a new strategy for the entire region

In particular , we should send a team of observers to the next elections

rights
Mr President , Baroness Ashton , I welcome the fact that the European Union's Special Representative has been sent to Kyrgyzstan
We must know what the plans of the interim government there are
It must be guaranteed that there will be an end to violence in Kyrgyzstan , and the development of the rule of law and democracy there must be ensured
a move away from democratic values and the country's poor economic situation
Our expectation should thus be to see Kyrgyzstan change before long into a democratic state governed by the rule of law
necessary support for carrying out the long-awaited social , economic and political reforms
carrying out reforms , just as we have done in Kosovo , Macedonia and elsewhere
with the people living in the area of the former Soviet Union cannot be underestimated
With the change of regime which is taking place , we cannot miss any opportunity to facilitate a move towards democratic values in Kyrgyzstan
It would therefore be irresponsible of us to leave Kyrgyzstan without support and make it dependent on some of its large neighbours
Kyrgyzstan has attracted quite some media and political attention , and I have followed developments closely from the beginning , making two statements , one on 7 April and the other on
Yesterday , I spoke with the Kazakh Foreign Minister Saudabayev , who today is visiting Bishkek as Chair-in-Office of the OSCE , and who has literally just sent me a message to
Although President Bakiyev has officially resigned , the provisional government needs to commit to a clear plan for how to return to constitutional and democratic order and the rule of
If we are satisfied the provisional government is committed to a quick return to legitimacy and genuinely wants to join the democratic family , we will be ready to provide the
With the OSCE , we are willing to work on the preparations and modalities for monitoring the elections and , with the people of Kyrgyzstan , we are ready to do what we
On the basis of the information that we have had from our partners in the field - the Red Cross and the UN Development Programme - there do not seem
I will discuss with Ministers on Monday the political framework in which the European Union will be ready to address the most pressing needs , but of course , today , I am
On the other hand , and you explained this in your last remark , the extent to which economic and social development is needed is clear , because this is also an important
We must be aware that these countries are sufficiently unstable that our efforts to bring about stability by contributing to improved state-building , democracy and the rule of law are of
This relates not only to the available energy sources , but to the area as a whole , in particular , if we consider the religious orientation of the majority of the
We should remember that the neighbouring countries in the region , some of which are very large , are responsible for ensuring that these weaknesses are not exploited with the aim of
After a few months , he is in the same position and it seems as if democracy has only been restored for the purpose of making comfortable , well-paid positions available
I hope that the president who has been thrown out of office will be sensible enough not to spread new discord and will make a genuine attempt to live
The question of how we can encourage the development of democracy there - because it is not a product that we can simply deliver , it must emerge in these
Mr President , Baroness Ashton , ladies and gentlemen , there is a wonderful concluding passage in the Kyrgyz epic Manas - which is no small work of literature , being 20 times longer
than the Odyssey and the Iliad put together and also an aid to understanding this country's history - where the wife of the hero who represents the whole population sets
In the end , she decides that the name on his tomb should be that of his wife , instead of the hero Manas , precisely to ensure that it remains intact
This type of dedication for the common good , for the people , should be what we expect from the new Kyrgyz ruling class , which is not , in point of fact , all
Of course , I advise the High Representative to adopt a constructive and I would say positive , yet cautious attitude towards the interim government , but also to call for a
Not only an international board of enquiry into what has taken place , not only a clear schedule for restoring democratic rules - because this interim government , by its very definition ,
is not sanctioned as a legitimate government by the popular vote - but also reforms to oppose corruption firmly and effectively , and ultimately to make Kyrgyzstan independent from the judiciary ,
We must not let this country , where the influence of the United States is now very limited , end up in the rather suffocating grip of present-day Russia , and so I
Mr President , Baroness Ashton , we know how much people hoped in 2005 at the time of the Tulip Revolution that everything would change when a new president came into office
Mr Bakiyev has failed; he has been incapable of responding to the population's needs and demands; he has allowed corruption to develop , and played his own part in it
with a certain clannishness; he has emptied the coffers , if some statements are to be believed; and he has installed an increasingly authoritarian regime , for which political opponents , human rights
After the riots of 7 April , a provisional government was put in place , but for all that , Mr Bakiyev does not seem to have given up , even though he has
You are right , Baroness Ashton; priority must go to re-establishing the rule of law , but we must very quickly go beyond that and , as some of my fellow Members
Yes , we must facilitate economic development and , as you said , especially with regard to education , health but also water , which is an essential priority in this region of the
It is not a case of our interfering in the internal affairs of that country but , on the contrary , of helping the Kyrgyz people to once again trust in
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the situation in Kyrgyzstan is very important for the stability of Central Asia , a region in which Europe has particular interests relating to the supply
Following the unrest of 7 April , it is necessary to re-establish conditions that will lead to the free , legal and rapid election of a democratic regime , if this is compatible
It is worrying that a considerable haul of weapons has been stolen by criminal gangs , with all the risks of increased lawlessness , armed conflicts and terrorism in the area
We cannot pretend , however , that a new constitution or parliamentary regime will be enough to bring about true democracy; this inevitably depends on the political growth of citizens and a
We need to be more present there , cooperating with the UN , USA and OSCE to defend the interests of Kyrgyzstani and EU citizens who are currently unable to protect
Inactivity and hesitancy on the EU's part and an absence of real strategy and tactics may lead to very dangerous developments and undermine the EU's own economic and political
(EL) Mr President , Lady Ashton , in the twenty years that it has been independent , Kyrgyzstan has been governed by a corrupt regime and little progress has been made in improving
The people of Kyrgyzstan are a peace-loving people and I imagine that many of you will have got to know them through the book by the famous author Chingiz Aitmatov ,
However , financial distress and social inequalities , as well as the interventions of foreign countries , have caused explosions which may , on occasion , reach the limits of civil war , and here
As I said , the danger of Kyrgyzstan splitting into North and South is real and is being cultivated by foreign agents , while its membership of the OSCE and the constant
That is why the European Parliament needs to intervene , in liaison with the other institutions of the European Union , with the Commission and the Council , and review the strategy followed
A strong European Parliament delegation must monitor progress in democratisation and grant money in a controlled manner , with a view to developing institutions and education , because the destabilisation of Kyrgyzstan
A proactive approach by the European Union towards Kyrgyzstan is particularly important , but it is equally important that we also maintain a high level of commitment in principle with
Mr President , recent events in Bishkek are alarming and a sad end to the 2005 Tulip Revolution , or Colour Revolution , when President Bakiyev had promised democracy and human rights and
Kyrgyzstan remains the smallest and poorest country in Central Asia and has undergone a worrying infiltration of radical Islamists in the Fergana Valley in recent years , so stability must be
It is right and proper now to recognise the new Otunbayeva government , an unusual example where we have a common interest with that of Russia , which actually supported the revolution
Lastly , Central Asia is a strategic region for reasons of energy and global security and the operational capability of the US air base in Kyrgyzstan is vitally important to support
(RO) Kurmanbek Bakiyev is neither the first , nor will he definitely be the last , political leader to cause disappointment and disillusionment and be treated like a dictator , after the glimmer
None of us should forget that President Bakiyev has exploited the fact that there is a Russian and a US military base on the territory of Kyrgyzstan to continually
The violence is serious and a solution must be found as quickly as possible to put an end to it because , otherwise , it will prevent a process of political
(IT) Mr President , Baroness Ashton , ladies and gentlemen , the situation in Kyrgyzstan is alarming to say the least , especially if we consider the statements made by the former Minister for
One week after the fall of the government of former President Bakiyev , who fled his country by plane on 15 April , no one has any idea about the country's final
What is clear , however , is the role of the Russian Ministry of Defence in facilitating the flight of former President Bakiyev after people took to the streets calling for
The tension is now spreading to neighbouring countries , and the European Union must take note of the priority and the opportunity arising at this time , which is , above all ,
All this , as you said Baroness Ashton , can happen if we are able to make proactive contributions of two kinds: firstly , a diplomatic contribution , but also - as you stated ,
Financial compensation could not meet this need alone , but thanks to the Europeana project , we can help to return to the African peoples part of their culture in terms
Working to digitise works of oral literature , which are often collected by teams of ethnologists and anthropologists , and encouraging free access to them through the Europeana project , thereby making
The honourable Members have made a number of important points and I will try in the short time I have to capture and address as many of them as
Mr Brok , with Mr Tannock and others , talked about the importance of this being one of the poorest countries in Central Asia and , of course , one of the main recipients
Together , the people who have been in the region in the last few days have made this point consistently that we need to see the importance of reform as
There is a strategy for this part of Central Asia , it will be reviewed , but I am looking at it in the context of the External Action Service and
Mr Rinaldi and others too I think rightly described that we need to be cautious , positive and constructive in our attitude and I would agree too with a number
It is core to everything that we will do in the country to make sure that there is indeed the rule of law in operation and that applies in
Mr Lunacek talked about the elections falling - I think that the actual words were used in the briefing I had - significantly short of the standards that we would
And I think the elements which I would put into the mix of things would include financial support , of course , and I have mentioned the rule of law , political
One small example of that , of course , is that it is one of the great water-rich countries in that region , and it provides water to the regions , as honourable
We have been assisting them with their water management for more than five years , and I hope that we will be able to return to that work which is
The importance of democracy , as Mr Provera said , can never be underestimated , in my view; we have got to get beyond some of the issues that Ms Vaidere talked about:
the instability , rumours , insecurities , the issues , which are clearly of enormous importance and , as I have indicated , we have set out what we wanted to do over these first vital
I think that the final thing that I would say is this , that some of the current members of the government in formation are the former human rights defenders on
So , although I do not have any illusions about the nature of politics in this country and , indeed , in the region , I think that we have to try and
give this government a chance to form itself properly , to agree to do the political and constitutional reforms , which are going to be so essential , to hold the elections it
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the popular unrest that has broken out in recent days in the capital of Kyrgyzstan has halted the progress of the 'Tulip Revolution' that kindled
This is not merely because of the country's crucial geostrategic position for Russia and the United States , but also because the stability of Central Asia , its political and economic
We put our faith in the diplomatic mediation that the Presidents of the United States , Russia and Kazakhstan - the latter in his capacity as the current president of
the OSCE - are deploying in their negotiations with the interim Kyrgyz Government for the establishment of public order and constitutional legality , in order that free elections can be held
As Chair of the EU-Central Asia delegation , I hope , even despite the recent ethnic clashes , that we will do everything we can to bring about national peace and the lasting

During the revolution in Kyrgyzstan , the forces which came to power blamed President Bakiyev for restrictions on the free press , violence against journalists , the arrest of opposition leaders , corruption ,

Upcoming EU-US summit and Transatlantic Economic Council - EU-US Data Protection Agreement (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on the following:
Council and Commission statements on the upcoming EU-US summit and the meeting of the Transatlantic Economic Council and
Council and Commission statements on the EU-US data protection agreement
protection of personal data , a subject that has been discussed several times before , including in this House
2008 that was also made available to the European Parliament
The data protection discussed in that report is , of course , a fundamental subject as far as Europe is concerned
It is a fundamental freedom which is enshrined in Article 16 of the treaty , and to which the Presidency attaches particular importance
Therefore , the Presidency supports all initiatives aimed at improving data protection in transatlantic relations and at ensuring an adequate level of such protection
the 2008 Framework Decision
I said we need to achieve an adequate level of data protection , and this must be interpreted as not always being an equivalent or identical one
There must be a high , adequate level of protection of the rights of the individual , but the way in which these rights are guaranteed may differ from country to country
Each system has specific characteristics , including with regard to data protection , and this must not pose a fundamental problem
What is important , however , is that we can guarantee that the civil rights contained in the future agreement are enforceable , and are enforceable in favour of everyone concerned
How will the United States and the European Union guarantee that these rights are enforceable in specific terms
Each party will have to decide this for itself
different ways
Ocean
guaranteed
a kind of inextricable tangle that really hampers the task of the police officers responsible for applying the data protection provisions
The negotiations on these specific agreements are under great time pressure
This was true of the Passenger Name Record (PNR) agreements and of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme (TFTP); you are familiar with the discussions
repeatedly negotiate new sectoral agreements
to eliminate all possible future problems
We should bear in mind , therefore , that it is still possible to conclude additional specific agreements afterwards
Thus , there will have to be what is known as an 'umbrella agreement' , which lays down fundamental rights but does not , in itself , form a basis for data transfer
Data must be transferred on the basis of other existing or future specific agreements
Council meeting on 2 and 3 December next
Thank you for your attention
Member of the Commission
- Mr President , Baroness Ashton could not be with us today so I will cover both the EU-US summit and the Transatlantic Economic Council - often called the TEC
the 21st century
Let me take this opportunity to welcome the active contribution of the European Parliament to EU-US relations and inform Members about our objectives for the summit
The EU and the US are still suffering from the aftermath of the economic crisis
Therefore , the economy and jobs will be at the heart of the summit's discussions
We will start by reviewing relevant results of the G20 summit and will discuss our respective contributions to sustainable and balanced global recovery
We also want the summit to underline the need to conclude an ambitious , comprehensive and balanced agreement in the WTO on the Doha Development Agenda
We will state our joint intent to resist protectionism at home and abroad
We will focus on expanding the economic benefits of the transatlantic economy
As regards the Transatlantic Economic Council , I very much welcome your ideas as expressed in the resolution
the convergence of our approaches
Let me tell you some of my own views on EU-US relations and why I think the TEC is of importance
challenges on a variety of issues , be it innovation or environmental challenges , energy security or access to raw materials
Even if our respective approaches to economic and regulatory issues remain different , consumer safety and data protection illustrate this
What comforts me is our proven ability to work together when times get tough
We pooled our efforts very effectively in fighting the economic and financial crisis; our joint pledge at the G20 and WTO has helped to fend off protectionist moves
increasing competition from emerging economies
The question is: how can reinforced cooperation with the US help us to get there
In my view , both the EU and the US need to rethink and probably redefine the transatlantic partnership to adapt to the new situation
We need to ask ourselves today what the transatlantic market place should look like in 2020
Will the EU and the US be leaders in innovative technologies which have the capacity to transform society , such as electric cars and smart grids
Will they succeed in jointly promoting open ICT services networks and transparent regulation
Will our SMEs prosper and access new markets by protecting their intellectual property rights
Will consumers benefit from information exchanges between the US and the EU on dangerous products
How will we approach security threats and terrorism
By unilateral activism or by relying on more effective and mutually agreed solutions to foster secure trade
How should we approach economic challenges posed by emerging economies in areas including intellectual property rights , access to raw materials or subsidisation of domestic industries
The relaunch of the TEC is an attempt to develop this strategic relationship
With my counterpart , the US Co-Chair of the TEC , Michael Froman , we have agreed to set new directions
We envisage the TEC as the main political platform where we can discuss economic issues , strategic issues - including third country issues - and regulatory issues
existing and potential problems
The next TEC meeting will take place on 17 December in Washington
It should focus on three main themes: innovation and emerging technologies; building the transatlantic market place and building the strategies for greening our economies
On energy policy: the EU-US Energy Council will meet on the eve of the summit; it will continue to work on framing joint responses to energy security
researchers to allow them to participate freely in each other's energy research programmes
This work supports both our efforts on climate change and the creation of new jobs
We are aware of the deep concern amongst our citizens about the impact of the global climate change
At the summit , we will press the US on the need for the Canc√∫n conference to deliver a significant step towards a comprehensive global framework for tackling climate change
On development: the EU and the US are the world's leading aid donors
efforts in the recipient countries so as to maximise the effectiveness and impact of our aid and avoid duplication of effort
all of our work
I know that Viviane Reding will discuss this important issue , including the agreement on passenger name records , with you later today
The EU and the US must also work together in a more comprehensive way to tackle new threats to the global networks , such as cyber effects and cyber crime
Finally , in the foreign policy arena , we will stress our joint strategies and maximise our impact
We must support the Middle East peace process , with the aim of achieving a framework for agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority within a year
On Iran , the EU has delivered on tougher sanctions while , at the same time , being strongly committed to seeking engagement with Iran
So overall , the summit will cover a range of issues that lie at the heart of the transatlantic relationship
I look forward to the debates that will now ensue
Vice-President of the Commission
- Mr President , on 26 May , the Commission recommended that the Council should authorise negotiations on the EU-US data protection agreement and submitted draft negotiation guidelines
This recommendation for a mandate is now being discussed in the Council
to our transatlantic partnership
Sharing relevant information is an essential element of effective cooperation in the fight against crime , not only inside the EU , but also with the US
The EU-US security partnership is very important: it is indispensable and that is why we should allow it to function
In the past , personal data protection has been a recurrent issue
Each time exchange of data across the Atlantic for law enforcement purposes has been discussed , the question has come up again
We believe that an agreement can ease negotiations on specific future agreements involving the sharing of personal data
Such an agreement will also give us the opportunity to build on common ground and to find satisfactory solutions for future cooperation
Let me be very clear on this
We need a general agreement which provides a coherent and legally binding framework in order to protect personal data and to enforce the rights of individuals
We also know that there are currently many specific agreements on data sharing between the US and the Member States , and between the US and the EU
Each of these has its own ad hoc data protection rules
That means a patchwork of different safeguards and provisions for processing personal data
protection is a fundamental right
With your support , I am determined to end this piecemeal approach and to negotiate an umbrella agreement that:
provides a coherent and harmonised set of data protection standards and includes essential principles such as the principle of proportionality , data minimisation , minimal retention periods and purpose limitation;
is applicable to all future and existing agreements dealing with information sharing for law enforcement purposes;
contains all the necessary data protection standards in line with the Union's data protection acquis and suggests enforceable rights for individuals , administrative and judicial redress or a non-discrimination clause;
ensures the effective application of data protection standards and their control by independent public authorities
transatlantic cooperation for law enforcement purposes
I also believe that we need to be ambitious
to prevent terrorism and organised crime
would like to thank those who have spoken here
matters concerning peace and environmental protection - only a joint response by Europe stands a chance of being realised on a global scale
Congress , which play a major role in this context
of SWIFT that parliaments play an important part when it comes to realising this
positive response to the challenges of terrorism , matters relating to Iran and the Middle East , climate change and many other issues besides
We need to make the appropriate efforts here
efforts
growth for us while avoiding unnecessary costs - and also , Mrs Reding , moving forward on matters relating to fundamental rights , data protection and similar issues
It is necessary to ensure data protection , but for a variety of reasons , we also need to have an exchange of data
It is therefore a very good thing that we are attempting to agree on common standards here despite our different legal approaches
with the result that naturally , there are fears concerning inflation and other things and some turbulence in the global economy
It will not help us if exchange rates do not develop correctly relative to each other
Mr President , I would like to add my very warm thanks to the Council and Commission for their introductory remarks
I would particularly like to concentrate on what Mr De Gucht said , because it needs to be noted that the US has changed since 2 November
Not that cooperation with the US was perfect before , but it must be feared that it will now be more difficult
You mentioned protectionism , Mr De Gucht
I believe that we must act jointly to counter protectionism
definitely not in our interests
You referred to energy matters
Today , the Commission published a paper on energy - Energy 2020
While I would criticise some aspects of this , the thinking behind it is along the right lines
However , I cannot imagine that the US will publish a similar paper with similar guidelines
This area will be very difficult , and all the more so since 2 November
You also mentioned electric cars and the matter of developing smart grids jointly with the US , and these are indeed things that we should attempt
At the same time , however , we need to tell the US that we also have other partners
We can also try to develop similar things with China , Brazil or other countries
We need to give the Americans the impression that we are not necessarily reliant on them
We would like to do it with them , but they are not our only partner - particularly when it comes to climate change
Let us bear in mind the behaviour of the US and President Obama's inability to act because laws had not yet been passed
unless we succeed in taking some of these matters further with countries such as China , India or Brazil
We have to acknowledge this fact clearly
I will respond to Mr Brok's comments by saying that initially , there was a great difference , but now there is less difference
It is absolutely right and vital , from our point of view , too , that the US goes back to balancing its budget
us
However , it needs to be done in a coordinated way
The Americans therefore need to get used to accepting greater global cooperation in this area too , particularly cooperation with Europe
on behalf of the ALDE Group
- Mr President , the transatlantic relationship is Europe's most important
law
However , we sometimes seem to either take each other for granted or let our family squabbles obscure our overriding common interests
legislators are full and serious players
That strategic partnership must be rooted in economic and political freedom
I am pleased that MEPs are reiterating our insistence on the aim of a free transatlantic market by 2015
That means gearing up our ambitions for the removal of trade and regulatory barriers
A very large - and growing - part of the transatlantic relationship is about issues of justice , law enforcement and human rights
It used to be ad hoc , now it is really one of the core elements
The more we anchor our partnership in shared respect for our common values , the more strongly we can act to resonate those values in the wider world
years of his Presidency and that made the West both less free and less secure
inquiries
I was very pleased to hear Vice-President Reding on the data protection agreement
It really is vital to have this 'umbrella agreement' , as she called it , because at the moment , we are fire-fighting on each individual data sharing agreement
and squabbles have focused on that subject
It is a great prize worth a lot of effort
pausing for breath
In such a situation , it is all the more important to signal our reliable cooperation and to set clear priorities for our future work together
this matter
We need to breathe new life into the TEC
So far , the TEC has done very little , but we can still hope
for example - but also , above and beyond this , the strategic component
We hope that this is a step forward
It is regrettable that climate policy will not play a part in the one and a half hour summit in Portugal
down by this
but qualified cooperation , by emphasising the Millennium Development Goals and climate policy
independently take the initiative internationally , such as in the Middle East in respect of the Palestinians , Syria or Lebanon
We should tell the Americans quite clearly that we are prepared to do this and that we want to shoulder this responsibility
on behalf of the ECR Group
- Mr President , no bilateral relationship is more important to us than that with the United States
North America to states which do not all share , as yet , our commitments to the rule of law , democracy and human rights
As long as I hold my position in this House I will , of course , fight for unity between the North Atlantic democracies in promoting a common vision for the future
For example , in pursuing our shared goals for security , we should seek the maximum cooperation to avoid unnecessary difficulty
retrospectively applying new legislation to existing legal judgments , both here and in the United States
We must also recognise that the EU does not have legal competence over national governments' own negotiations with third parties
I very much hope that on this , as on so many issues of common concern , we can find a practical and acceptable solution
Mr President , we believe that cooperation should not preclude independence
We believe that the European Union should learn self-respect
We believe that good cooperation presupposes respect for the other side's independence
We believe that dialogue and relations between the European Union and the United States should be conducted in a spirit of mutual understanding and independence
of climate change
We must convince the United States to shoulder its real responsibilities
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to refer back to a passage of Commissioner De Gucht's speech on international development cooperation
We know how important this is in order to reach the Millennium Objectives
improving quality of life in vast areas of the world
The recommendation made in the motion for a resolution to spend 0
7% of industrialised countries' GDP for this purpose by 2015 can therefore be supported , but further measures are essential if the aid is to become effective
Coordination between Europe and the United States on aid policy is needed to avoid overlapping interventions in the various geographical areas
Best practices for the implementation of the plans must be better defined , and they must respect the needs of the recipients , not the donors
a lack of responsibility

This is particularly true of the area of global politics , where the European Union's presence is rather dwarfed

Greater cooperation or coordination with the US is undoubtedly also required in the Transatlantic Economic Council
innovation and development
Finally , we should not forget that improved data protection as well as the maintenance and upholding of citizens' rights should also play an important part at the summit
Mr President , the world's centre of gravity is steadily shifting from the West towards the East , with the emergence of new global powers like China and India
always the case for other strategic partners
From an alliance of necessity during the Cold War , the transatlantic partnership has evolved into an alliance of choice
The emergence of a multi-polar world dictates the need for a new definition of modalities for cooperation between the two sides on all existing bilateral and global issues
partnership based on our respective strengths and specificities
The transatlantic partnership should concentrate on maximising the potential benefits of our economic relationship , with the reinforcement of the Transatlantic Economic Council
Unilateral actions , such as the quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve , are as worrying as the depreciation of the renminbi
now died down somewhat
However , that does not mean that we are back to business as usual
On the contrary
The enhanced competence of the European Parliament in the field of the economy , energy , anti-terrorism and fundamental rights is not business as usual

you requested Commissioner , is not business as usual
Nor is the fact that the European Parliament has opened a Liaison Office with the US Congress business as usual
head , using the new structures being set up
questioning that
done for us is something that can never be repaid
Nonetheless , it also has to be said that you cannot negotiate eye-to-eye if you are constantly bowing
If we , as the European Union , want to have a decent relationship of respect with the US , then it is time we showed some backbone where our positions are concerned
Mrs Reding , you have once again made it clear that you are the right woman in the right post to do that
You mentioned fundamental principles of European data protection law , and I believe we can make no concessions on these in connection with an EU-US data protection agreement
We cannot have a race to the bottom here when we are making an agreement that is primarily aimed at protecting our citizens
Fundamental Rights , the European Convention on Human Rights and the Treaty of Lisbon
European Union
data avoidance and data minimisation
At the same time , when negotiating such an agreement , we must , of course , also make sure that this does not take place in a vacuum

All this must be seen in context
Mrs Reding , I believe that when your mandate is negotiated in the Council on 2 and 3 December , it can be assumed that this House will be behind you
I wish you good luck and every success
We are with you on this
respect of data protection with the US
The intention is to fill the gaps in legal protection and achieve a higher standard of data protection for the citizens of the European Union
Close cooperation with our US partners is necessary and right
However , it must not result in the constitutionally guaranteed rights of European citizens being undermined
The Commission's proposed negotiating mandate for such an agreement is good and points us in the right direction
all the groups in Parliament
From our perspective , it is now urgently necessary that the Council also accepts this proposal , so that the negotiations can commence as soon as possible
I have no doubt that it will not be easy to convince our partner across the Atlantic of our concerns in detail

creating a new basis for even closer cooperation
EU will we gain the trust of our citizens in respect of transatlantic data protection

Mr President , I was in the United States during the mid-term elections and saw something of the political earthquake that took place there
There are lessons for Europeans in this , both in our home countries and in the European Union

Turning to defence matters , the recent UK strategic defence and security review reminds us that Britain's pre-eminent defence and security relationship is with the United States
That should apply to all other European countries
I very much hope that NATO's new strategic concept will demonstrate a revitalised commitment to the alliance which binds the United States to Europe's security
We must not allow the distraction of EU defence ambitions to dilute or undermine this
We cannot afford duplication and distraction , particularly at a time when defence budgets are being slashed
The forthcoming NATO summit on 19 November presents a good opportunity for the 21 NATO allies that are also EU Member States to demonstrate their commitment to the new realities

(NL) Mr President , Turkey's strategic importance to transatlantic relations is obvious
In the light of this , I am very curious to hear the Council's opinion on the new 'Red Book' of the Turkish National Security Council
Logically , this new edition follows the strategy of the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs
the hands of revisionist actors in the region - principally the Islamic Republic of Iran - and is thus actually undermining stability in the Middle East
the EU as a candidate country and also crucial as a NATO partner
reason
Economic theory never tires of telling us that international trade makes the world as a whole richer
It is more reticent about telling us whether or not everybody in every country benefits
The problems that the developed world faces are not too many trade barriers , but too few
That is , too few barriers against products from emerging countries such as China , with its low wage rates , grossly undervalued currency and its artificially impoverished home market
This means that Chinese goods , which are already low priced because of low wages , become artificially lower still because of the low value of its currency
The impoverished home market means that there is negligible demand for consumer imports and even insufficient demand for Chinese goods , making China completely dependent on its export trade
Europe responds to this threat by saying it will become more competitive , perhaps by research and development
This might be a possibility if China respected international intellectual property rights
the price
On the agenda of the EU-US summit will be increasing jobs on both sides of the Atlantic
Some hope of that if we continue to embrace globalism
(ES) Relations between the European Union and the United States are , as has already been said , based on principles , ideas , a shared history and a shared passion for freedom
These values could , however , end up being diluted in rhetoric and languishing if we do not move from words to actions

The upcoming EU-US summit will be a wonderful opportunity to clarify this point and to clearly define what the strategic partnership really is
based on the new approaches introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon
States
The forthcoming European Union-United States summit will take place in a slightly different context
It does not mean , however , that the opportunities are not there
It is simply that the context is a little bit more complicated
I think , therefore , that we will face certain challenges in the preparation of this summit
the European Union
operation
It is also important to try and coordinate our policies on development aid in order to be more effective in this endeavour
On non-proliferation , we should not only keep our capacity to work together but also act in a smart way
Part of this process is the ratification of the new START Treaty , which is still pending in the United States Congress
We hope that the new realities of Congress will not hamper the possibilities for voting for this treaty
The US has announced and has already started the reworking of relations with Russia
Union on the most important global topics
Above all , I hope that during this summit , we can consolidate the European partnership instinct of the United States
We need a functional mechanism for permanent communication , consultation and coordination with our American allies
Mr President , to be a credible partner and to act as a global player , the EU needs to speak with one voice
President Obama and his administration have rightly made this known , and we need to be able to honestly criticise each other like that
This is necessary to ensure a credible transatlantic relationship characterised by complementarity and coordination
freedom while the US is insisting on keeping the negotiations on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) non-transparent , leading to tremendous concerns about Internet freedom
This is contradictory and undermines our credibility
Why do we have to learn through leaked documents that torture was inflicted and condoned in Iraq
We call for an independent inquiry
Why could the Commission not answer my question about requests made by the US Administration with regard to criminal measures against Wikileaks
Does it consider the transatlantic relationship more important than questions from MEPs
Why does the US push European companies to take sanctions beyond those taken by the EU regarding Iran
The US should respect the EU's independence and its complementary role
Both the EU and the US have to work transparently , respect each other's independence and allow for democratic scrutiny of our actions
Is it not that which distinguishes us - the US and the EU - from others , most notably with regard to fundamental freedoms and human rights
democracy - but there are also some things that divide us , namely , how these rights are applied and put in concrete terms when it comes to transatlantic relations
In particular , this contradiction repeatedly comes very clearly to the fore in respect of security issues
Data protection is a source of constant misunderstanding; we have long known that
Consequently , the framework agreement - if we succeed in bringing about a very good one - will be a great step forward
We need to find a solution here that also enables citizens on both sides of the Atlantic to assert their rights in respect of the other partner
A second important area in which our principles are similar but our approaches diverge considerably is the area of climate change
I would therefore very much like to see this on the agenda and being clearly discussed
We cannot allow the European Union to use the transatlantic dialogue to weaken its own promises and commitments
(PL) Mr President , one of the fundamental principles of cooperation in the European Union is the freedom of movement of people

During the summit , the matter of the equal treatment of EU Member States in the visa waiver programme should be made a priority
This will be the first test of the effectiveness of the President of the European Council , Mr Van Rompuy
on the occasion of the NATO summit which will be under way
Taking a strong line on the visa issue will show whether the US is treating the Union seriously as an entity recognised by international law
(EL) Mr President , we support the joint motion for a resolution by the political groups
We do , of course , need to debate the issues before the EU-US summit and before the G20 summit
The United States are our natural allies
However , an alliance means equality and there can therefore only be a true alliance where relations are set on an equal footing
exchange , and this must be done on an equal and mutual footing , as Mrs Reding said
Within this framework , of course , global drug trafficking and the threat which it represents to international policy , security and stability , has been overlooked
We also need to cooperate on efforts towards crisis management and conflict resolution and the development of third countries
However , whereas Europe basically supports the development of third countries , the United States does not
If we want real balance , development and security issues need to be divided between the United States and Europe within the framework of international action in general
(DE) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would simply like to make three brief points , on behalf also of some of my colleagues on the Committee on Transport and Tourism
These are critical points that I would ask the representatives of the Commission to bring up in their discussions
The first is that although it has already been passed , the travel promotion tax is an unacceptable unilateral decision by the US Government
We hope that you can persuade it to think again on this
allowed to continue
they are one-sided and disproportionate
The costs are out of all proportion to the benefit and it is unreasonable to expect this of European ports and enterprises
(BG) Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , since President Obama has assumed office , relations between the European Union and the United States have entered a new era of stable cooperation
other countries towards a lasting , binding agreement on combating global climate change
Time is of the essence
Kyoto runs out in two years , but we need certainty and time to adapt
We must give a clear signal to developing countries by providing cooperation in the transfer of technology and suitable financial support
down at the negotiating table and will lead the way in the efforts to achieve a new agreement guaranteeing the safety of future generations
(DE) Mr President , the United States and Europe are the West's companions in fate
crisis is likely to begin in emerging countries such as Brazil , India and China , where there remain considerable and discriminatory trade barriers as well as non-tariff barriers to trade
to their trade relations with third countries
realise that this will not be without its problems
WTO negotiations
Moreover - and I expect the US shares this desire - we would like to see the Doha Development Round being concluded as quickly as possible
However , it will be necessary not just for us to make new and substantive proposals , but also for the emerging economies to move towards us
Here , too , a common strategy by the US and the European Union would be beneficial to both sides
Washington works together in the area of trade policy
four EU Member States whose citizens are still subject to this travel restriction; namely , Romania , Bulgaria , Poland and Cyprus
Union
I believe that this nit-picking over technical details concerning admission to the visa waiver programme must be opposed more firmly and effectively by the European Union's representatives
It is the European Union's duty to display , as a whole , a more active and clearer show of solidarity with all of the Member States' citizens
importance in the current economic and geostrategic climate
(FR) Mr President , no one can seriously give an assurance , in this House , that the measures taken on both sides of the Atlantic will prevent a future financial crisis
fight against tax havens
My second point is that everyone can see that we are completely interdependent in terms of finance , economy and currency
That is why any decision taken unilaterally , without consultation , is not going in the right direction
I am , of course , thinking about the European Development Fund's (EDF) action a few days ago
We have to move forward together in order to reform , for example , the international monetary system
We also have to take action together to make international institutions more balanced , more transparent and more democratic
If we want Europe's voice to be heard on the major issues , however , it really has to take the initiative and to speak with one voice
That is what we will demonstrate in a few hours , for example , at the G20 summit; at least , I very much hope so
(ES) Mr President , the Union's most important strategic relationship is the one it has with the United States
We must maintain a continuous dialogue on bilateral issues and also on global issues , and try to ensure the most coordinated action possible
In my view , this is the main message of tomorrow's resolution
I therefore regretted the fact that the planned summit in May was not held
Moreover , I found the argument given at the time that there was no agenda to be absurd
climate change , energy security or nuclear proliferation
action by the United States and the European Union
I hope that the forthcoming Lisbon summit will be a success
There are many issues to tackle , some of which I have already mentioned
Moreover , the world is changing
Asia is in the ascendancy; let us think about the importance of China or India , which President Obama has just visited
There is even talk of a post-Western world
In this context of a changing world order , we need close coordination between Europe and the United States
We have many interests , ideals and values in common
We will be stronger if we act in a coordinated way
Ladies and gentlemen , the Treaty of Lisbon has also created new bodies to strengthen the Union's role in the world
We should therefore also improve our mechanisms for dialogue and coordination with the United States
The resolution adopted by Parliament in March last year contains many ideas as to how to strengthen those institutional mechanisms for dialogue between Brussels and Washington
the summit , about which we heard nothing
Unfortunately , the Commission did so only very briefly
Who really came here to talk about the summit
(DE) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , international terrorism is undoubtedly something that we must fight together; that is beyond dispute
proclaimed by former US President George W
Bush in his book and on talk shows
I mention that also in view of the new majorities in the US Congress
clear , which is that the song of freedom cannot be played on an instrument of violence
We cannot tell people in other countries what we expect of the rule of law if we do not jointly uphold the same standards and act accordingly
I am very pleased , however , that President Obama has brought a breath of fresh air into the US , even if his position may appear to have been weakened somewhat recently
One thing is clear , and that is that we will be on the side of those who defend this rule of law
(IT) (The speaker begins speaking with the microphone turned off)
by which the new powerhouses of the world move , in my view , the transatlantic area still remains the most developed and efficient economic area on the planet
It is true that there is a widespread and - in many ways understandable - rush to a commercial agreement , for example , with countries like China
more than any other , we must take care to hold dear and guard almost jealously
This consideration is a result of the histories of both Europe and the United States
Indeed , it is demonstrated by the common love of democracy , peace , rights and the market economy
structure , which is therefore more free
I therefore appeal to those managing the European Union's foreign policy at this time
Over the years , we have noted how the abilities of the US leadership - whoever the President was - have always had an enormous role in global transatlantic decisions
It is time for us , too , to take the situation in hand
on a single seat for the European Union at the United Nations
(RO) I welcome the EU-US data protection agreement , which must be supported in order to strengthen cooperation in the areas of combating crime and terrorism
protection which Europeans will enjoy within the United States
an independent authority will be guaranteed
(PT) The world is experiencing some very difficult times
In such difficult times , we should have no doubt as to who is our ally and who is our enemy
The United States is one of Europe's key allies
at safeguarding the values of civilisation , which we want to defend
protection , the protection of personal rights and the right to privacy
The prevention , investigation and prosecution of crimes cannot happen at the expense of the disregard for and violation of individual rights
Neither Europe nor the US would allow this to happen
US in the light of this common goal
Mr President , I would like to welcome the Transatlantic Economic Council on 15 December , and especially its discussion of innovation , the digital agenda and energy technologies
In the last couple of years , we have seen how difficult it is to harmonise existing legislation and even approaches on moderated industries and services
This is therefore a great opportunity to shape our legislation in these new fields where there is no legislation as yet
These new fields are precisely what we are talking about; new challenges , like ageing society or climate change , require further development in the legislation for the enabling technologies
Finally , Commissioner , it is high time to talk about energy security and think about the Transatlantic Energy Council for the future
I wish you good luck for your meeting on 15 December
deepening of trade ties , nuclear proliferation and the fight against terrorism
The economic recovery , however , has to be issue number one on the agenda
The transatlantic economic relationship is vital to global prosperity as the bilateral trade of our two economies represents almost USD 4
3 trillion
Our economic partnership is a key driver of global economic prosperity and represents the largest , most integrated and longest lasting economic relationship in the world
Together , our economies account for half of the global economy
stimulus packages , and strategies to curb currency manipulation of other major global economies
On the other hand , we should reconsider whether holding biannual EU-US summits is a good idea
President Obama's decision not to attend the previous summit in Madrid earlier this year exposed the excessive EU synergy
By insisting on frequent bilateral summits , we risk devaluing them to the extent that they will become irrelevant
(FR) Mr President , Commissioners , I would like to come back to the anti-counterfeiting agreement which is currently being negotiated , in particular , with the United States
This agreement raises some questions also for the United States , particularly among the officials from the US Patents Office
Furthermore , 75 US law professors have recently sent a letter to President Obama
They consider that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) , which is a simple executive agreement , would be contrary to the US constitution
support among our fellow citizens , I think that it would be useful for us to have a very clear response from the US negotiators on two points
Can ACTA be ratified by the United States
In their opinion , is ACTA a binding or a voluntary agreement
Indeed , an anti-counterfeiting agreement that does not include China , India and Brazil , and which would not be implemented by the United States , would be seriously lacking in credibility
Thank you
Mr President , I would like to thank Commissioners De Gucht and Reding for their intense but realistic approach to the EU-US summit
I think it is time to recognise that the US can accomplish none of its strategic goals without Europe
Similarly , the EU cannot play its intended role as a world player without close cooperation with America
The paradox is that globalisation and the rise of non-Western powers give the US and EU more , rather than fewer , reasons to intensify their cooperation
At the same time , we see that the transatlantic gap is expanding , not narrowing
Europe occupies a smaller role in current American plans and concerns
Therefore , it is crucial to recognise that time and opportunities for strengthening mutual partnership are limited
condition that they act together
This has to start with completing the Transatlantic Free Trade Area , which the European Parliament has advocated for several years , overcoming internal divisions in Europe and opposing protectionism
Mr President , I would like to speak about the general framework agreement on data protection that Ms Reding has started to negotiate
Hardly a week goes by without us hearing about a new terrorist attack or attempted attack , and this is obviously harmful to the well-being of our citizens
We need an efficient tool to combat terrorism
This is one obvious area where we can cooperate with our friends across the Atlantic
There is clearly an urgent need for this framework agreement on data protection
Ms Reding , you have our support on this agreement
Of course , we want this agreement , not only to fight against terrorism but also because we have concerns about data protection
We would like you to protect the privacy of our citizens and to protect the principles of necessity and proportionality in particular
This is not a zero-sum game
We do not think that there is a choice between our security and our privacy; we think that we can actually secure both
in securing a deal which is good for our citizens , a deal guaranteeing both our security and our privacy
his predecessor , relations between Europe and America would be normalised
It seemed that the times when Washington acted unilaterally in the international arena were coming to an end
ensure economic security
We know , today , that this was a vain hope
making a unilateral decision to print money
Despite the numerous promises made to the representatives of European governments , they have made this decision without any kind of consultation
Acting in their own particular interests , they have decided on measures which will adversely affect the European economy
The upcoming EU-US summit should be used to express our disapproval and to appeal to be treated as partners
Cooperation is not only in our interest , but is also in Washington's interest , particularly in view of the new geopolitical order which is emerging
of narrow-minded egotism
However , there are some very important topics under discussion and we must resolve these important topics together with our US partner
The November summit will be the first meeting between the US and the EU since the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force
In view of the fact that the European Union and the US represent half of the global economy , one very important topic will be the economy
the like
the rest of the world , but to act in a way that is appropriate for two responsible , leading global powers
In addition to the November summit of the EU and the US , the December meeting of the Transatlantic Economic Council also provides a platform for responsible and pragmatic policies
the Transatlantic Economic Council
I was in Washington in July on a mission as Chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection
both working on , and particularly to work around the basis of standards which my committee has been doing a lot of work on over the last few months
What we should be doing is creating the common standards for future technologies , not creating new trade barriers by working independently
States
I think that this element of your announcement today is very important
to take this forward
transatlantic legislators' dialogue because we have new challenges to meet
(DE) Mr President , I refer to the data protection agreement and would like to point out that all existing agreements absolutely must comply with European data protection standards
This applies not just to the agreement on the forwarding of banking data , but also in the area of Passenger Name Data
The Commission cannot deviate from this position when negotiating the data protection agreement with the US
We cannot allow EU standards to be tailored to those of the US
minimal retention periods and the right of EU citizens to effective legal remedies in respect of data processing
data of EU citizens
Notwithstanding this , an agreement without adequate guarantees would have no chance of standing up in the European Court of Justice
of the delegation in December
less secure as a result of American policy rather than more secure
point the finger at America
particular that we were regarded - as some thought - as weaklings
That cannot happen again , particularly in issues such as quantitative easing
We have to assert ourselves and have our voices heard
guarantee of security in order for our cooperation to succeed
We must eliminate all the problems here , within the European Union
Visa requirements for citizens of four countries that form part of the 27 Member States is a serious limitation of freedom
Last week , a delegation from Parliament put this problem to the Canadian authorities and it seems that they will take it upon themselves to deal with it
and we also noted a careful attitude in Canada towards the US and Mexican markets
Interacting with the United States on climate change , for sustainable energy and for the global market , is a good start to the talks
(DE) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I refer to the data protection agreement
and updated in accordance with this new framework agreement
That is the real purpose of the agreement that we are working towards here
As I see it , the risk of legal uncertainty comes if we did not do this
After all , our highest priority must be to protect our citizens
Member of the Commission
- Mr President , let me first answer a number of specific questions which have been put , and start with climate change
The new majority in the US House of Representatives is likely to limit President Obama's room for manoeuvre even further
16 meeting in Canc√∫n
In the meantime , we can advance on concrete issues , such as fast-start finance , reduce emissions from deforestation , and facilitate adaptation to climate change for poor and developing countries
These can proceed without US domestic legislation , as can biological research work on clean technologies
not admitted to this programme
We attach much importance to their admission and we will continue working with our US counterparts on resolving this issue
commitment of the US to facilitate transatlantic mobility and that they constitute an additional burden for European citizens travelling to the US
We need to make sure that work on security issues , such as PNR , goes hand in hand with facilitating transatlantic travel for legitimate travellers
Regarding the question on the Wikileaks documents , we are unable to comment on the information contained in the leaks at present
However , as a matter of principle , the EU is firmly committed to upholding the absolute prohibition of torture and cruel , inhumane and degrading treatment
This is all we can say at this moment in time
There was a question from Ms Quisthoudt on the possibility of a free trade agreement with the US
and exports would grow by 2
1% and 6
1% respectively if half of the non-tariff measures and regulatory differences were removed
In fact , there are not that many tariffs any more between the US and the EU
we adopt regulations in important areas , in particular , emerging markets and new technologies
the input from advisers
The main themes we are looking at are innovation and emerging technologies , and strategies for greening our economies and building the transatlantic market place
standards and the overall approach to regulation , the Innovation Action Partnership and exchange of information on consumer product safety
We will also discuss joint responses to economic challenges
Furthermore , at the end of November , as was asked by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , I will discuss standards
I believe the precise date is 29 November
The last question was on the 100% scanning of inbound container freight
port
We believe that this requirement will not bring proven security benefits and will be a barrier to smooth trade
For these reasons , the Commission does not envisage the implementation of 100% scanning in EU ports
The US Homeland Security Secretary , Janet Napolitano , has announced plans to push back the July 2012 deadline for 100% scanning by two additional years
The Commission is hopeful that this delay will lead the US Congress to review its policy and favour a risk-based approach to supply chain security
by accelerating reforms , building an area of freedom , justice and security , and pulling our weight on the global stage
We have a number of important tasks ahead as we look to the forthcoming EU-US summit and beyond
are building with emerging powers such as China , India , Russia and Brazil
On the economy , jobs and growth are at the heart of the discussion
We will compare notes on the G20 results , especially financial and banking reforms and the need to deliver a global trade deal , and look for EU-US added value there
At the same time , we need to focus more on delivering the full potential of the transatlantic market
My aim will be to refocus the TEC on a transatlantic agenda for jobs , growth and innovation
With the support of the EU-US Senate leaders , I will look to move forward on that at the forthcoming TEC meeting on 17 December
Vice-President of the Commission
agreement on data protection
of citizens to data protection
Trying to achieve both in equilibrium will be the content of those negotiations
As I have already told you , on 26 May this year , the Commission put forward a proposal for a negotiation mandate
We are looking now to the Council to have this mandate agreed upon , hopefully at the beginning of December , so that we can start with real negotiations
I absolutely agree with what has been said in this House
agreement'
If we , the United States and Europe , manage to set common standards , then those common standards will sooner or later become world standards
very clearly put on the transatlantic agenda
The question of individuals' rights in such an agreement has also been raised
place of residence , and compensation for any damages suffered
to strike a balance between rights and security and also , at least in my view , not to allow any discrimination on racial grounds
In order not to allow this , the Commission will certainly need the help of Parliament
I have heard that you want to establish , or you have already established , specific new bilateral relations between Parliament and the United States Congress
be of much help in the course of the negotiations
next stage will be 2 and 3 December
and the negotiations can really begin
matter; an opportunity , indeed , to translate an explicit request from the European Parliament into a solid framework agreement
the specific details , on the enforceable aspect of the rights , continues to develop in such a way that feedback is given
I hope , therefore , that the Commission will achieve good results in the short term - hopefully after the Council meeting on 2 and 3 December
Thank you for this debate
I have received four motions for resolutionstabled in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure
The debate is closed
The vote will take place on Thursday , 11 November 2010
Written statements (Rule 149)
The EU and US form the largest trade partnership , accounting for half of the global economy
in recent years by the economic crisis
In this respect , the Transatlantic Economic Council remains the most suitable mechanism for achieving the objective of establishing a unified transatlantic market by 2015
I believe that during the Lisbon summit , the priority topic of the visa regime applying to all Member States must be discussed
of action
regarding visa applications
This IT system will improve controls at Romania's borders and the EU's external borders
This is a necessary step with the prospect of accession to the Schengen area
States on the basis of individual bilateral agreements
I am fully aware of the difficulties inherent to the signing of this agreement , since there are fairly different approaches to data protection on either side of the Atlantic
Treaty of Lisbon
life in the country's constitution
There is much to be done with respect to access to data and their rectification , to reciprocity , to legal protection , and to independent supervision
progress that is so urgently needed , as well as the resulting transposition of these results into the respective bodies of legislation as quickly as possible
First of all , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the splendid job he has done
Cooperation in Europe
human dimension , have been incorporated into the report , and that the report managed to draw attention to the role of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities
The task and responsibility of the High Commissioner is particularly important in promoting the peaceful coexistence of national minorities and the prevention of potential minority and ethnic conflicts
absence of any means of enforcement
For years now , one significant yardstick by which to measure relations between the EU and the United States has been climate policy
It is with reference to this that images of the United States as a unilateral actor that goes it alone have been strengthened
It is time , however , that we reviewed this image
It is true that the United States distanced itself from the frontline of climate policy when it refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol
Nevertheless , time has shown that the whole agreement is ineffective and the wrong way to resolve the complex problem of climate change
is a lot more promising and which has opened up new horizons
It is now time the EU realised what is happening
The United States is not going to embark on any emissions trading scheme
Not long ago , Obama said that it was most important to do the right thing , which , of course , is useful , whatever we might think about climate change
These useful acts include investing in clean energy and improving energy selfsufficiency
Of emissions trading , Obama said that it was a means , not an end , and that there were other ways to 'skin the cat'
Is Europe now the bogeyman of climate policy , who does not appreciate the situation or learn from his mistakes
We take jobs abroad and raise energy prices; we do everything the hard way instead of taking sensible action
We should prevent pollution , in the same way that we should also invest in clean energy and focus on energy selfsufficiency and afforestation
Emissions trading , in contrast , is not worth our support
It was marketed to us as a way to prepare for an international scheme , which never came
Why do we continue to use it to torment our citizens , by depriving them of work and a livelihood
The forthcoming EU-US summit will certainly confirm the exceptional importance of these relations
not be allowed to diminish
For this reason , it is important to approach such negotiations with maximum openness , which is an essential prerequisite for the operational character of the forthcoming meetings

It is therefore essential that the EU clearly declares itself in favour of looking for global currencies other than the US dollar
It is important that the Union insists on its role as a pioneer of ecological technology and legislation , and accordingly puts pressure on both the US Government and Congress
Obama on global nuclear disarmament and on the ratification of the new START Treaty , which was signed by the Russian and US Presidents this year in Prague
and issues of defusing flashpoints of international conflicts
This is significant capital and this line must be pursued
Unfortunately , some things have yet to be implemented in order to achieve common transatlantic goals
A large part of US society is opposed to actions combating climate change
An ambitious bill on limiting greenhouse gas emissions is still stuck in the Senate
There is no movement forward on the issue of the abolition of the death penalty which is important to the EU
The EU-US summit will take place next month in Lisbon
I hope that the EU will be able to convince its partner , the USA , to continue to make progress towards the common goals mentioned
It is also important to increasingly include Russia in the transatlantic dialogue
general and common legal framework must also be drawn up to protect personal data
This framework must provide for protection equivalent to that enjoyed by European citizens within the Union
The Commission's negotiating mandate is therefore heading in the right direction
With regard to the sphere of application , this legal framework must also apply to existing bilateral agreements
Parliament will have the final word on the future agreement
of which was to enable Europe to concentrate more on relations with third countries
The forthcoming summit will provide us with an opportunity to outline a framework for transatlantic cooperation over the next few years

The next climate summit in Canc√∫n is approaching
I hope that the United States will demonstrate a greater level of commitment when it comes to joint obligations in the fight against climate change
As a significant player in the international arena , we should set an example to other countries

It is self-evident that what is needed is cooperation at global level
Congress
More intensive dialogue will be advantageous to both sides
Mr President , Mrs Reding , Commissioner , honourable Members , as you know , the debate on the cooperation between the United States and the EU has been ongoing for some time now and ,
notably , we received a Commission proposal on 28 May 2010 requesting approval for the opening of negotiations on an agreement between the European Union and the United States on the
At the same time , the Commission has been acting on the work of the EU-US High-Level Contact Group on Data Protection and Data Sharing , which drew up a report in
This agreement should take account of the data protection principles laid down in various documents: the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union , the 1995 Data Protection Directive and
We take the view that , in the same way that a European directive can be transposed differently by different Member States , an international agreement can also be transposed in
Yet what matters to everyone at all events is the end result: having rights that are enforceable in favour of the parties concerned on both sides of the Atlantic
Since the Council shares Parliament's concern on this point , it will make a request , in its decision authorising the opening of negotiations , for the Commission to submit a report to
the Council in the course of those negotiations , focusing , in particular , on the specific question as to how the specific enforceability of rights laid down in the agreement will be
Sectoral agreements have already been concluded in the past , with specific data protection arrangements that were different for each sector; and , at present , the differing provisions of these agreements form
Thus , when it comes to the forthcoming comprehensive data protection agreement in which the data protection principles are to be enshrined , we must try to avoid the need to
On the other hand , we must also be realistic and understand that a single comprehensive agreement with the United States in the field of data protection will never be able
By way of conclusion , therefore , Mr President , I should like to emphasise that the Presidency is striving to have the negotiating mandate for this comprehensive agreement dealt with at the
same time as the three mandates for the PNR agreements with Australia , Canada and the United States , and that we should very much like to discuss the matter at the
As you know , the summit will take place in Lisbon on 20 November; it needs to demonstrate the added value of the EU-US partnership and its continued relevance in
I would like to underline three elements in particular: the importance of strengthening the strategic components of the Transatlantic Economic Council; the need for the TEC to support and foster
cooperation on all matters affecting the regulatory environment for industries and consumers in the EU and the US; and the crucial role of legislators in becoming guardians and actors in
The EU and the US are the world's most integrated economies; we are each other's largest trade and investment partners; we share common values and responsibilities for tackling global
Two years on , the EU and the US are now moving towards the next phase: the creation of smart and sustainable growth and jobs while facing serious challenges and
In advising the Commission and the US Administration , legislators , businesses and consumers have provided and should continue to provide crucial input and come up with possible transatlantic solutions to
Our intention is that the summit should ask the Energy Council to intensify EU-US cooperation on the development and deployment of green energy technologies and promote exchanges between our
As well as working on implementing millennium development goals on food security and helping the poorest countries adapt to climate change , we need to work closely on coordinating our
On security: recognising that fundamental rights and the security of citizens are complementary and mutually reinforcing; we need to ensure that there is a good balance between the two in
I know that the European Parliament shares my view: this is a unique opportunity , an opportunity to reach a high level of personal data protection , while bringing new dynamism
We thus have a solution which is far from satisfactory , and which is hardly justifiable since we are talking about a fundamental right - and the right to data
I believe that citizens and businesses alike expect a single set of legally binding data protection standards , which will then be applied uniformly across the Union , as well as to
I am determined to pursue my objectives and I am confident that I can count on the support of the European Parliament in order to achieve a good agreement with
the US , an agreement which will ensure a high level of data protection for all individuals and allow us to pursue the necessary and important cooperation with the United States
Mr President , Mr De Clerck , Mrs Reding , Mr De Gucht , ladies and gentlemen , the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) supports the joint motion for a resolution and
We must understand - ahead of the EU-US summit and now , as the G20 summit takes place - that on many issues - not just economic issues , but also in
For this reason , we would like to have closer cooperation here and , as the European Parliament , are also endeavouring to achieve this with the new majorities in the US
Mr De Gucht realises this in the case of the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) , Mrs Reding in the case of data protection , and we also saw in the case
Together , the Europeans and Americans - who still account for 60% of the world's gross domestic product - have a chance to lay down such standards and give a
I therefore hope that we can move forward on these general political matters and that progress will be made in the TEC , which has been revived by Mr De Gucht's
I hope that the original objective can be realised there so that we can remove trade barriers to arrive at a transatlantic market , which could generate a lot of
If you will allow me to make a further comment , in this instance on matters relating to financial markets , it must of course be said that while legislation has been
passed to ensure that the events of two years ago cannot be repeated , the Fed has now , for example , decided to place USD 600 million on the market without consultation ,
It may provide a solution for one area or another in the short term , but overall , it is no solution because it results in competitive protectionism that is quite
Now , with the current majorities in Congress , the law is not even on the table - with the result that we must assume that things will be more difficult
I have nothing against that; on the contrary , it is a good thing if the US tries to create new jobs again - good for America , and good for
Not only do we still account for half of the global economy , but our democracies are the key drivers of the maintenance of human rights and the rule of
That is why our joint resolution insists on the importance of a strategic partnership , one which stresses coordination and cooperation in meeting global challenges and regional issues and in which
In that context , the renewed justification by former President George Bush of water boarding - which is unequivocally torture - sums up everything that went wrong in the disastrous eight
The emerging , widespread evidence of apparent mistreatment of Iraqi detainees by UK and US troops demands examination at the highest level , including at the forthcoming summit and in independent
If we could just have a settlement , a framework in which individual data sharing requests can be examined , that would be extremely valuable because so much of our attention
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the elections of 2 November represent a fairly major turning point in recent American history and one gets the impression that the country is now
I am grateful to Mr De Gucht for bringing up the subject of the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) at the start of his remarks and for what he said on
I also agree with and support the two aspects that you mentioned , Commissioner; both bilateral cooperation - with a view to the standardisation and regulation of low carbon technologies ,
Nevertheless , it is important that our representatives , President Barroso and President Van Rompuy , make it clear there that Europe will not allow itself to be held back or dragged
The focus on development policy is a good thing , and from a European perspective , it would also be good if we could seek to achieve not just any cooperation ,
Finally , in view of the fact that the Presidency has now been weakened and that there are new isolationist tendencies in the US , it will be important for Europe to
We face an uncertain century ahead , which will be characterised by a fundamental shift in the global economic balance of power away from the liberal democracies of Europe and
I therefore applaud the work that is being done on the data protection framework and the PNR agreements , but I would urge caution when considering the potentially serious consequences of
Of the very serious issues which I wanted to comment on , therefore , I would highlight the following as issues which are primarily our responsibility: the need to put real pressure
on Israel to resolve the Palestinian question and on Turkey to resolve the Cyprus question , the urgent need to abolish the death penalty in the United States , the fact that
President Obama has broken his promise to close the Guant√°namo base , the need to defend - and I use the term advisedly - personal data and , finally , the massive issue
Reducing inequalities between rich and poor countries does not only meet a moral requirement , but also contributes to resolving the motives for international conflict and disputes as well as
Good governance in countries benefiting from the aid policy is essential to increase the effectiveness of the intervention and avoid the dispersion of precious resources through corruption , incapability and
For example , in agriculture and fishing , it makes no sense to fund economic development plans with one hand and close the door on products from developing countries with the
(DE) Mr President , the coming months will show what the effects will be of the weakening of President Obama in his own country as a result of the relatively poor
I am thinking , for example , of whether protectionist tendencies will increase and influence trade and economic policy , or whether President Obama will turn his attention more towards foreign policy
For Europe , and for the EU in particular , this should only be of limited interest , because the EU needs to be able to define its own emphases and objectives , and
As everybody knows , on all the relevant issues - whether it is Iran , Afghanistan or the conflict in the Middle East - we tend to sail in the lee
Yet in areas where greater cooperation with the US would be appropriate - such as in resolving the Cyprus problem , where the US could influence its ally Turkey -
Although President Obama appears to be more interested in the Pacific than in the Atlantic , from our perspective , we need to place greater focus on Eastern Europe and the
There is no doubt that the West - in other words , Europe and the US - should maintain its position as the global leader in the areas of research ,
In this new context , while the EU remains the first commercial power in the world and the US continues to be the first commercial partner of the EU , our
cooperation is much more than that: it is a core element of the international system as it is based on common values , historic ties and strategic interests , which is not

(EL) Mr President , the explosion of interest in the European Parliament on the part of the United States in the wake of the rejection of the initial Swift agreement has
The current feeling in the United States that the European Parliament counts , for which we need to congratulate Mr Kennard , the American Ambassador in Brussels , is not business as
The fact that we have vital and crucial negotiations before us on issues such as those raised by Mrs Reding , on which the European Parliament supports the Commission , as
It is perhaps a good thing that the initial hoo-hah has abated , because we can develop a really strong long-term relationship between the European Parliament and Congress with a clear

The US is one of our most important trading partners and one of our main allies , and as a German , I am acutely aware that what the US has
Such protection - the protection of personal data and the safeguarding of privacy - is laid down in a multitude of ways in articles contained in the Charter of
The aim of an EU-US data protection agreement must be to realise this; to uphold and not water down the measures that we have taken and implemented in the

As rapporteur for the European Parliament , it is a pleasure for me to take this opportunity to assure the Commission that the present draft has the broad support of
I am convinced , however , that the United States was founded on the principles of freedom , democracy and fundamental rights and shares our respect for individual rights in relation to
It is therefore not an impossibility , nor a matter for conflict; rather , there is a realistic possibility of reinforcing our common ground on both sides of the Atlantic and
I should like to conclude , however , by mentioning one more aspect that is particularly important to us as Parliament: only when we succeed in creating a uniform framework within the
It is therefore of the utmost importance that the data protection agreement with the US represents a framework for all agreements made by the EU and by the Member
As such , I am looking forward to my work as rapporteur in connection with the data protection agreement with the United States and to cooperating closely with my fellow
Citizens both in the United States and here want less government intrusion in their lives , control of the deficit and cuts in public expenditure , and for us that should
(PT) It is time to urge the US to work towards the peaceful resolution of conflicts , to end military occupation and war , whether it be in Iraq , Afghanistan or the
Middle East , to end the embargo on Cuba , to stop supporting the aggressive policies of Israel , which are responsible for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the occupied Palestinian territories ,
It needs to be made clear that the pretext of the fight against terrorism cannot continue to be used to undermine international law and respect for human rights and fundamental
This summit coincides with the NATO summit in Lisbon , which wishes to revise its strategy , and in which the US is seeking a commitment from its EU allies to a
military escalation at a global level , with the aim of securing resource exploitation , market control and political dominance through the threat of military force , which increases the dangers and threats
We would therefore like to show our solidarity with the struggle of the peace movement , with the workers' struggle and with the many organisations which are building up the
My first question to the Council , with the forthcoming transatlantic summit in mind , is as follows: does the Council share the fear that current Turkish foreign policy is playing into
My second question is whether , indeed , the Council intends to raise the subject of the Red Book at the transatlantic summit , in view of Turkey's position as being crucial to
Mr President , on the agenda of the TEC meeting in December will be removing trade barriers , which is a sacred aim among globalists that owes more to faith than to

Here , there has been talk of the importance of economic and trade relations , and 15 EU Member States alone invest more in Texas than the 50 US States invest in
We need to give new impetus to the summit mechanisms , create a Euro-American Assembly and , most importantly , create a coordination and consultation mechanism for global issues and the most crucial
Mr President , during President Obama's recent tour of the Middle East , we heard him say that they saw their most important partnership as being that between the United States and
This reminded me of one of the fundamental aspects of Mr Mill√°n Mon's report , in which he recalled President Obama saying in Berlin that Europe was the most important
We could start by asking the United States to support the European Union in its demands to have an institutional presence , for example , in the United Nations General Assembly ,
Mr President , not so long ago , this Parliament adopted a resolution which spoke about the new possibilities for developing transatlantic relations after the election of President Obama in the United

We have to insist on the development of the civilian dimension of the peace enforcement and peace keeping missions , as well as of the crisis management and post-crisis rehabilitation
I think this reworking is very important to us and it is also important , if we look forward , for a trilateral dialogue: Russia , the United States and the European
How can we work together on defending human rights , the rule of law and democracy in this world when Hillary Clinton gives a speech on a vision for global Internet

In its capacity as an entity recognised by international law , the reformed Union strives for the equal treatment of all citizens , which includes the freedom to travel throughout the
In anticipation of the forthcoming European Union-US summit , it needs to be reiterated that out of 27 Member States , four , including Poland , are still subject to a restrictive visa
We will find out , too , if the talks with President Barack Obama are treated as the beginning of specific dialogue or if they prove to be a courtesy meeting
We need to engage in closer , institutionalised cooperation , primarily in order to promote global democracy and human rights , a society of knowledge and science , global security and stability and data
Secondly , the exclusion of Romania , Poland , Bulgaria and Cyprus from the visa waiver programme is something that the European Parliament cannot endorse , and , in our opinion , it should not be
Thirdly , we welcome the joint efforts to elaborate international security standards and to develop smart security concepts , but unilateral stipulations such as compulsory container scanning are not a solution because
The summit in Canc√∫n , which will be starting in a fortnight , will provide a fine opportunity for the US and Europe to adopt the same stance and lead the

We are convinced that the Transatlantic Economic Council not only can , but indeed must , play an important part in promoting a joint approach by the Economic Union and the US
We urge this Transatlantic Economic Council to work towards a common approach and a common strategy for new free trade agreements by the US and the EU , although I
Furthermore , such harmonisation between the US and the EU is urgently and rightly being demanded by industry in the context of the G8 and G20 , as well as in

There is always an agenda between two partners that are so important and which are immersed in a global economic crisis , and when there are challenges such as terrorism ,
Moreover , there are major regional conflicts , for example , the Middle East peace process , the Iranian nuclear challenge or the issue of Afghanistan , which , in my view , are worthy of coordinated
My final comment is that I regret the fact that the representative of the Council only referred to an exchange of data; he did not come here to talk about
However , we must fight it on the basis of our common values and the rule of law , not based on the very individual interpretations of the law currently being
The decisive thing for us is that we advance the level of data protection , that we respect our citizens' rights; for there is one thing that must also be made
However , I believe we must not forget the fact that the existing relationship between Europe and the United States has , for a very long time , been the link that ,
Acceleration of the process of strengthening transatlantic economic integration is indeed indispensable in order to promote global development based on a combination of values whose stated aim is to
reach an acceptable standard of living for all people of the world , following a fair and effective policy of multilateralism which contributes to the construction of a more democratic global
We derive strength from the will of 500 million people and from a new and more solid institutional structure that must give us the ability to abandon the temptation
to hide behind the American giant and instead take the destiny of our people into our own hands , perhaps asking our friends in the United States to state their position
As the European Parliament has stated on frequent occasions , the lack of US data protection legislation which is compatible with European legislation raises serious question marks over the actual
In this context , I would like to ask the Commission and Council what guarantees will actually be given in practice concerning the rights of Europeans to lodge judicial and administrative
appeals , as well as proportionality in terms of the various US authorities and agencies processing and accessing data and , last but not least , how supervision of the entire process by
Terrorism is being fought on a global scale against entities who do not even have a face both inside and outside our common area , and this fight is aimed
Yet the pre-eminence of these values that we wish to defend also means that in Parliament , the Commission and the Council , we can and should demand clear rules on data
Once again emphasising the critical importance of transatlantic relations and good cooperation at all levels between Europe and the US , we should therefore support negotiations for a future global
agreement which sets out rules , safeguards rights and , on a reciprocal basis , does not demand any less from the US than what we are also prepared to concede to the

While the European Parliament , as you know , is about to adopt a resolution on the ACTA Agreement , and this is still causing considerable disquiet and is far from finding unanimous
Probably during the next 10 years , the US and EU will have a chance to set an international agenda providing for a value-based and stable world , but only on

Mr President , as a member of the EU-US delegation , I take a special interest in the forthcoming summit and I am looking forward to going to the US as part
It is fair to say that the US is our natural ally and , for that reason , I would dispute the statement made here this evening that the world is
If we want to point the finger , we should look at countries where there is no freedom , where there is no democracy , and where terrorists are harboured , before we
Having said that , it is important that we approach further meetings and summits with the US as equals because that is what they will respect; We saw in Copenhagen in
(IT) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen of the Commission and the Council , ladies and gentlemen , relations between the European Union and the United States must be based on the maximum
Trade with the United States is important , as it strengthens our euro and puts the European Union in a position to compete with the great Chinese , Japanese and Indian markets ,
For me , there is no question that , following the conclusion of a data protection agreement , the existing agreements between the US and the EU will need to be checked
We need to make sure that the US does not back-track on its Copenhagen commitments and we must encourage them to contribute to a successful outcome of the COP
There was also a question on the US visa waiver programme and the fact that a number of EU Member States - Bulgaria , Cyprus , Poland and Romania - are still
In relation to the introduction of the ESTA fee for travellers under the visa waiver programme , the Commission has repeatedly voiced concern that these new requirements are inconsistent with the
We are not considering this at this moment in time , Ms Quisthoudt , because , as regards the EU-US trade relationship , an earlier study conducted by DG Trade on non-tariff measures
shows that non-tariff barriers remain the major obstacle in EU-US trade relations and concludes that the GDP of the EU and the US would increase by about EUR 160 billion
That said , existing barriers are often very difficult to remove but this is precisely why , in the TEC , we are pushing for early and upstream cooperation , for example , before
Regarding the TEC and what its agenda might be , we are currently working with our US counterparts to fix the final agenda for the next TEC meeting , bearing in mind
Under these themes , we will have opportunities to discuss a wide range of issues including e-health , the interoperability of electronic health records , secure trade , mutual recognition of authorised trade
We are concerned about the US requirements that , by July 2012 , all US-bound maritime containers will have to be scanned before being placed on a vessel at a foreign
The main challenges for the EU over the next year suggest many synergies and opportunities for cooperation with the US: dealing with the economic crisis; governance , restoring growth and jobs
One of them is building a more open and outward-looking EU-US relationship that would take into account the full scope of relations that both the EU and the US
- Madam President , after the remarks of my colleague Karel De Gucht on the general agreement and relations with the United States , let me concentrate on the future umbrella
It is very clear that we need to share data in order to fight terrorism and organised crime and , at the same time , we need to preserve the rights
We need to concentrate on legal security in an umbrella agreement instead of - and I quote a Member of this Parliament - 'fire-fighting on each individual data sharing
We have to show that those standards are built on our values of justice and fundamental rights and of the right to reciprocity , both of which have to be
What the Commission has put on the table would mean the following for our European citizens and for the citizens in the United States: enforceable rights for individuals , such
as the right to access personal data that has been collected about them and the right to rectify and erase this data , administrative and judicial redress , regardless of nationality or
The effective application of these rights would be ensured by the monitoring and controlling of these data protection standards by independent public authorities and , in this context , a non-discrimination clause
should also be included to ensure that all personal data is protected regardless of a person's nationality or place of residence , bearing in mind , at all times , that we need
I think that this will also be very important in order to raise understanding of such data protection agreements on both sides of the Atlantic , so here , you could
Madam President , I can be very brief , as I , of course , concur with the words of Commission Vice-President Reding , namely , that it has been a good debate and that the
The Council does indeed hope to be able to finalise the mandate then , so that the Commission will be able to start the debate in earnest at long last
This represents an opportunity to improve cooperation between the EU and the United States; an opportunity to strike a balance between security and privacy; an opportunity to unite fragmented subject
I presume that today's debate has equipped the Council to endorse the Commission's negotiating mandate , assuming that the Commission also provides feedback at appropriate intervals and that the debate on
On the other hand , both partners must cooperate more closely to promote growth and employment in their own economies , especially as 30 million jobs have been wiped out worldwide
As freedom of movement is a highly valued right in the EU , the Commission must continue the political and technical dialogue on the progress made and on future courses
I should mention that the Romanian Government has recently approved a legislative framework for setting up a national visa information system , facilitating the exchange of data with other Member States
The signing of an expanded agreement with the United States on data protection is essential and urgently needed; it will prevent these issues from being dealt with by the Member
In the EU , the right to the protection of personal data is explicitly established in both Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 16 of the

Since President Barack Obama triumphed in the elections two years ago , the positions of the EU and the USA have converged significantly , in particular , as regards disarmament , combating climate change ,

Deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (implementing powers conferred on the Commission) (vote)
- Report: Gyula Hegyi
- Before the vote:
rapporteur
I would like to inform you about the basic elements of the new legislation on GMOs
The compromise package gives Parliament the right to control the deliberate release of GMOs
Parliamentary control means transparency on this sensitive issue
simply do not want GMO food
That is why our greatest success is that the Council and the Commission have agreed to Parliamentary control of the implementation of the labelling requirements of GMOs
I wish to thank the shadow rapporteurs , the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency
Having greater openness on genetically modified organisms makes Europe more democratic
- Mr President , I do not want to steal my colleagues' time , but as we did not have a plenary debate and we have reached the first reading discussion ,
The Eurobarometer opinion poll showed that , with regard to GMOs , 94% of our citizens want the right to choose , 86% want to know more before consuming GMOs and 71%

The organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities (debate)
European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2002/15/EC on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities - C6-0354/2008 -
rapporteur
- (HU) The proposal put forward is intended to amend Directive 2002/15/EC in connection with social protection
support for the application of the law
The directive itself and , hence , its amendment , are supplementary in nature and only apply to vehicles over 3
5 tonnes , like other laws applicable to road transport activities
Therefore , it could not extend to drivers of smaller commercial vehicles
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs voted against the amendment (30 to 19 votes)
Several misapprehensions arose while the law was being drafted
I would like to address a few of those which may have influenced MEPs
will not improve road safety
only 0
06% of cases
Also , driving time , which has a real effect on road safety , is regulated by a different act of law , Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 , which also applies to self-employed hauliers
100 km
Secondly , trade unions fear that self-employed hauliers could even work up to 86 hours if they are not regulated
The regulation includes stringent rules on driving time
It is capped at 45 hours per week for any two consecutive weeks , not to exceed 56 hours in any single week
This is accurately recorded by digital tachographs and the regulation also includes detailed rules on rest periods
Therefore , the claim of a possible 86-hour working week is an assumption not supported by any statistical data , study or survey
Thirdly , the Commission's proposal would limit the scope of the directive to employees and false self-employed hauliers
So far , there has been no law regulating the working time of self-employed entrepreneurs
Working time restriction is an important means for the social protection of employees
However , in the case of self-employed hauliers , the employer and the employee are the same person , and protecting private transporters from themselves is an extreme measure
Fourthly , when the arguments run out , the real reason is revealed: social dumping
States
My experience is , unfortunately , that the case of the phantom Polish plumber has returned to haunt us
field of road transport
This is the issue of false self-employed entrepreneurs , which is a real European problem with adverse effects on competition and the labour market
This is the issue that needs to be addressed , and this expectation was stated clearly in the proposed amendment
for their support
We will vote on the amendment section by section
I would like to add one more thing
As a compromise solution , we recommend allowing each Member State to extend the scope of the directive to self-employed hauliers , if they want to
Vice-President of the Commission
- Madam President , today , this House is discussing an extremely difficult and sensitive subject
The question is whether or not entrepreneurs who are self-employed drivers should be covered by the directive on the working time of mobile workers
The inclusion of entrepreneurs would be a precedent and a clear deviation from the general Working Time Directive
This directive only regulates the working time of employed workers , not of entrepreneurs
Discussions about the inclusion of self-employed drivers have been going on for a long time
Firstly , consultations between social partners in the 1990s did not yield any result
Then , the legislator could not reach a conclusion after four years of discussion - between 1998 and 2002 - and therefore asked the Commission for a thorough impact study
as road safety or competition conditions , but that enforcement in respect of the non self-employed is a real issue
This is also the sense of the Commission proposal
Firstly , I wish to express my deep respect for your rapporteur , Mrs Bauer , who has done an excellent job
appreciate Mrs Bauer's constructive proposals
I believe that the rapporteur's proposed amendments have the potential to protect employees even better against possible exploitation by employers
company which gives them orders and pays them
will be vigilant in putting this rule into practice throughout Europe
As regards road safety , let me stress that working time must not be mistaken for driving time
The situation regarding the latter has radically changed since 1998
As you know , this House , together with the Council , adopted new driving time rules , introduced modern , reliable digital recording equipment and adopted a specific directive on enforcement
Today's debate is not on road safety
The statistics and the studies that the Commission has made available to Parliament give absolutely no indication that the inclusion of self-employed drivers would improve road safety
small and fragile undertakings which have managed to survive the economic recession
Instead of imposing red tape on entrepreneurs , Europe needs a working time directive which will really ensure protection to those employed and dependent drivers who need that protection
(FR) Madam President , my point of order concerns the code of conduct adopted by this Parliament in terms of ordinary legislative procedure negotiations
mandate from the appropriate committee to negotiate what you are calling a sound agreement
Commissioner , you are flouting the operating rules of this institution
That gives us the right to raise the issue of how the institution to which you belong operates
That was not a point of order
You are listed as a speaker later in the debate
recent months
The fundamental issue is whether or not the working hours of self-employed workers in the transport sector should be regulated for the first time
The Commission says not , nearly all the Member States say not , and the majority of my group also says not
If we were to include self-employed drivers in the directive , it would only serve the interests of big business
We need to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises , however
tightened up
All drivers - whether self-employed or employees - must take a minimum of 11 hours rest over a 24-hour period
That is why we have digital tachographs that automatically record driving hours , and the authorities monitor compliance with this
I was the European Parliament's rapporteur on tachographs at the time
I am grateful to Mrs Bauer for preventing the regulation being extended to vehicles weighing less than 3
5 tonnes
Digital EU control devices in all commercial vehicles would have resulted in time-consuming and expensive documentation obligations
We want to reduce bureaucracy , not increase it
I therefore recommend that this House support the compromise that the rapporteur has reached with other groups
on behalf of the S&D Group
self-employed and independent drivers
vote tomorrow , just as it was in plenary last spring and in the Employment Committee this March
We very much regret the confusion the rapporteur appears to have encountered in discharging her mandate
Council
Employment Committee recommendation to the plenary: the rejection of the Commission's proposal
Madam President , a tired driver is a dangerous driver , irrespective of employment status; we should not make road travel any more of a gamble than it already is
Once again this morning , the rapporteur has shown confusion between the notions of driving time and working time
one week is enough of a danger in itself
If the Commissioner doubts that figure , he can come to see me any time he likes; I have the figures from the people working in the sector
This is a fact
We must reject the Commission's proposal
on behalf of the ALDE Group
- Madam President , first of all , I want to thank the rapporteur Mrs Bauer for her hard work
The core issue we are dealing with here in this report is whether to include , or exclude , self-employed drivers from the Working Time Directive
periods
Therefore , road safety matters are dealt with adequately under that directive , and , if anybody believes that they are not , then we need to look at the Driving Time Directive
There is no data relating accidents to the working time of professional drivers and no data distinguishing between employed and self-employed drivers
Therefore , we have no data on a decision to include self-employed drivers
and is not based on any reliable data
This legislation , if it includes self-employed , will be virtually unenforceable
job under way
According to the legislation , working time includes when a self-employed person is at their work station
This is defined in the legislation as the main place of business of the undertaking , together with its various subsidiary places of business
legislation
Yes , there are issues relating to competition for self-employed , but this legislation will not deal with those matters
In fact , in my own country , we deal very effectively with this matter through the tax system
Finally , if we reject the Commission proposal , we will end up with bad law
own country , Ireland
It is unenforceable , and that makes an ass of the law
social Europe with fair competition and decent working conditions
Or will we allow the market and the laws of chance to reign in a transport industry that is coming more and more under pressure
For us in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs here in Parliament , there is no doubt at all
We want self-employed drivers to be included in the Working Time Directive
Thus , we reject the Commission's proposal to exclude self-employed drivers , for the following three reasons
Firstly , self-employed drivers need to be covered by working time regulations so that we can ensure traffic safety in Europe
With a lorry weighing a tonne behind them , it is absolutely essential to put a limit on their working time to avoid tired drivers and accidents
Secondly , we want to ensure fair competition within the transport industry
In recent years , we have seen an enormous growth in the number of 'false' self-employed drivers
This has been the industry's solution to avoid the working time regulations
As legislators , we must not create incentives for there to be more self-employed drivers in Europe
Instead , we must ensure that there are uniform rules so that we create a level playing field
Thirdly , we want to ensure a good working environment for everyone
From EU studies , we know that self-employed drivers are sick more often and are more stressed than employed drivers
Is this a reasonable state of affairs from the point of view of health and safety
We do not think so
A great deal has been said about this directive , and many incorrect things have been said
I would like to dispel two myths
Firstly , there is the myth concerning administrative work
Office work does not form part of the regulation , and it is very important to establish that fact
We should bury this myth
Secondly , there is the myth concerning enforcement
I have heard my fellow Members say that it would not be possible to enforce this directive
To these Members , I would simply say that we have a digital tachograph that can provide the measurements
It currently does this for employed drivers , so clearly it can also do so for self-employed drivers
Finally , I would just like to say a few words to Mrs Bauer
As shadow rapporteur for the Greens , I have been very disappointed in how the process has been carried out recently
Mrs Bauer broke all the good rules of negotiation , she broke the 'code of conduct' of this House and now she is presenting what she calls a compromise
As far as I am concerned , this is her responsibility - it is not a compromise that is valid for Parliament
It is her filthy proposal that she has produced with the Council by skirting all of the rules
conditions in an increasingly pressurised transport industry
This is something that I hope everyone in Parliament will support when we vote tomorrow
Madam President , some of my fellow Members claim that compliance with the 48-hour working week serves the interests of self-employed drivers and of road safety
This is a dirty campaign , as self-employed drivers continue to be covered by the Regulation on driving times and rest periods in any case
There is absolutely no threat to road safety
The problem is that some southern European trade unions fear that self-employed Romanian and Bulgarian drivers will take all the business
Those Members follow the trade unions like quivering lapdogs
That is the heart of the matter
Mr Kallas , the Commissioner for Transport , wishes to exclude self-employed drivers from the scope of the directive
He deserves our support in tomorrow's votes
If he fails to obtain it , 16 June will be a dark day in the history of the European Parliament
It will kick citizens when they are down and give them piles of red tape on top
And then we complain that voter turnout falls further with every new election
Madam President , once again we are in a debate that is crucial for protecting the rights of road transport workers and road safety
The Commission's insistence since October 2008 on changing the 2002 directive is unacceptable
increased to intolerable levels simply to allow greater profits for the major employers in the sector
As an example , so-called self-employed drivers could end up working up to 86 hours per week over the whole year
This would not only jeopardise their health and safety , but would also present a danger to the safety of all other road users
It would also encourage social dumping and the deregulation of employment due to the increased numbers of drivers who falsely state that they are self-employed
Affairs had never been made
That is why we are now in this very serious situation
This issue needs to be clearly opposed by a majority in Parliament , but this has already been jeopardised by the Commissioner
We advocate rejecting the proposal , so as to prevent the continuation of this grave threat to workers' rights and the safety of all road users in the European Union
social dumping , protect the right to health and rest for workers in the sector , and improve road safety conditions
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we are planning to extend this directive to self-employed drivers for the sake of a supposed increase in safety
However , the arguments put forward are misleading and will have a detrimental effect
by the economic crisis , is at risk
statists , who are ready to place a new , dangerous burden on businesses , and the supporters of the human face of Europe , who are in touch with our citizens' real needs
By intervening to legislate on the organisation of self-employed drivers' working time , Parliament would be setting a dangerous precedent , authorising a European-branded takeover of entrepreneurship and free enterprise
It is time to put our words into practice
Let us stop exploiting small and medium-sized enterprises for our own ends
EU bureaucracy wants to reassert its strength
I oppose the utopian war of principles with practicality
Europe must not encroach on the sphere of private enterprise and must respect the requests of our regions
report
I am outraged by the way this proposal runs counter to the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises by introducing , from this day forward , unfair competition from false self-employed drivers
This report introduces the practice of unfair competition and will allow it to develop with the growth in the number of false self-employed drivers
This proposal also runs counter to the interests of employees
At the very time when we are all working together to build a social Europe , this report reinforces social dumping between Member States
It is against the interests of employees , it is against the interests of Europe
In short , this report flies in the face of road safety
I presided over a region crossed by heavy traffic from all over Europe , with significant accidents which gave rise to legal actions
These serious accidents should not escape our attention
We shall have to account for our decision to our fellow citizens
Court rejected their appeal on the grounds of road safety
Finally , what we need is a European regulation between all Member States because , nowadays , transport is a European matter
The vote in committee was clear
I hope that it will be just as clear in plenary
in which Parliament was not respected and for the way that you are presenting this debate here today , which is very economical with the truth
It is not true , Commissioner , that this is about including self-employed drivers: they have already been included since 2009
It is you who wish to remove the self-employed from the directive
Nor is it true , Commissioner , that we are not talking about health and safety on the road: that is exactly what we are talking about , Commissioner
talking about and here you are wheeling out false arguments
As always , you are adducing bureaucracy
It is not true
You have been singing the praises of the tachograph and the great strides that its use has caused in the regulation of driving in Europe
It can be applied without any need for bureaucracy
What you are doing is putting the economic interests of the few above the rights of the majority; that is what is really happening
Once again , you are disproving what you say about people coming before business: business comes before people for you
I wish to record our protest here and I hope that Parliament once again says that the public , safety , law and truth are what is most important
I protest , Commissioner: I am very disappointed
Mrs Bauer , I am very disappointed with the way in which you have carried out this debate and this negotiation
(DE) Madam President , we have heard a great deal already
It is true , as Mrs Figueiredo said , that this is a directive that was intended to be aimed at employees
That is correct
However , there are also self-employed people who are not classed as employees
It is important for people in Europe to be able to decide how they want to work - whether as an employee or as a self-employed worker
That is only right
Naturally , the self-employed also have to play by certain rules
Digital tachographs are already present in all heavy goods vehicles and the equivalent vehicles that we are talking about here
If we were now to include self-employed workers in this directive , it would unduly restrict their freedom of choice
That is why my group is in favour of excluding the self-employed from this directive at all costs
We consider Mrs Bauer's proposal , and the proposal from the Commission , to be right
That should be taken into account
We want to protect small and medium-sized businesses , and in this case , we can do so by adopting the proposal
(DE) Madam President , the previous speaker described an ideal world in which drivers themselves decide whether they want to be self-employed or employees
Unfortunately , in reality , drivers no longer have this choice; instead , they are generally being pushed into being self-employed - or at least , ostensibly self-employed
is being presented as a general compromise and which does not give consideration to this issue , then we are playing into the hands of social dumping in Europe
Go and have a look at what is happening on the roads by visiting a checkpoint
Take a look at what is really going on in this sector
Go and have a look at the accidents - then you will realise that , as Members of the European Parliament , we cannot allow ourselves to advocate social dumping
Madam President , it is vital that self-employed workers remain free of the clutches of the Working Time Directive in this way
it is a choice that people make
The only thing bogus in all these discussions is the scaremongering claims of people saying that there are road safety dangers associated here
We talk here endlessly about promoting entrepreneurs; we talk about allowing them to flourish in the European Union
We are here actively encouraging small businesses , and to discourage them simply cannot be the way forward
So I would urge you to vote with Edit Bauer
(DE) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we have been debating the matter of driving time and working hours in road transport for months
I am beginning to wonder what the next argument will be to try to show that everything we have been debating for months is complete nonsense
The latest argument is that we have to change something urgently so that nothing changes
Mrs Bauer , can you not see how absurd this argument has become - how riddled it is with lies and half-truths
What we are debating here is nothing other than extending the working hours of self-employed workers
However , for more than 150 years , it has been a principle of legislation on working hours that people are protected from working excessively long hours
That applies to the self-employed just as much as to those in employment
It makes no difference whether it is a self-employed worker who is pushing himself too hard or an employer that is pushing an employee driver too hard
It is about protecting people from themselves and from excessively long working hours , as well as in part from employers and others who commission work
As a second point , on the matter of road safety , it has been asserted here that nothing can be done in this respect
Ladies and gentlemen , we are not amateurs or volunteers
We cannot pass laws on the basis of 'Let's see what happens'
Everyone knows that working excessive hours increases the risk of accidents , particularly in road transport , where the consequences are so serious
My third point is to ask who would police this proposed differentiated regulation on our roads
Our judges already find it difficult to decide whether someone is self-employed or only ostensibly self-employed without long study of the evidence
Let us abandon this nonsense
This is about fair competition
It is not about setting a precedent this morning for future debate on extending working hours
Do not play games like that with this House
Madam President , it is essential that Amendment 30 , with special regard to paragraph 7(a) , be adopted
Self-employed drivers would not then be included in these provisions
It is not a road safety issue
All drivers are limited to driving times and associated work monitored by the tachograph
Including the self-employed drivers will penalise them , especially those who do not use an agency
Company drivers have their schedule provided , but true independents spend time preparing their own schedules and bidding for new business
compared to the commercially employed drivers
Thus , business will be lost and unemployment caused in the small business sector
the workforce
I therefore support the rapporteur in Amendment 30 as well as the Commission in this respect
You do not hear that very often from this part of the House
in my country , who have expressly requested the inclusion of the self-employed in this directive
We believe that there are several reasons for their inclusion
are directly related to a road transport operation
Secondly , for reasons of fair competition , as bringing back discrimination between self-employed and employed workers will distort both the labour market and the transport market
Finally , it also seems inappropriate to me that each Member State should be able to apply the provisions of the directive to drivers if it so wishes
There needs to be a general rule for the entire EU , since the majority of hauliers work outside their own countries; without it , fair competition would be impeded
(FR) Madam President , just for once , I will speak about procedure
and the conditions for free and undistorted competition
some new proposals to make
Those new proposals were never referred to the relevant parliamentary committee for its consideration
Moreover , Mrs Bauer's report was rejected by more members of that committee than had rejected the previous report
Mrs Bauer had no mandate to negotiate , on behalf of this Parliament , a first-reading agreement with the Council
The Commission and the Council have knowingly flouted the operating rules between the institutions
Mrs Bauer has flouted the code of conduct of this institution
This Parliament questions at times the nature of a first-reading agreement because it reduces our ability to negotiate
Now , in this instance , if Mrs Bauer's amendments are approved , there will be a first-reading agreement that has not been examined by the bodies of this Parliament
intelligence
I request , as a minimum , that Mrs Bauer's proposals , which have never been examined in committee , be referred back to committee for consideration
(NL) Madam President , I support the Commissioner
Self-employed workers organise their own working hours , and that is the way it should stay
There is a difference between self-employed and employed workers , and that is only right and proper
This has nothing to do with road safety , as driving times and rest periods are identical whether the worker is self-employed or employed
These are monitored by a tachograph , which is intended for that and no other purpose
We do not look beyond this to monitor the road safety situation of employed and self-employed workers
monitor this
How do you propose to drop in on self-employed workers and ask when , where and how much they have worked
This kind of monitoring system would not be feasible and would subsequently be considered unacceptable
We should not be making such legislation; we should not be including self-employed workers in the scope of the directive concerning employed workers
(FI) Madam President , I come from Finland , where there are few people , distances are long and there are a lot of self-employed people
We do not need , will not tolerate and will not put up with extra restrictions on self-employed drivers
I am glad that the Estonian Commissioner , who is familiar with conditions in the northern countries , knows this , and that also applies to the Slovakian rapporteur
I want to thank you for that
This is an important question of principle
We cannot place restrictions on small business that apply to Europe as a whole
This may be a precedent and it is very dangerous
How does Europe think it will achieve growth and employment if its administrative decisions destroy employment and the preconditions for growth and kill them off
I am on the side of Finnish owner drivers and in this case , that also means on the side of small business entrepreneurs all over Europe
After all , there will be no growth or increased prosperity in Europe if administrative decisions prevent small business entrepreneurs from working
(Applause)
(FI) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , there must not , under any circumstances , be any restrictions put on the working time of self-employed drivers other than on their driving time
pertaining to road transport and driving times and rest periods in force , and that applies to all - yes all - lorry and bus drivers , including self-employed ones
times of the self-employed
Now there is a move to include such jobs as cleaning the vehicle , technical maintenance and completing consignment sheets in the restrictions on the working hours of self-employed drivers
How can we check whether a self-employed driver is washing his wife's car or his truck in his own backyard
This is quite incomprehensible , because there are no restrictions on the working hours of other entrepreneurs
It would be a serious precedent if we went down that route
one or two vehicles
Restrictions on the working hours of entrepreneurs would favour large , supranational transport companies and would make it difficult for new transport firms to start up in business
The sector will certainly not be of interest to the young if we start to restrict artificially the potential to make a living
It would mean a dearth of capacity and increased costs
Already , logistical costs are , on average , higher in the Nordic countries than in the rest of Europe on account of our northern location and sparse population
(Applause)
(NL) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I shall get straight to the heart of the matter , namely the issue of self-employed workers
A reminder that the scope has covered all self-employed drivers since March of last year would certainly not go amiss
That is the present state of affairs; that is the point of departure the rapporteur should have taken into account
Consequently , this is not the precedent the Commissioner claimed it to be
and keeping red tape to an absolute minimum
As the rapporteur from the Committee on Transport and Tourism knows , I had drawn up a number of proposals
time for a number of other activities , such as administrative tasks and also cleaning and similar operations
She also knows quite well that activities such as customer contact are neither subject to monitoring nor counted as working time in any case
Therefore , I regret that neither the Commission nor the rapporteur was willing to take account of this in any way whatsoever
The proposal to let Member States decide for themselves whether or not self-employed workers should fall within the scope does not strike me as a good one
The objective must be to arrive at common , uniform ground rules at European level so that the same rules apply to all
in the scope of the directive
This optional arrangement is unacceptable and in conflict with EU competition rules
of their EU counterparts who are not subject to the same rules
of competition
Businesses could , in fact , use self-employed workers more , as they are able to offer their services on a more flexible basis and at a lower cost
road traffic risks
improves the working environment nor protects workers' health and safety
our utmost to regularise this sector without jeopardising European competitiveness
However , there is disagreement about whether we should involve the self-employed in all of this
I believe we should not arrogate to ourselves the competence to regulate the way they use their time
this sector
this when we have a crisis on our hands which is having a negative impact on all European sectors
I therefore congratulate Mrs Bauer for her report and for the compromises she has recommended
I would like to appeal to all of us to be careful when we come to regulating the self-employed themselves
competition
These are the words of the Commission itself when the directive was introduced on 23 March 2005
Since then , the Commission has done a U-turn and submitted a proposal that excludes self-employed workers
That sets a precedent and I cannot defend such a policy
There are various reasons not to support the proposal which , in my eyes , represents a step backward socially , a reduction in road safety and an incentive for unfair competition
Neither has the proposal been designed to support small and medium-sized enterprises
To me , this U-turn demonstrates an inability to implement European policy
the European Court of Justice , the directive - European law - is simply being amended and steered towards a point where economic interests are the only thing that count
Madam President , as a former self-employed truck driver , I support keeping the self-employed in this directive
Own-account drivers , I know for a fact , are under tremendous pressure to work night and day
Commissioner Kallas , your speech and your proposal is a disgrace
It puts drivers' health and safety at risk
It puts other road users at risk
It puts SMEs at risk from unfair competition , and it puts increased pressure on decent employers to push their employees into self-employment
Fifty per cent of drivers have admitted falling asleep at the wheel
Twenty per cent of accidents are due to fatigue
Thirty per cent of drivers' working time is taken up loading and unloading and helping passengers
Ms Harkin , if you are still here , what they do in their attic is their own business
This Parliament must stand up for citizens' safety and against those who want an unregulated transport sector
Commissioner Kallas , go back to the drawing board
(DE) Madam President , I would like to agree with Mrs Morin-Chartier
road safety and that this concerns an existing directive on working hours and rest times
Do we want to suddenly call into question a common European regulation on road safety
Why would we do that
It would be absurd and incomprehensible
hours loading and unloading
As a result , they would become a menace on the roads
I certainly would not like to encounter such drivers on the roads of Europe
How can we suddenly start promoting the distortion of competition at the expense of our common health
How could we explain that to our citizens
That is why I urge you to reject the Commission proposal
improvement in their professional image
drivers , be they employed or self-employed; rather , it is about the regulation of working hours
safety
There is no need to protect the self-employed from themselves
How would we check the hours worked by self-employed HGV and bus drivers without a huge amount of bureaucracy , and on what basis would we be checking this anyway
out the wrong signal
Instead , the Member States should be working to combat the problem of ostensible self-employment among drivers
I am in favour of the proposal put by the European Commission and Mrs Bauer
Madam President , extending the Working Time Directive to cover self-employed people is nonsensical
It is window-dressed to protect employees' rights and therefore has no place in a self-employed framework
It is also unenforceable without infringing people's liberties by carrying out checks in their homes
This is not a matter of road safety
Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 already covers driving time and is applicable to large companies , small businesses and the self-employed
You still need an operator's licence to work if you are self-employed and would therefore be the registered holder of that licence
Anything which may jeopardise the licence would therefore jeopardise the licence holder's whole livelihood
With this in mind , it is safe to assume that there is just cause for self-employed drivers to be even more fastidious than big firms
Everything directly related to the service would be considered part of working time; for example , paperwork , maintenance and general administration
In large firms , people are employed to do this; therefore , administration time has no impact on driving time
Self-employed doing their own administration would find , under the directive's conditions , little time left to do the driving itself
As an aside , I believe the Commission also proposed a relaxation of restrictions over night work by introducing a two-hour qualifying period before night-time restrictions apply
I rarely agree with the Commission but this would also be a welcome amendment
I fully support the rapporteur , Ms Bauer
safety of the people of Europe
the responsible way for Europe to act
Tomorrow's vote is an opportunity to show that you are not in favour of social dumping
What this debate has also shown in recent months is that a debate on ostensible self-employment in Europe is long overdue
for what we can do about it
As the Commissioner stated quite clearly today , we have had many declarations of intent on this matter
It is time to act at last
(PL) I would like to ask: how can entrepreneurship be stimulated during a crisis
How can a growth in the numbers of small and medium-sized enterprises be stimulated
restricts that entrepreneurship
After all , if people want to start up on their own in business , including the transport business , they should have the right to do so
We must not treat them , on the one hand , as businesspeople and , on the other , say that they have to comply with criteria designed for employees
We could do the same to people who run a restaurant , on their own and with their family , or for people who run a shop
We must not confuse these two things
There is a certain excess of legislation , and the European Parliament also contributes to this
I know that , in Poland , we had the best regulations on economic activity at the beginning of the 1990s
Now we have increased the number of these regulatory burdens , and the result is that this is meeting with criticism
From whom
From the people who are running a business
I endorse what Mrs Bauer says , although I am not , of course , going into the questions which came up when this compromise was being negotiated
restricting the right to work of self-employed lorry drivers
I have to say that I reject as utterly bogus the claims in this House this morning that this is about health and safety
We are all concerned about health and safety and do not want to see any more accidents on our roads
I represent Northern Ireland
It is right on the edge of Europe
The road transport industry is hugely important to the economy and the inclusion of self-employed lorry drivers will only have a negative impact on competitiveness
It is an industry that is highly regulated through tachograph rules , and the financial implications of further red tape would be devastating
It would also be hugely damaging to those hoping to set up as independent drivers
Committee
If the European Parliament is serious about creating growth and wealth , then we Members must reject the Commission proposal
Self-employed drivers must not be excluded from the Working Time Directive
This would be a backwards step , since the same rules must apply to self-employed bus drivers and long-distance lorry drivers as to the employees of enterprises
It cannot be our aim to have fewer and fewer people working more and more - and generally for less and less money
It cannot be our objective to have bus drivers and long-distance lorry drivers jeopardise their own health as well as the safety of other road users
the debt crisis if we work more
It is entirely unnecessary to burden the self-employed with yet more bureaucracy and paperwork
Quite simply , if we are to be able to ensure social security in Europe , then it is very important that we increase productivity and competitiveness
Consequently , the driving times and rest times currently guaranteed by tachographs are entirely sufficient
- and then not to use their cars on Thursday evening when they go home after working here for 15 hours
Ensuring safety is important but , on the other hand , we must also protect the self-employed
Vice-President of the Commission
- Madam President , thank you very much for this debate
I listened with great interest to all your contributions
still confirm the Commission position , which is built on facts
like to enforce , will harmonise practices between Member States and will fulfil this task to ensure and improve road safety
Road safety has improved very largely due to the use of the Driving Time Directive
care about road safety or about their own health , so they must be more regulated than others
similar working time restrictions
Parliament decides to include self-employed drivers in this directive , we will enforce your will
We will immediately inquire with Member States how they apply the working time rules on self-employed drivers and how they monitor compliance with these rules
rapporteur
- (HU) I would like to address five matters very briefly
The Rules of Procedure
they want
According to the Rules of Procedure , the parliamentary committee does not require MEPs to voice the committee's position
It is the plenary session's position that is binding
That is exactly what the Rules of Procedure say
it consulted
In agreement with the shadow rapporteurs , I also had informal discussions with representatives of the Commission and the Council when I thought it was important
the exclusion of self-employed entrepreneurs important
This issue must be addressed , but it is not a sector-specific problem
There is a misconception that has been stated repeatedly here , namely , that compliance with this law can be monitored at an international level
This law requires monitoring at a national level
Let me add that at a 4% rate , inspection would be more expensive than moving the European Parliament from Brussels to Strasbourg
I would like to ask my fellow Members to take this into consideration as well
If we reject this proposal , I would also like to say to my fellow Members that we are creating an advantage for third country hauliers
I would like to ask my fellow Members to bear in mind that this is the proposal which the Commission approved
To reject the proposal of the Commission , that is , of the European Commission , is to make it pointless , expensive and impossible to implement
The debate is closed
The vote will take place on Wednesday , 16 June 2010
Written statements (Rule 149)
must take action so that a new improved proposal is submitted by the Commission in future
and in the area of transport
to prove 'false' self-employment
unable to avoid unfair competition
competition in the European road transport market , we cannot adopt the Commission's proposal such as it stands today
The directive that we are debating today is the fruit of very lengthy negotiations in the European Parliament over two mandates
This is a very sensitive issue , as it concerns our jobs both today and in the future
It is a matter of road safety and of fair competition between companies in the Member States
I would not accept social dumping within our Union itself
Could an independent driver work 14 hours a day , 84 hours a week , and not be a risk on the roads
Compared with a company-employed driver , this is unfair competition
This also leads some companies to suggest to their employees that they declare themselves self-employed
We must protect our fellow citizens and our companies
within the scope of working time legislation
In certain EU countries , there is justified concern on the part of the trade union movement about phoney selfemployment in connection with the Working Time Directive and selfemployed drivers
Outsourcing and , as a consequence , employers evading their responsibilities , are growing problems
The way to solve the problem that has been suggested , that is , that selfemployed drivers should be included in the directive , however , is wrong
The right way to resolve the problems associated with phoney selfemployment would be to agree on a definition for selfemployment between worker and employer organisations at EU level
At present , the innocent have to suffer
With regard to this issue , we should proceed in accordance with the compromise which , among others , Mrs Wortmann-Kool , ViceChair of the centreright European People's Party (Christian Democrats) , was building
their own country
The suggestion would probably mean that Parliament and the Council would reach agreement on the directive at first reading
It is a pity that Parliament is not allowing any opportunities for a compromise
While we should be focusing more on improving the status of entrepreneurs , instead there is the possibility that the working hours of genuine entrepreneurs will be restricted
This is worrying , because the opportunities for small entrepreneurs to earn a living generally depend solely on the work they put in
The first item on the agenda is the report by Mrs Bauer , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the proposal for a directive of the
The Commission's proposal touches on three issues: the exemption of self-employed hauliers from the scope of the law , the provision of a more precise definition for night work and
First of all , experts have reached the unanimous conclusion that if the Commission's proposal is rejected , resulting in the directive's scope being extended to also include self-employed hauliers , it
Available statistical data and studies on accidents show that only 6% of accidents are caused by the fault of lorry drivers , and fatigue is cited as a reason in
Loading time is of a supplementary nature and cannot be regarded as a significant part of working time , as the law does not apply , for instance , to journeys under
Do not be confused by the term , because self-employed hauliers and small enterprises can also be unpleasant competitors on the market , just like self-employed hauliers arriving from new Member
I would like to move on to talk about a common labour market phenomenon that should not be dealt with , and indeed cannot be dealt with exclusively in the
Proposed Amendment 30 , tabled on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) , the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , the European Conservatives
and Reformists and the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group is based on the Commission's proposal and is supported by the Council , and I would like to thank the Council
The Commission has now carried out studies and made an impact assessment which clearly demonstrates that this directive is not the right tool to address transport policy issues such
I am very glad to see that the rapporteur shares the Commission's concern over the weak enforcement of the rules and the general problem of false self-employment , and I
Where Europe definitely needs action is in respect of so-called false self-employed drivers - that is , those drivers who are formally independent but , in practice , are employed by a single
Both the Commission proposal and the amendments proposed by the rapporteur give a clear message to industry: the phenomenon of false self-employment will not be tolerated and the legislator
At a time when we hope to begin to recover from the economic crisis , it would not be a good move to impose an additional administrative and financial burden on
I fail to understand how the Commissioner can speak of an agreement with Parliament when he has spoken with only one single member , a member who basically had no
Madam President , on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) , I would like to thank Mrs Bauer for her report and for her excellent work in
We need to tell those who cite shortcomings in road safety as justification for including self-employed workers that the rules on driving hours and rest times have long since been

We remain convinced that that needs to be the case , and I very much hope therefore that the proposal to reject the Commission's proposal will be agreed in the
Rather than reflecting and promoting the clear majority views of members of the European Parliament's Employment Committee , she has actively worked to promote the view of the Commission and
The other institutions , as Mme Ber√®s has said , have shown not one gram of loyal cooperation but instead have gone out of their way to subvert the very clear
It is quite possible under the existing regime for a self-employed , a 'false' self-employed , driver , to drive between 86 and 95 hours per week; perhaps not every week , but
It is crucial to remember that all drivers , employed or self-employed , come under the 2006 driving time regulations which regulate their driving time , their break times and their rest
Legislation must be based on sound reliable data and all the scaremongering about self-employed drivers working 86 hours per week and causing accidents is just that: it is scaremongering
Are we to have an army of inspectors looking over the shoulders of self-employed workers to see if they are performing general administrative duties or administration relating to the
Will the office located in the small bedroom or the attic of the self-employed driver's home be defined as his work station , and who will police and enforce the
It is disproportionate and will not achieve its aims , and it will pile further red tape and bureaucracy on already struggling SMEs in most countries and particularly in my
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the matter we are discussing today relates to an absolutely fundamental question: do we in the European Parliament want to ensure that we have a
I would like to finish by saying that this is not about Mrs Bauer's negotiation methods; it is about people and it is about whether we want to ensure decent
The Commission now wants it to cease to apply to so-called self-employed drivers , which would aggravate everyone's working conditions , particularly due to the possibility that working hours will be
Being receptive to arguments and studies that demonstrate the dangers of approving such a proposal , the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has already rejected it twice , but unfortunately , the
rapporteur , with the support of the Commission and the Council , has insisted on pursuing negotiations on the directive alone , as though the decision by the Committee on Employment and Social
We therefore call for the rejection of the Commission's proposal and compliance with the 2002 directive which , since 2009 , should be being applied to self-employed drivers in order to combat
They are misleading because safety is already guaranteed under the 2006 regulation , and detrimental because the competitiveness of thousands of small independent businesses , which have already been sorely tested
Ladies and gentlemen , let us not pretend to be unaware of the fact that the legal and technical disputes regarding the directive actually conceal yet another power struggle between European
It is all too easy to praise widespread entrepreneurship when the aim is to come up with effective strategies to combat the crisis , and then to sacrifice these when
(FR) Madam President , I am in favour of including self-employed drivers in the proposal for a directive , and I therefore reject both this proposal by the Commission and the Bauer
What is more , in 2002 , two Member States of the European Union appealed to the European Court of Justice to repeal Directive 2002/15/EC because it included self-employed drivers; the
(ES) Madam President , Commissioner , Mrs Bauer , I am obliged first of all to talk about my profound disappointment with you for the way that you have carried out a negotiation
We are not talking about anything other than the safety of self-employed drivers and members of the European public who travel on the roads; that is what we are
That is the big problem that we face here - and if what we have here is a private compromise between a Member of Parliament and the Council which
This area of work is already heavily regulated via the driving time regulations and to listen to people saying that people are driven into self-employed work is utterly ludicrous;
If included in these provisions , those tasks will be part of their working week so they will have less time to drive , load , unload and cater for passengers , as
The bigger operator will take up the slack and we will have another example of the EU promoting big business at the expense of the SMEs who employ half
(ES) Madam President , we believe it to be essential to include the self-employed in this directive , and this view is shared by the representatives of both unions and employers' associations
Firstly , because of workers' safety: self-employed hauliers deserve the same protection as other hauliers , not just when they are driving , but also when they are undertaking other tasks that
Clearly , everybody agrees that we should support SMEs and , by rights , everybody ought to be concerned about issues regarding , at one and the same time , safety , workers , road users
However , after Parliament rejected this text in spring 2009 , that summer , your predecessor , Commissioner Tajani , then canvassing his government for his re-appointment as Commissioner , told us that he would have
At a time when we are seeing a balance being restored between the institutions thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon , this Parliament is turning its back on using its collective
A second point relates to something I consider very problematic in the proposals by those who advocate including self-employed workers in the scope: how on earth are you going to
The matter of road safety is addressed by restricting driving times and having compulsory rest periods , for which there is the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council
A much better option to prevent accidents through tiredness would be more effective monitoring of the driving times and rest periods in force rather than artificially restricting the working
As the previous speaker rightly said , in the Nordic countries , like my country , Finland , the transport sector is dominated by small business entrepreneurs and mainly consists of firms with just
A more pragmatic approach should have been possible , namely including self-employed workers within the scope but , at the same time , taking account of the specific nature of self-employed drivers
I proposed , for example , that the digital tachograph measure not only driving times and rest periods but also loading and unloading operations , supplemented by a kind of unmonitored fixed
(IT) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission proposal and the position adopted by the rapporteur leave the Member States free to choose whether or not to include self-employed workers
By giving Member States freedom of choice , self-employed drivers in some countries that have already transposed the previous Directive 2002/15/EC would find themselves exposed to direct competition from those
Self-employed workers could go to a country with different legislation in force and be subject to fewer checks , which would cause a serious dumping problem and hence , a serious distortion
It goes without saying that low costs often equal a reduction in quality and , above all , in safety , which , in the transport sector , results in a serious increase in
In the light of this , I believe that the proposal is unacceptable and that it contravenes one of its legal bases , namely Article 153 of the treaty , since it neither
(MT) I think this Parliament would agree that European drivers should be provided with the best conditions , that we should ensure our roads are safe , and that we should do
If there is abuse among the self-employed , we should target the abuse , rather than those honest individuals among the self-employed who are trying their best to continue to improve
I believe we should exercise great care when it comes to introducing bureaucracy , because too much of it can cause harm and break this sector , especially at a time like
(DE) Madam President , Commissioner , the directive represents an important step in improving the health and safety of workers in this sector , but also in improving road safety and ensuring fair

We must not forget that we are dealing with the European Court of Justice in this matter , which has made it quite clear that priority must be given to
If self-employed workers were to be excluded from this directive again , then , in addition to their 56 hours of driving time , they would also be able to spend 28
(DE) Madam President , just as I have done for many years , I am today working for road safety , for an improvement in working conditions for professional drivers , and for an
It is obvious that what we are debating today is not the provisions on driving hours and rest times , which impact on road safety and are applicable to all professional
It is primarily a regulation for the protection of employees - in other words , it is solely for the social protection of drivers and in no way serves road
Restricting the permissible working hours of self-employed professional drivers in this way - and perhaps , in future , also those of self-employed tradesmen , architects or Members of Parliament - would send
(DE) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to appeal once more to the conservatives and liberals that we cannot here place the interests of the self-employed above the
Entrepreneurial freedom is undoubtedly a very good thing , but the safety of our children and of everyone on the roads is more important - and that , to my mind , is
More and more regular employment relationships are being ousted by ostensible self-employment , which is why we urgently need the situation to be analysed and a proposal to be made
How , for example , can economic activity be stimulated , if this place - the European Parliament - is going to be a place where we bring in new legislation which
Madam President , in a time of economic challenge , this Parliament has made much of its credentials in encouraging entrepreneurship and competitiveness but , at the same time , we are setting about
(DE) Madam President , Commissioner , the rapporteur , Mrs Bauer , demonstrates a failure to understand democracy in that she continued to negotiate - with no mandate - against the decision of the
(DE) Madam President , I believe that Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises are particularly important at this time , because the truth is that we will only find a way out of
I would ask those Members who advocate that the directive should apply to all to apply it to themselves and to have a tachograph installed in their own cars
There is a great temptation to go into detail and to have a debate on the details of this discussion , but I would like only to say that I
We do not have the studies mentioned here that self-employed drivers are regularly working 90 hours per week , and we think that the Driving Time Regulation , which we would
We do not have the information that they are more sick , and why do we sometimes think that small and medium-sized enterprises are behaving irresponsibly , that they do not
The Commission cannot support legislation which limits the freedom of entrepreneurs in the road transport sector to organise their working time , while in other sectors , entrepreneurs are not subject to
However , if the vote in this House confirms the rejection of the Commission proposal , then the Commission will review all possible options , including withdrawal of the proposal , and if
I have studied the Rules of Procedure carefully , and as far as I know , MEPs have full discretion to carry out their mandate and therefore they can consult whoever
I do not question , either , the grounds on which the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament submitted its proposed amendment , nor who
I agree that the issue of false self-employed entrepreneurs is a real European problem , and we incorporated it in the proposal , in cooperation with the fellow Members who considered
I approve of the position adopted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the rejection of the Commission's proposal and agree that in conjunction with Parliament , the Commission
I would like to stress that the Commission's proposal to remove self-employed drivers from the scope of the directive would represent a significant step backwards in EU social policy
I would like to draw attention to the fact that 'false' self-employed drivers weaken the overall labour market , and the main problem is that in practice , it is difficult
If we fail to take concrete action and legal measures , then false self-employed work by drivers will become one of the labour market's greatest problems and we will be
In order to improve the working conditions of all drivers and ensure their social rights and guarantees and in order to improve road safety , as well as avoid unfair
I therefore invite the European Commission to withdraw its proposal and , failing that , I call on MEPs , during tomorrow's vote in plenary , to vote in favour of keeping self-employed workers
Under this , freelance drivers remain outside the scope of the directive , but Member States may , if they wish , apply the regulation of full-time working hours to freelance drivers in

Establishment of residue limits of pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin (debate)
- (Rapporteur: Avril Doyle)
rapporteur
- Mr President , could I start by thanking all my shadow rapporteurs , and indeed the French Presidency for facilitating an early second-reading agreement
consumers of food of animal origin to residues of pharmacologically active substances present in veterinary medicines and biocidal products
of which a safety profile cannot be scientifically established
MRLs alone do not protect consumers
Consumers are directly protected by setting an appropriate withdrawal period before slaughter and by having controls in place to monitor it
In practice the withdrawal periods are set using a high safety factor which will reflect the amount of data available at the current stage of product development
We have reached an agreement on the key issues
setting MRLs for food imported from third countries
data
authorisation and their dossiers
The establishing of an MRL for a pharmacologically active substance requires an expensive data package of toxicology and metabolism studies
This is too costly for certain less common food species , so-called 'minor species' , as the market for veterinary medicines for these is small - so-called 'minor uses'
food-producing species containing a pharmacologically active substance
So this Minor Use/Minor Species (MUMS) issue is a problem urgently in need of resolution as it creates potential animal welfare and food safety issues
Vets have a duty of care and will always try to treat a sick animal
Under present legislation they are often forced to resort to unlicensed medicines
The lack of an MRL also prevents authorities from being able to establish a proper withdrawal period for a medicine
The current MRL Regulation does not require MRLs to be set for individual species
The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products (CVMP) sets MRLs for individual species , following an initial cautious approach
species as the MRLs for a particular substance are nearly always similar or identical
That same year , the CVMP issued a guideline on the establishment of MRLs for minor species
It defined minor food-producing species as all species except cattle , pigs and poultry , and they included salmonidae
It allowed the extrapolation from a major species to a minor species of the same family , ruminant to ruminant , fish to fish , chicken to other poultry
In 2008 , after eight years' experience , the CVMP issued a new guideline
The Risk Analysis approach for residues of veterinary medicinal products in food of animal origin
This describes a risk-based approach of extrapolation of an MRL for a substance from one or more species to additional species
identical
The text of this review before us simply provides a legal basis for the current practice of extrapolation in the interests of veterinary medicines availability and animal welfare

In clearly defined circumstances , certain products used for equidae will not have to have MRLs but will have to respect a six-month withdrawal period
this issue some months ago concerning a review of the Veterinary Medicines Directive
Vice-President of the Commission
European Commission
Its aim is to protect consumers against residues of medicinal products in foodstuffs whilst also improving the availability of veterinary medicinal products in the Community
It is also an important component of the Commission's legislative simplification programme
On 21 October of last year , the Council and Parliament concluded an agreement that is reflected in the present common position
Therefore , we now have a common position of not only the Council and Parliament but also the Commission
of the original Commission proposal
Thus , the Commission expressed its full support for the common position in its communication to the European Parliament of 8 January of this year
The adoption of the common position will now make it possible to bring this dossier to a successful conclusion before the end of this parliamentary term
in the interests of animal health and consumer protection in the Community

I am very much aware of the particular importance of the availability of veterinary medicinal products

to establish MRLs and the withdrawal period in the first place
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his cooperation in this area and put on the record the urgent need for review of the Veterinary Medicines Directive
are all very aware of
two decades
During this period , considerable efforts have been made by various stakeholders , including regulators , industry and veterinarians , to address the problems of the availability of medicines
Despite these efforts , the situation has continued to deteriorate
The lack of authorised medicines poses a real threat to animal health and welfare and the safety of consumers
of zoonotic disease implications from untreated or inappropriately treated animals for the animal owners , consumers and citizens
There are also financial , legal and trade implications for the various stakeholders involved , whilst the lack of medicines may have negative effects on rural economies and agriculture generally
An example - and a most important point - is the effect on pollination as a consequence of reduced numbers of bee colonies
Bees are a very important Minor Use/Minor Species (MUMS) issue

Thank you again to all colleagues and the Commissioner for cooperation on this report

The vote will take place tomorrow
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing
(HU) We often hear the complaint that the EU tries to regulate everything while at the same time failing to address important questions
Many of us may think that this report is also of this nature
This would be a mistake , however
citizens
The existing regulations are out of date , and make it problematic for veterinarians to restock their store of medicines
For this reason , appropriate regulation for the distinctive features of this branch is needed
Nowadays more and more pharmaceutical companies have a division dealing with animal products , which generate considerable revenue
The demand is growing steadily , as animals also fall ill , and now , when food is increasingly valuable , it is worth preventing this
Yet in recent times , several pieces of information have come to our attention to the effect that certain companies are working on how to 'obtain' more from animals
Rapidly growing chickens , pigs that are fattened to enormous size in a matter of months
All this in done with (medicinal) products which are often harmful to human beings
or not residues of such products that remain in the animals and are later consumed by human beings present any danger
The testing is paid for by the company
rapid access to the medicinal products
Nothing is more important that human health , and therefore we need to erect a barrier to'animal doping' motivated by monetary gain
The next item is the recommendation for second reading by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of
the European Parliament and of the Council laying down Community procedures for the establishment of residue limits of pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin , repealing Council Regulation (EEC)
No 2377/90 and amending Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15079/2/2008 - C6-0005/0009
This is a rather technical proposal as it aims to update the existing EU regime , the main purpose of which is to protect public health by limiting the exposure of
This is achieved by setting safety thresholds or maximum residue levels (MRLs) for approved substances and by banning substances which are either found to be unsafe or in respect
First of all , extrapolation of MRLs set for one species to another; secondly , adopting within the EU MRLs set internationally within the Codex Alimentarius; and , thirdly , creating a framework
We managed to clarify the measures which need to be taken when unauthorised substances are found either in EU-produced food or in food imported from third countries , as well as
clarifying the basis for reviewing these reference points for action (RPAs): that is , the maximum level established for control purposes for any unauthorised substance in the light of any new
The question of setting MRLs for certain biocidal products such as disinfectants used in the animal environment was also agreed on , particularly in regard to the financing aspects of their
Setting an MRL is the first step that must be accomplished before an application can be submitted to the regulatory authorities for authorisation of a veterinary medicine for a
In 1997 and following five years' experience , the CVMP reviewed all the MRLs that had been set and concluded that it was not necessary to set MRLs for individual
This guideline allows the extrapolation of MRLs from data on the three major species to all species , provided the MRLs set for the three major species are similar or
Two amendments specifically target the lack of availability of species-specific medicines for equidae (I must declare an interest) across a range of therapeutic and welfare needs , including the concept of
'clinical benefit' and not just the requirement that it is 'essential' to have a medicinal product added to the positive list of substance for equidae referred to in the Veterinary
Perhaps there is a declaration - may I ask through the Chair - that the Commissioner is going to put on the record: I recall a discussion in relation to
- (DE) Mr President , honourable Members , the revision of the legislation on residue limits of pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin is an important initiative for the
I am delighted that the Commission was able to incorporate the amendments from both the European Parliament and the Council , as they retain both the spirit and the substance
Concluding it on the basis of the present common position will enable those involved with food controls and veterinary medicinal products on a daily basis to do a better job
These people have been waiting for the revision of the legislation on residue limits very impatiently for a very long time , and I think they really have waited long
Therefore , irrespective of the progress that the present Regulation on residue limits of pharmacologically active substances already represents in this regard , the Commission will present an assessment of the
I should like to take this opportunity to express my special thanks to the rapporteur , Mrs Doyle , whose truly tireless efforts have enabled us to reach agreement on this important
The Commission is aware of concerns expressed by citizens , veterinarians , Member States and the animal health industry as regards the directive laying down the rules for the authorisation of veterinary
medicinal products , in particular the importance of addressing existing problems linked to the availability of veterinary medicines and the use of medicinal products in species for which they are not
The Commission points out that positive steps are being taken in this direction such as the simplification of the rules on variations of veterinary medicinal products and this review
In addition , in order to address the objectives of consumer safety and animal health protection , competitiveness of the veterinary industry including SMEs and reduction of administrative burden , the Commission will
- Mr President , I would like just to put on the record that there is one amendment which I cannot support as it would , in fact , create a legal
If you cannot administer a drug under test to animals unless it already has an MRL , then you cannot carry out tests that are necessary to obtain the data
In a sense we are using this MRL review as a bit of a 'patch and mend' for a major problem that is under the radar but which we
The availability of an adequate range of veterinary medicines to treat the wide variety of animal species in the European Community has been a growing challenge over the last
It also raises significant problems for animal owners , farmers , veterinarians and governments if animals are untreated , or treated with an unauthorised or an unsuitable product - including the risk
However , not only does the current availability problem in the EU have implications across the board for the health and welfare of animals , the security of the Community's food supply
and public health , it also undermines the ability of the EU to meet the Lisbon Agenda and to reap the enormous potential for European agriculture and offshore aquaculture to attract
For in this case , we are talking about 'foodstuffs' consumed by human beings - this is what we would like to render more secure in the interests of our
This is why every single preparation that is given to animals must be tested , in collaboration with the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) , to determine whether
We also need to emphasise the possibility of a fast-track procedure , which reduces the time needed for administration , and it is also important that veterinarians thus have much more

Scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union (debate)
The next item is the statement by the Commission on the Scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union
Member of the Commission
scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons
First , I would like to emphasise the importance of this programme for the most deprived citizens of Europe
I can mention two figures here
Each year more than 18 million people receive more than 440 000 tonnes of food distributed under this programme
Over the years this programme has become one of the main sources of supply to charities working in the field of food aid
More than half the products distributed by the members of the European Federation of Food Banks in 2010 originated from this programme
So it is really important
Last April the general Court set aside the provisions of the 2009 plan for products purchased in the market
Specifically , the Court ruled that the Commission cannot define the volume of the programme independently of the volume of existing stocks
The total volume of the plan must also be adapted to the volume of the existing stocks when the plan is drawn up
The proportion of products purchased in the market in relation to the total volume of the plan must reflect their exceptional nature
Following the Court's judgment and given the limited volume of intervention stocks available , the 2012 plan had to be greatly reduced
not be provided at European level
As regards the future , the Commission made various initial proposals in 2008 , followed by an amended proposal in September 2010
The express aim of these proposals was to make the scheme sustainable as intervention stocks become increasingly scarce
Siekierksi
The Commission has always appreciated the clear stance of Parliament on this matter
However , a sufficient majority has not yet been obtained in the Council
But the Commission is firmly committed to the continuation of the scheme in the future and is ready to make any adjustments
Against this background , in its recently released communication for a multiannual budget for the period 2014-2020 , the Commission has proposed a budget of EUR 2
8 billion at current prices
social policies
The necessary legal proposals will come in due course
In the meantime , the Commission recalls that an agreement on the basis of its 2010 proposal is needed with a view to securing a food distribution plan in 2013
I am confident that this package will help an agreement between the Council and Parliament to be reached , so as to ensure legal certainty and stable financing for the scheme
For this compromise we need strong support from this body
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am outraged by the recent Court of Justice rulings on the food distribution scheme for our most deprived citizens
The European Parliament has shown just how much we have all been united and scandalised by this ruling , which is a purely legal decision
The fact is that 2010 was the European Year for Combating Poverty
Now , in 2011 , we are questioning the future of the food distribution scheme for our most deprived citizens for the next two years: 2012 and 2013
This aid benefits Europeans
Many of our fellow citizens in the 27 Member States need this aid to survive
The decision was also taken during a crisis
Taking the two factors together , it is clear that we are heading for massive problems that will hit our most deprived citizens the hardest
As the rapporteur on the European Social Fund (ESF) for the 27 Member States , Parliament has naturally fought to provide aid for the least well-off through social policies
who have no jobs , to return to the labour market
That is the purpose of the ESF
our most deprived citizens
Consequently Parliament will work tirelessly to ensure that the ESF and that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) , which also helps workers in difficulties , are maintained
However , we will also continue to work on combating poverty and devising workable food aid schemes
I am therefore calling on the Council to accept its responsibilities and support these social policies
a harsh winter , the winter of 1986-87
Will the coming winter , in the midst of a prolonged crisis , be any less harsh
I suspect not
Why , then , should we abandon this programme
Why should we take an axe to it , as the Commission has just done in the 2012 budget that it has presented
We are going over the same ground as when we negotiated on the Europe 2020 strategy
We were told that combating poverty was the responsibility of Member States - an issue covered by subsidiarity and therefore outside the European Union's competences
Ultimately , we decided otherwise
Once again , we are being told that this policy area can only be dealt with at Member State level
That is not on
Solidarity has to be a European principle , otherwise the essence of solidarity will be lost
This programme is also now a victim of the success of the agricultural policy , which has reduced stocks and banned the creation of any new stocks
Surely this should raise some questions
Union policies: in the policies themselves , the resources deployed and action taken
What happened to that overarching European Union approach
Commissioner , we are calling on you to reinstate the budgetary resources for the food distribution scheme for our most deprived citizens
We are calling on you to give a clear undertaking that the financial perspective will not cut off a single cent from this service for our most deprived citizens
on behalf of the ALDE Group
of fire
The amount of aid is going to be cut by 80% in 2012 and there are no guarantees at all for 2013
Therefore , you urgently need to come up with a practical solution for the millions of beneficiaries
to our most deprived citizens
budget of around EUR 500 million - although that figure will have to allow for changes in food prices
To do that , you will need to mobilise the requisite budgetary resources
That is what we in this House expect from you
In the long term , we need to agree to restrict speculation on commodities so as to create more control over food prices
Obviously , European farmers of the future will need to be able to make a living from what they produce
Consumers should no longer have to live with constant price rises , and our most deprived citizens must have enough to eat
European solidarity is needed more than ever before
It is therefore our duty and your duty to make this aid permanent , given that millions of individuals depend on it
It is incumbent upon us and upon you to combat poverty and exclusion in Europe
on behalf of the ECR Group
- Madam President , can I first of all say this has been , and probably will continue to be , an extremely important scheme
cannot change it for the future
I think the CAP has a responsibility to produce the food
That does not necessarily mean they are the right people to distribute that aid
I think that is the question that has to be answered here
We live in a time when everybody talks about the same thing: food security , food security , food security
When I came to this Parliament we had beef mountains , butter mountains , milk lakes - this is all gone
There is no food security anymore
Now we have the challenge of ensuring that we are able to feed the world , able to feed the people of Europe
I think that is the challenge that is before us
That is what the CAP has got to do
Food waste is a terrible thing , and I think we can do an awful lot to bring it under control
Madam President , 13 million impoverished people depend on the European food programme
The European Union itself has created this dependence , and that includes Germany and all those other Member States that now suddenly want to put an end to this programme
It is inhumane to now allow those 13 million people to go hungry
An urgent solution needs to be found to this urgent problem
In the longer term , we hope that food aid will no longer be necessary in Europe
It is clearly a scandal that more than 40 million people have too little to eat on a continent that is as rich as ours
I expect the Commission and the Member States to do everything in their power to ensure that poverty has been cut by 25% by 2020 , as we have promised
Even then , it will be another 40 years before poverty is completely banished from Europe , and people will need food aid for all that time
Over the last two years I have visited food banks throughout Europe , from France to Serbia and from Iceland to Slovakia
Some food banks are completely independent of the European programme , others absolutely not , but all of them could use some help
help is with money and with expertise in relation to logistics , transport and storage
For the new budget period , we need to look into how we can best use European resources in order to help as many people in poverty as possible
Until then , there needs to be a proper transitional period during which we all take responsibility for the 13 million ultra-vulnerable Europeans who rely on us
social crisis in several EU Member States
its own goals of combating poverty and social exclusion
It is scandalous that food aid is being reduced by 80% , since 13 million people here in the European Union currently benefit from it
necessary for an active , healthy life
Because of this , we advocate the continuation of this support , bearing in mind that more than 80 million people in the European Union are at risk of poverty
income in each country
need , based on the EUR 500 million , and also that they subsequently present a proposal and a timetable for the implementation of the minimum income scheme
(PL) Madam President , in the European Union we talk a great deal about freedom , democracy and human rights
We boast of our achievements and of spreading these values
Yet what is poverty , and what causes it
In the vast majority of cases , poverty is caused by a lack of work or other reasons that those hit by poverty cannot do anything about
How can we accept that 40 million people in Europe live in poverty , and that a further 40 million are living on the poverty line
Does such a situation not mean that human rights and freedoms are being restricted
Is this what democracy means
We are currently experiencing a crisis , unemployment rates are rising , and what is the Commission doing
It is placing restrictions on funding for the distribution of free food to poor people
We should maintain the current funding of EUR 500 million per year earmarked for this purpose
legal basis for the programme
It should be noted that this ruling merely annulled Article 2 of the Regulation , which relates to additional purchases of food on the market
The Regulation thus remains in force , and can provide a legal basis for the programme
In my opinion , we should not create a new programme; we must merely modify the existing programme , in order to increase the amount of food at its disposal
At the same time , in recent years the European Union has been spending enormous amounts on limiting production
How is this possible , what purpose does it serve
(FR) Madam President , the Commission's decision to cut the funding for this food distribution programme so drastically does need to be challenged
Why did the Commission not appeal against the Court of Justice ruling
Why did it not immediately propose an alternative
How is it that a legal basis can be found for EUR 113 million in funding , but not for EUR 500 million
Unfortunately , this programme is needed , because not all Europeans have enough to eat
As you reminded us , the scheme benefits 18 million people
The Europe 2020 strategy aims to move 20 million people out of poverty
Food poverty is one factor
to this decision was to call for both short-term and medium-term initiatives to ensure that our most deprived citizens are not forgotten
We urgently need to come up with some solutions that address both social and agricultural issues linked to the problem
This must not be done at the expense of the budget for other social policies
be put to the vote at midday
(FR) Madam President , Commissioner , I think that we could contemplate changes to the budget line
We are not asking for conservatism , but we are asking for two things from the Commission
The first is a recognition that the growing inequalities in Europe are probably the greatest threat to European integration since the Union was created
apparently paid seven-figure bonuses
That is both a reality and how people perceive reality: this is what they hear every evening on the television
You can run as many information campaigns as you like , but if we fail to halt these growing inequalities , this project could go very wrong
Secondly , I would like the Commission to be consistent
The fact that combating poverty and exclusion is one of the five key Europe 2020 strategy targets is a real achievement
Put simply , then , we are asking for a little consistency with regard to that target
You need to know that this House will back you if any Member States object
Member States are the happiest places on earth , and that many people from outside Europe are attempting to gain entry to them
cannot afford to buy food
the price of food is rising and more and more people will not be able to afford to buy it
The food aid which has been provided by the EU to date is therefore particularly important , and one of the best of our joint endeavours
This aid should continue to be provided
EUR 500 million per annum is the equivalent of an annual contribution for such aid of one euro per EU citizen
Legal problems should be no obstacle
current level , since there really are a great many people who need and expect this aid
(FR) Madam President , this is a genuine scandal , a denial of justice
Member States have disputed the mechanism , because in Europe , unfortunately , we are only able to make savings at the expense of the weak
So we are now heading straight for a food crisis for over 20 million Europeans
From a figure of EUR 500 million in 2011 , the food distribution scheme will be cut to EUR 113 million in 2012
shocking message to the victims of the crisis
Those who are hungry do not care about stupid quarrels
Parliament has a duty to restore Europe's political honour by somehow reversing this scandalous decision
(ES) Madam President , the reality: 30 million people are malnourished and 79 million people live in poverty; the tragedy: a court decision; the shame: that we allow this
The European Parliament must make its unanimous and powerful voice heard
This is an opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to the weakest people
We must make a distinction between selfish rhetoric and real solidarity
We , Madam President , must create the momentum so that the Council allows us to do away with the blocking minority
We are wholeheartedly calling for the solidarity - agreed to yesterday in this House - of the President-in-Office of the Council , of the Polish Presidency
Ladies and gentlemen , Parliament cannot forsake millions of people , the poorest of the poor , who suffer the most acute effects of the crisis
We are talking about a budget going from EUR 500 million to EUR 113 million , which is a decrease of 63%
present here , in this House , the house of the people and of the European peoples
deprived persons in the Union
This ruling reduces the money to be used for purchasing the food to be distributed next year by social organisations from EUR 500 million to just EUR 113 million
Solidarity with the most needy people and combating social exclusion are the foundations of the Union and the Europe 2020 strategy
Therefore , at a time of economic crisis like now and taking into account our own commitments , this scheme becomes even more essential
end to European aid
scheme with one that enables us to continue to meet the needs of these people

I call on you to urgently look for a temporary solution while working on a permanent one , meaning a new scheme that can continue to help those most in need
(FR) Madam President , Commissioner , we have all gathered this morning to express our anger
There may be legal reasons for the decision that has been taken , but it makes no political sense
goes to our most deprived citizens
You cannot leave it there
You cannot
All the political groups in Parliament are calling on you to make the right decisions
We are not talking about EUR 500 million as opposed to EUR 100 million
We are talking about at least maintaining existing levels of food aid
Demand is growing in every country
Let me say a few words on the subject of agriculture
Once again , my comments are directed at the Commission
The question of agricultural stocks is not the same as it was 10 , 15 or 20 years ago , when intervention stocks left us with huge surpluses
In the current European situation , we need a policy on food security stocks , both for Europe and for the rest of the world
I say this in the light of starvation levels around the world and the current situation in Europe
These are two very clear signals
You must reinstate a decent budget that will allow us to address this problem
In terms of agricultural policy , the Commission now needs to put forward clear proposals that will allow the creation of what we are calling food security stocks
The reality is that access to food is a major problem at the dawn of the 21st century , both in Europe and in the rest of the world
This morning , this House is sending you a very clear message
I hope that you are up to this massive challenge
not as real people
These people are often women and children or the elderly - the most vulnerable population groups in other words

period
The UN report on the food crisis compels us to take immediate , responsible action
(EL) Madam President , Commissioner , poverty is a political , economic and social problem that needs far more than superficial relief for human suffering
That is why we consider that there are two particularly important points in the problem at issue
this needs to be addressed in a viable and cohesive manner
Secondly , a bureaucratic monetary approach cannot overcome the essence , both political and humanistic , of such an issue , especially in the current environment
appear that each and every inhabitant of EU27 can still throw away 179 kilograms of food , which of course may be edible for those who can barely scrape by
markets
The Court's decision takes the view that volumes of products distributed under the Food Aid Programme must be adapted to volumes of intervention stocks
In many countries , EU food aid is distributed via communities and aid agencies , which is to say , on a voluntary basis
The dramatic reduction in the product range under the Food Aid Programme may endanger the entire food distribution scheme
The voluntary networks will break up , and food aid donated from elsewhere , shops , for example , might not be distributed
European Year of Volunteering
Are these European Years just for speeches in honour of special occasions
What does the Commission intend to do to put this right
endorsed swingeing cuts to the budget for our most deprived citizens amounting to nearly EUR 400 million
resolution that has just been tabled by Parliament
In the debate on the multiannual financial framework , Mr Barroso reminded us just how much the most deprived European citizens need our help in order to survive
a position on the draft regulation that was first tabled in 2008 and , as a matter of urgency , to continue the scheme in 2012
keeping this dossier on the back burner for three years
The ball is now clearly in the Council's court: the Council needs to find a solution for 2012
(FI) Madam President , poverty , regrettably , is a problem in Europe
In Finland too , there are food queues , and those you are most likely to find queuing are unemployed women over 50 with families
The EU has created safety nets for the financial markets , but it has not done the same for the poor and vulnerable
It is disgraceful that there are still food queues in Europe and that we have to distribute food
I would hope that the Commission will devise and draw up a sustainable programme to eradicate poverty like this , so that people do not have to queue for food
As long as there is no such programme , however , I think that we will need to continue with this scheme
(ES) Madam President , I have received in recent days , as I am sure many of you have , several messages of distress from many banks
However , these are not the sort of banks which speculate and invest in wars
Rather , they are banks that help people to survive
investment activities , and yet we were unable to assist banks that are specifically designed to help the 13 million people living on a day-to-day basis

We need a new legal basis , and Parliament is determined to obtain it

Even so , experience shows that the scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union still has a relevant role to play
Unfortunately , the fact of the matter is that nearly 13 million people in the Union rely on this scheme
This hardly shows our work in a good light

It therefore follows that we need to come up with an alternative funding programme as a transitional solution for the 2012-2013 financial period
(IT) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , if there is one thing that we could do to make people hate Europe , then I have to say it is this
Obviously we risk contradicting ourselves even though we are acting on the orders of a Court
I have to say , however , that we must not just remedy and hence refinance this budget chapter; we must also have the foresight to understand how to proceed
The agricultural sector is a wholly European sector , from the financing of the budget right up to distribution
The social sector is not
In many countries people struggle to understand what the Ministry of Social Affairs is and what powers it has
To organise a dialogue on food banks with the social sector at the level of national ministries will be complicated and costly
Therefore , instead of throwing money at it straight away , we should also try to identify the most suitable instrument , or else we will cause further difficulties for everyone
(PL) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , a very difficult decision awaits us
Firstly , we have established an excellent aid chain
It starts with the European Commission transferring money , and then non-governmental organisations supply basic products to the most deprived persons
These basic products include porridge , rice , flour , and sometimes tinned foods , milk and butter
I do not understand how we can now deprive many people in difficult situations of this basic assistance
I have met these people on many occasions , and they were enormously grateful
the Commission today to retract this ill-advised and harmful decision
There is still time to do so
We spend many billions on the common agricultural policy
It is not worth depriving ourselves of such an excellent programme
themselves
the right to food
and long term , which will be appropriate to the legal situation
The common agricultural policy is a social policy where not only farmers must be represented , but also all European citizens as taxpayers
This is why support for people in need is a responsibility which must demonstrate unity in diversity at EU level
Member of the Commission
- Madam President , I very much appreciate this lively discussion
The message of all the speakers to the Commission is very clear
The Commission has to keep it in mind and I hope also the other institutions will do the same
All European institutions will have to make joint efforts
values; it also has to do with implementation and results
So after 2010 , the Year of Poverty , we have to face the situation , and we cannot be happy about the results on our continent
We have to fight poverty in a real and very inclusive way
So let me be clear about the future , the Commission now has to assess the situation following the decision of the Court
We have to assess the situation , not in a legalistic way , and we have to respect the European institutions
Let me remind you of the decision of the Court: the Court ruled that the volume covered by the plan had to be adapted to the volume of existing stocks
I would also like mention that the wording of the judgment and its grounds left very little room for any change to this position
That is why the Commission did not appeal
This is the reason
So what can we do now
We have two problems to face: how to find a permanent solution and an interim solution , as you have very clearly pointed out
What I can say on the interim solution is that the Commission proposal for 2010 , if adopted , can provide the sum of up to EUR 500 million for 2013
We have to work on the basis of your proposals and we are trying to take on board your suggestions about the next two years
With regard to the long-term solution , we have decided to fund this programme through social funding
I can understand your concerns
We all have to work together in order to have this funding
But this should not be to the detriment of other purposes; this is also important
I would like to inform you that the Commission has proposed EUR 2
8 billion for the social programme for the years 2014 to 2020
We really need to implement our 2020 strategy , which includes the goal of poverty reduction
So this is the situation and we are going to do our best and keep in mind all of your suggestions
Let me close with a small reference to my portfolio , I am the Commissioner for Fisheries

We are going to stop discarding , and distribute the fish and the food that would have been discarded in these programmes

Solidarity between European citizens is one of the fundamental values that unite all of us here
We also have a duty to protect that solidarity
In 1986 , we chose to come to the aid of those in extreme poverty
Morally speaking , Europe today has no right to deprive our least well-off citizens of food aid because of legal concerns and some partners' lack of commitment
If this crisis is not resolved , it will have catastrophic repercussions for European charity work
We urgently need to bury our differences now and quickly come up with a solution that will take us up to 2014
We also need to consider the future of this programme in the next budgetary period

As I see it , this is the message that Parliament needs to send to the States and to the European people

(FR) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the attitude of the European Commission is deplorable in that it has not appealed against the Court of Justice ruling and has effectively
However , I was delighted to hear what Mr Barroso had to say when he addressed Parliament on Tuesday , which was along the same lines as the motion for a
He therefore called for the food distribution scheme for the most deprived to be renewed for the 2014-2020 period , but also promised to urge the Council to finally take
Let me , then , pick up on those proposals and ask the Council - although it will not be able to reply today - why it can give no justification for
It would be absurd - and indeed it already is - if the EU were able to save certain banks which do engage in these sorts of speculation and
As parliamentarians , we cannot allow this , and I hope that today's vote , as well as the Polish Presidency , will resolve the food scheme problem so that the debate we
It would be - I repeat - absurd to save the banks and financiers on the one hand , and to be prevented from resolving the basic aid problem on the
(IT) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that Parliament should send a strong message today to the Commission and the Council , a European message and a message drawing attention
I do not believe that this Parliament , which was democratically elected by the European people , should be seen to be insensitive to this problem , which is not really a problem
Today , therefore , I call on all my fellow Members from all the political groups to cast a united and consistent vote in favour of this motion so that we can
Not only are European men and women concerned by the unfair and , it seems , unnecessarily technocratic decision to cut this aid from EUR 500 million to EUR 100 million
They are also telling us that this is a political decision driven by a handful of heads of government within the European Union , notably the German Chancellor , Mrs Merkel ,
We are also asking you , Commissioner , to ensure that the European Commission monitors the balance of power and to make a commitment before Parliament to reinstate the EUR 500
(FR) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in 1986 , a great French actor , the founder of the Restos du coeur soup kitchens , said: 'It is high time that we showed some
How long are we going to wait before adopting a real framework directive on minimum pay that will allow everyone to live in dignity , but above all , will give
At a time when we are discussing a European platform against poverty and when we are being told that 43 million Europeans are at risk , you decide to cut
I want to talk about the inhabitants of the outermost regions of the European Union , who are despairing at the prospect of losing their only means of survival when
The Commission will then need to come up with the right procedures for making this food distribution scheme for our most deprived citizens both permanent and consistent with the
(SK) Madam President , we all strive and frankly wish for living conditions and living standards for our citizens that will not leave them dependent on humanitarian aid for people in
I agree with those fellow Members who say that the food distribution scheme should not become entrenched in EU policy and that we should instead be aiming to integrate
In the current situation , however , it would probably be imprudent to scale down the scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union without introducing an adequate
Not only on my own behalf , but also on behalf of the Federation of Polish Food Banks and the people who benefit from this aid , I am calling on
(RO) Madam President , although we have in Europe the highest standards of living in the world , there are millions of people who are unable to provide the necessary food for
Reducing the total funds available for the scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the European Union will deprive many people of a basic right -
The judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union must be backed up by finding solutions for continuing the scheme on a permanent basis in the medium
I share your concerns about these people , the most deprived people , and I can also accept what we have said: that a European idea is not only about principles and
In the framework of the reform for the fisheries policy - which I will propose to the Commission next week - we also will create a facility for fish
It is clear from the figures of the European Programme for the most Deprived People that the programme is extremely important for the 43 million people in the EU at
Given that one of the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy is the reduction of poverty in the EU , there must be strong support for this scheme , especially since the
European farmers produce high quality food , and in my opinion it is of significant advantage to the EU that the common agricultural policy (CAP) is able to make wholesome
While many people question this social role of the CAP and the EU , I believe that the EU has an obligation to develop all aspects of policies such as the
In the context of the period of crisis that we are currently going through , it is unacceptable that , due to a technical matter , it is not possible to continue to
Taking into account the judgment of the European Court of Justice , I appeal to the Commission and the Council to find a legal solution which allows the continuation of
This topical issue should also prompt us to ask more far-reaching questions about which model would be best for Europe in terms of guaranteeing security of agricultural production and
Request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity: see Minutes

I will say no more , but I am disgusted - we must all be disgusted - at this savagery
Please protest on behalf of all of us
(Loud applause)
Mrs Doyle , I read this report myself and I must tell you I was outraged and shocked
I believe your applause is a clear indication of the fact that we are all in agreement that I should announce the indignation of this House to Afghanistan
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed
Are there any comments
Madame President , I have a problem with yesterday' s Minutes
They refer to me as 'Mr'
it to read 'Madame'
Well , I am quite dismayed at all these errors , which are obviously technical errors
All the same , they are not acceptable , and we shall straighten all this out
Madam President , on page 20 of the Minutes , it is announced that I spoke in support of Mr Dupuis
Well , we are colleagues , and often agree , but that is not the point
Both Mr Dupuis' speech and my own were intended to challenge the request made by the chair , Mr Bar√≥n Crespo , regarding the application of Rule 112
was
Very well , Mr Dell' Alba
That is what I am here for
Madam President , yesterday's Minutes in the English also seem to indicate that they were the Minutes of Thursday 17 December
I am sure that Parliament would not be writing today's Minutes before we have actually had our debates and votes
I hope that will be corrected
No , of course , I can assure you immediately that that is not the case
It is indeed an error
Madam President , I want to refer to your expression of sympathy with the people of France who are affected by severe flooding
It was very appropriate that you should raise this matter yesterday morning
But you not only expressed sympathy , you also requested the Commission to provide some assistance
Sometimes in Parliament the right hand does not know what the left one is doing
A couple of years ago we took away the possibility of extending assistance to people in such instances in the European Union
We expressed the same sympathy with the Greeks and requested the same assistance , but there is no money available
We ought therefore in future to either provide the money and the conditions under which it is paid or cease to ask the Commission to give assistance
What we gave the Greeks was an empty cup
We are offering the same thing to the people of France
Thank you , Mr McCartin
Indeed , I had to mention the same problem when opening yesterday' s sitting
Madam President , I would like to table a procedural motion
I failed to notice that we had moved on from the procedural motions to the report
paper being wasted in this establishment
any kind of recycling scheme
At the other Parliament based in Brussels , we at least have cardboard boxes where we can deposit the massive amounts of paper which we no longer need
can play a key role in the recycling of paper
I would like to ask you to make a little effort here
Surely , the budget could stretch to a few cardboard boxes for the Members where we can stock paper for recycling purposes
Thank you , Mr Vander Taelen , for this contribution which is indeed not strictly relevant to the Minutes
But that does not matter
problem you have brought up
(The Minutes were adopted)
Decision on urgent procedure
Madam President , I was waiting for the vote on the Minutes to be completed before responding to Mr Vander Taelen
paper and card bin
So we do have this kind of sorting of waste in Parliament at Strasbourg
the internal investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)
President
Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party
The request for urgent procedure is motivated by the fact that it is imperative to respect the interinstitutional commitments on OLAF , implemented by the other institutions concerned
to which my Group and , I believe , the other groups have tried to dispel the legitimate doubts which some of our colleagues may have
It is now time to assume our responsibilities once Parliament has signed , ratified , supported and negotiated this agreement
I made my request on the basis of Rule 112(2) and in relation to Rule 60(1) , because it is not a legislative question
It is a constitutional question insofar as it is an interinstitutional agreement
Madam President , I would ask you to permit me a moment longer since I have not requested the floor for personal reasons
Yesterday I suffered aggression on the part of a Member , Mr Dupuis , who described the signatories of this request as "the accomplices of Mr Bar√≥n Crespo"
He then did me the honour of comparing me to one of his favourite heroes
He said that I was a Stalinist
political bullying
And I , who try to respect my colleagues , would like to receive the same treatment
Mr Dupuis did not quite go as far as describing us as a revisionist clique , in the best Stalinist tradition
That would have been the last straw
Thank you , Mr Bar√≥n Crespo
I think that Mr Dupuis will have the opportunity to respond to you , since he has signed up to speak against this request
Mr Bar√≥n Crespo has just presented the request
Mr Poettering is asking for the floor to speak in favour of this request
Madam President , I must comment here
for a vote to be taken on the Napolitano report
of your Office
with the situation
We said that we wished to conclude this tiresome business in November
And we keep to our word
But it is of course the responsibility of the President of the Parliament to ensure that the procedures run properly
We assume that the urgent procedure can be dealt with in accordance with the rules
On this basis we support the vote on Thursday , that is to say , today , so that we can bring this tiresome matter to a close
But we expect that everything is in order with regard to the formal procedure
Thank you , Mr Poettering
Yes , I believe that if the vote were to take place tomorrow , on Friday , we would have some trouble in mustering the 314 votes necessary
But you never know
Madam President , I think that Mr Voggenhuber wishes to speak against this proposal
I am myself speaking to say that this request in inadmissible , insofar as Rule 112 refers to Rule 60 , which is about Commission proposals and legislative texts
Mr Bar√≥n Crespo has a very flexible view of our Rules of Procedure
Yesterday he spoke of Rule 60 , today he is talking about Rule 61 , on constitutional matters
Those present may observe the rich nature of Strasbourg nights and their capacity to cause our internal regulations to increase in number
of the Parliament
This is , then , further evidence that the procedure that Mr Bar√≥n Crespo requested yesterday has nothing to do with Rule 112
I therefore request , Madam President , that there should be no vote and that Mr Bar√≥n Crespo' s request is considered inadmissible
Very well , thank you , Mr Dupuis
Mr Dupuis has just spoken regarding the admissibility of this request
Mr Dupuis , you will not be surprised to hear that I spent some time last night studying this matter
And I came to the conclusion that the request was perfectly admissible according to the Rules of Procedure
Well , we have heard your views
I now give the floor to Mr Voggenhuber , to speak against the request
Madam President , I am sorry to have to contradict you afterwards
I am of completely the opposite opinion
Rule 112 speaks quite clearly of a debate on a proposal on which the opinion of the Parliament is required
It is quite clear that we are dealing here with an amendment to the Rules of Procedure
It is not a matter of the interinstitutional agreement
That is not the subject of the Napolitano amendment
It is rather an amendment to the Rules of Procedure and it is quite clear that it does not formally come under Rule 112
It is therefore politically so important because the Rules of Procedure of this House should be protected from being amended ad hoc and according to individual situations
That is a safeguard of the Rules of Procedure , that it does not fall under Rule 112
It is the case in all national parliaments that Rules of Procedure cannot just be amended according to the mood of the moment
of Procedure
Proposals were declared inadmissible that were clearly admissible under the Rules of Procedure
It was omitted to set deadlines for proposals for amendment
The large groups have tried to bring about this proposal through the repeated deliberate disregard of the Rules of Procedure
that in this interinstitutional agreement there is associated damage to the rights of Parliament , serious damage to the independent mandate and a limitation of the constitutional role of this House
The EPP was quite justified in sending this report back to the Committee again
Rules of Procedure
for this House
house
(Applause)
I would ask you to note , Madam President , that this debate cannot now be concluded forcibly and by breaching the Rules of Procedure
(Applause)
Ladies and gentlemen , matters seem clear enough , as much as they can be
be treated as urgent
" And Rule 60(1) specifies , "Proposals from the Commission and other documents of a legislative nature"
The problem of interpretation is focused on the nature of Mr Napolitano' s report
of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to the inquiries carried out by OLAF
to by Rule 112 of the Rules of Procedure
I hope I have made this sufficiently clear
Mr Napolitano , could you tell me if you share my opinion
Madam President , I completely agree with the definition that you gave of the mandate given to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , a very specific and limited mandate
It is simply a question of inserting the interinstitutional agreement into our Rules of Procedure , and I therefore agree with what you said about the nature of the report
Agenda
Ladies and gentlemen , we are not going to spend all morning on this
We have heard Mr Bar√≥n Crespo presenting the request , and Mr Poettering speaking in favour of this request
Now I would like to know if there is any Member who wishes to speak against this request
If there is no speaker against , I shall put the matter to the vote directly
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
This item is now entered as the first item on today' s agenda
Madam President , I am sorry to have to request your attention for a moment
Once again , on the agenda
Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs
Democratic Group , which led me to request the rapporteur , Mr Pirker , yesterday evening , to agree to the vote being adjourned until Brussels
Understandably he did not agree to this
With the decision that the plenary sitting has now taken , i
e
be able to vote on it today
That would mean that we would have to vote on such an important report a) extremely controversially and b) with a very small number of Members present
That is not appropriate for the subject of this report
adjourn it until the December part-session in Brussels
Ladies and gentlemen , I believe that we are going to hear from the rapporteur on the establishment of EURODAC , Mr Pirker , who has asked to be given the floor
the Protocol
That was out of the question and an unreasonable demand , because we need solutions
Now , in the autumn , we have opened the debate with a Council Regulation
want to fight the system as a whole , that we need Eurodac
others that Eurodac must be set up
We must have this discussion and bring it to a conclusion
bear the entire responsibility for us failing to have a well-ordered European system dealing with asylum or a system to combat abuse
They would bear the sole political responsibility for this
(Applause)
If this report is going to be discussed then I would ask that we ensure that it be discussed today and that we also vote on it today
That must be our goal
We would only allow one exception to that
the vote in plenary sitting
I would therefore ask you to ensure that we can discuss it and vote on it today , because there is no time to lose
issue
(Applause)
I quite understand what you have said , Mr Pirker
I think that Mr Watson , the chairman of the Committee concerned , now wishes to make a statement
This proposal for a Council Regulation is an important proposal
to discuss it on 2 December
If we have time to debate this report this morning , then we must vote at lunch-time
This will enable Parliament to give its response in time for the Council to discuss it
support Mr Pirker's proposal that we not vote on the matter tomorrow
It is too important a matter to be voted on a Friday , even though I personally will be here
here tomorrow - we might ask them that
assistance of the Commissioner in intervening with the Council on this matter
Mr Watson , indeed I have been told that the timing is likely to get us into this sort of situation , such that we cannot vote on the report today
And this could cause problems , tomorrow morning , for many more delegations than you just mentioned
Indeed I feel this is not a matter for any specific delegation , and I felt I must make that clear
Madam President , the Commission wishes to stress the importance of the instrument which we are proposing to Parliament
We would like to have political support that is as wide as possible for it
3 December , Parliament' s vote must take place today
If not , we shall have to renegotiate the entire timetable with the Council , and I cannot tell you what the results of such renegotiations will be
Indeed that is probably the most disruptive aspect of work in the Union: one can never predict the outcome of negotiations with the Council
Commissioner , would it still be acceptable it we were to vote on the report on 1 December
Madam President , we have now heard the Commissioner as well
That confirms to me and to all of us that we must vote today
We need Eurodac
We have had Tampere , and we have had a clear statement from the Council and have always had the full support of the Commissioner
As Parliament , we cannot afford in the public' s eyes , to deliberately cause delays
We need the system
We should therefore amend the agenda so that the vote can take place today , as otherwise there would be excessive delays
I would therefore ask you to take a vote on whether the vote takes place today or whether it is adjourned
We need the vote today
Mr Pirker , I feel the best course of action , in fact , is to move on quickly to the report
The faster we go , the greater the chances that it will be possible not only to debate but also to vote on the report this morning
I am keeping in mind what the Commissioner has said
Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou , I must come to you
Would you agree to my proposing to the House , if the House indeed accepts , to rearrange the agenda and deal with the Pirker report immediately before your own
Madam President , I agree , although I hope that there will be sufficient time to discuss my report this morning
Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou , thank you very much indeed
This is very generous of you
I now turn to the House
Do you agree to debate Mr Pirker' s report immediately before Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou' s
(Parliament gave its assent)
Internal OLAF investigations
of 25 May 1999 on the internal investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)
urgency referred to in Rules 50 and 112 , a debate and vote shall not be opened on a text unless it was distributed at least twenty-four hours previously"
Now , I would inform you that the last amendments to the Giannakou-Koutsikou report were distributed yesterday evening
The last translated amendment , the French version of amendment No 20 , was distributed at 9
52 p
m
yesterday evening
away and decide that we can do everything that is urgent as long as we establish that it is urgent
I do not believe that there have even been any proposals tabled on the urgency of this report
of our Rules of Procedure
This is the issue
Thank you , Mr Cappato , for invoking the Rules of Procedure , even if we have already discussed the matter and a decision has been made
I do not think that we can reopen the debate on whether or not the Rules of Procedure are being complied with
Mr President , I hope that the small number of Members who are still present in the Chamber will pay some attention to this report
behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is not being broadcast in any way
What I am about to say is quite important
at the time expressed reservations and demanded further clarification
a special role to Parliament' s President herself , to whom all information regarding the Members will be sent
amendment word for word - "Rules governing Members' parliamentary immunity and the right to refuse to testify shall remain unchanged"
Rules of Procedure , which , in implementation of the provisions of article 10 of the Protocol to the Article I have just mentioned , regulates Members' immunities even more closely
vote for this text with peace of mind
decision that Parliament has to take
The mandate was , and still is , simply the following - the decision to be taken is this: to include the interinstitutional agreement in the Rules of Procedure , i
e
by introducing a new Rule 9b and not to amend the interinstitutional agreement
I would point this out , in particular , to those Members who were not Members of the previous Parliament
May
those amendments that seek to change the interinstitutional agreement , which we are simply required to implement as it is , to be inadmissible in committee
with the identical wording - in the Official Journal of 31 May last year
We have limited ourselves to introducing technical adjustments to allow proper implementation within Parliament
other institutions again , this can easily be done in the future
Nevertheless , today , I think that we have the duty not to deny the signature with which we confirmed our commitment to implementing the interinstitutional agreement
Mr President , two questions need to be answered with regard to the new proposal in the Napolitano report
The first question is: is the proposal in accordance with the rules of the OLAF European Parliament and Council Regulation of 25 May 1999
And the second question is: is the proposal in accordance with the interinstitutional agreement between Parliament , the Council and the Commission
The answer to the first question is an obvious "yes"
The proposal is in accordance with the Regulation
The answer to the second question is not so easy
he obtains knowledge of fraud or clues suggesting corruption but - for whatever reason - does not want to confide in his superiors
We have said that he should then approach OLAF directly
This possibility is now excluded in the proposal before us in the case of Members of this House
That is justified because the Members are protected in a special way by the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities in the performance of their duties
This protection goes further than the protection enjoyed by the Members of the EU Commission through this Protocol
My concern is only that the proposal that officials should approach the President of the Parliament directly , will create more problems than it solves
It is foreseeable that the press will then regularly ask: How many cases are there and which ones
If there are none , they will say that they have intimidated their officials to such an extent that nobody trusts himself or herself any more
If there are some , then they will try to drag each of these cases into the spotlight
series of questions is ignored and only the rights and obligations of the Members is covered
That would have left us time to consider other questions in peace
I believe , nevertheless , that given the difficult circumstances , Mr Napolitano has drawn up a very good report and I should like to support him in the vote this lunchtime
Mr President , I would like to refer to the closing words of the draftsman of the opinion , Mr B√∂sch
satisfactorily
Of course , there were perhaps other possibilities , but in this Parliament there was , above all , one concern: to fulfil the objectives which we had set
That is to say , fight fraud , corruption and any illegal activity which harms our Community
But we are a political Assembly and politicians - as we know well - are subject to all kinds of influences
We have tried to prevent a healthy , specific political objective from being misinterpreted and misused
it contravenes the immunity and inviolability of Members
the characteristics of our own decision
Please allow me to congratulate two people in particular
One is the President of the Committee on Budgetary Control , Mrs Theato , who is in a way the mother of OLAF and of all these regulations
for this difficult solution
often , but not always alas , unfounded
by all the institutions and now applies within each of them except , until today , within Parliament
of the major political groups said that it supported the proposal
raised have been adequately dealt with
and in particular the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities"
without prejudice to the confidentiality requirements that may be laid down for Members of the European Parliament
sort of a new right given to officials to report confidentially on MEPs with wild allegations can rest assured that this is not the case
The reports would go to OLAF , be properly investigated and would protect the position of MEPs
European Parliament
That would be totally unacceptable and would destroy the credibility of this Parliament
It is essential that this report be adopted today
Mr President , I have to say that I fully respect the sincerity and the passion of those who find themselves opposed to this report
Serious cultural problems have emerged inside this Parliament as we have debated the issues involved
and privileges will not be removed without due process
All the points expressed in the various amendments are already sensibly covered
fair regime for the Parliament as for the other bodies
Mr President , if we decide on this Rule of Procedure then it will be easier to combat fraud and to include the Parliament
That would be good , as we have fought for it
here , if not for fraud and corruption but for overall authorisation , and I quote , "to intervene in serious incidents in the performance of one' s duty"
a disciplinary law we do not have and comparable duties that do not exist
political agitation that makes a mockery of an independent mandate and a free Parliament
That has nothing to do with combating fraud
The Council has attacked the position of the Parliament at its core and damaged it
Mr President , up to now there has been a succession of procedural errors which I hope will not work to the detriment of the Parliament in possible court cases
changed
We are always subject to the law and also to criminal law
That must be stressed quite clearly , independently of our internal Rules here
What we are dealing with here is the method by which the controls , checks and investigations are carried out
situation any more
That is the classic principle of the independence of the mandate that has been fought for over many centuries , particularly as protection from the executive
Only in this way is the Member of Parliament able to exercise control
He must have the right to refuse to bear witness , without any 'ifs' or 'buts'
This already applies to us but the ways in which it applies partially negate it
and tell him something if they know that he must not inform on them
the Members of Parliament in one and the same Article
Members of Parliament in control mechanisms can protect this independent mandate and perhaps lead to some other phrasing
This is not possible just now in the heat of the moment and I would ask my colleagues to remember this if it comes up again
speaking time
I had entered my name , I had a lot of things to say , but as a result of this outrageous rigging , I no longer have the right to speak
The debate is closed
The vote will take place at 12 p
m
Eurodac
Regulation concerning the establishment of "Eurodac" for the comparison of the fingerprints of applicants for asylum and certain other aliens (COM(1999) 260 - C5¬≠0082/1999 - 1999/0116(CNS))
the rapporteur
Dublin Convention
agreement , the State responsible is the one in which a refugee first finds safe haven
Up to now control has not been possible because it has not been possible clearly to define a person' s identity
In Eurodac , almost ten years later , we have an instrument that makes possible the clear identification of asylum-seekers and also of illegal immigrants
What is its purpose
The aim of Eurodac is to help implement what was agreed in Dublin
The aim of Eurodac is to establish once and for all which Member State is responsible for the asylum procedure
The aim of Eurodac is to prevent multiple applications and thereby also to stop social abuse and indirectly it has the effect of sharing the burden
And that too is something quite essential
an application for asylum has already been submitted anywhere else
The Member States also have the opportunity of fingerprinting illegal immigrants who are found in the Member State itself for the purpose of comparison
In the discussion , that was very long , very good and very pragmatic , a solution was also reached
proposals for amendment that were such as to completely destroy the Eurodac system
They were rejected
There was also full agreement with the Social Democrats on the system , which we were pleased about
There were proposals for amendment , which aimed to raise the age from 14 to 18 and early cancellation was planned if refugee status was attained
There was a majority here , which was against my opinion as the rapporteur
The report as a whole was deemed positive and was adopted in plenary session
in Europe and for combating abuse
That is all I wish to say with regard to my function as rapporteur
Now , I will speak in my capacity as the EPP spokesman as well
I am against political groupings always trying to present Eurodac as a system that does not help this monitoring , but is a form of criminalisation because fingerprints are taken
young people when fingerprints are taken from the age of 14
Convention and under the protective measures of the Member States
It therefore has a protective function if we also take the fingerprints of young people and this is in full accord with all the Conventions that we possess
The Greens are against the system and I think that they are simply refusing to face up to reality
They will bear the full responsibility if this system and a proper asylum policy for Europe fail
Let me just say something else , that I consider to be especially important
this system
It is remarkable when one is asked as a Christian Democrat to undertake something here against the Left in this House
We need the Eurodac system
over this problem
We also have here a system against asylum abuse , against illegal immigration
If the Social Democrats and the Greens vote against Eurodac , then they will bear full responsibility if there is further asylum abuse and illegal immigration
Mr President , there are days when it seems easy to do one' s job and other days when it is difficult to do one' s job
For me , today is one of the latter , a day on which we have difficult problems to resolve
These problems are of two kinds
Pirker
I shall begin with the latter , because it is logically more fun to discuss politics in Parliament than on paper
If anyone should take the blame here for the fact that we are finding it so hard to find common ground , then it is the rapporteur
You , Mr Pirker , with your proposals for amendments , have from the beginning endeavoured to aggravate the work that the Council has submitted to us , which is already highly controversial
a conservative Austrian , you wish to pursue
(Applause from left)
the whole story should be told
Mr Schily wrote you a letter that he also sent to Mr Nassauer and myself
his point of view as the German Minister of the Interior
us a little more time so that we can finish discussing this controversial subject , in order then to attempt to work with you by consensus
I discussed this with you yesterday evening at 10 p
m
refusing to face up to reality - as you put it so well yourself
This is not the way to create a reasonable asylum policy in the European Union
It must be built on a broad consensus and not on exclusion and confrontation , as you seem to wish
What is our problem
you have used perfectly good arguments that we also appreciate
For example , the system should afford protection to minors , who are smuggled in illegally and who are here forced into prostitution , amongst other things
This kind of fingerprinting system can be seen as giving them a certain police and state protection
Our problem is a constitutional one
Should we not separate those people who , as political victims of persecution claim a basic right to which they are entitled , i
e
their will
Should we not separate this group of people
to wait a fortnight
What if you now say , a year has gone by , for goodness sake , and we cannot wait another fortnight , Mr Pirker
(Applause from left)
So I must say to you that the method you are using is intensifying the debate in this House
That is not a good thing
I will say to you now - trusting in the liberality of the Liberal Group - , that with this strategy you will fail in the long term
For today you have again been lucky , but in the long term this exclusion method will not be successful
We are not against Eurodac , in principle , but we would have liked more time for consultation
You did not want to give it to us
You alone are responsible for this impasse
Liberals in this House have a number of concerns about the draft protocol that was put forward in this draft regulation
It carries a risk that it may blur the distinction between asylum-seekers and other types of immigrants
It carries the risk that it may diminish the protection of those who need it by mistakenly channelling them through normal immigration procedures rather than asylum procedures
There are certain "legal grey areas"
The extension of EURODAC to persons who are not seeking asylum is , conceivably , outside the competence of the Dublin Convention , for example
There is the risk that this protocol , this regulation , may be unworkable
them
Finally , there is a certain lack of clarity in some of the definitions used , like 'irregular crossing' , 'illegally present' and so on
political groups and I congratulate the rapporteur on it
The Liberal Democrats will support this report
in realistic terms with the challenges that we face
Let me say one thing to Mr Schulz who raised the question of liberality
This is a time for cool heads and good argument
Mr Schulz cannot deny that we face a challenge in the Union with the number of people illegally present
We have to find a way of tackling that problem while at the same time protecting civil liberties
We believe that this report achieves that , and that is why we will be happy to give it our support
the previous speakers after rapporteur Pirker' s introduction
There are quite a few reservations and observations with regard to this report , including its lack of a social and human dimension
Many police staff and criminal investigation services will of course welcome this report with open arms as it simplifies their work
We need to be realistic and we do not deny that there is abuse
unwilling to do anything about it
This is untrue
A house is built on solid foundations
somewhat
However , we should not lose sight of the fact that asylum seekers look for safety , need a roof over their head and money to buy food
The proposal' s point of departure is that asylum seekers are actually suspects
It is assumed that they abuse the right of asylum
And this is not proper
Asylum seekers are criminalised here but they are not criminals
Applicants are having a criminal role forced upon them , but are , in actual fact , victims , victims of the situation in their country of origin
Turning now to minimum standards: a control policy as proposed is only acceptable if minimum standards apply across all states with regard to the handling of asylum applications
Applications should be dealt with correctly and uniformly wherever they are submitted
The gap is still too wide at the moment
Needless to say , someone will apply for asylum where he hopes he will find recognition , a listening ear and humane treatment
Finally , I would like to touch upon protective measures for personal data
These measures do not apply to refugees at the moment
This discrimination also promotes criminalisation
Within our Green group , a discussion has been opened on the principle of fingerprinting in general
of the victims
Every effort must be made to stop organised crime in its tracks
Fingerprinting can help us achieve this
Asylum seekers look for safety and a sense of security and do not wish their name to be on display across Europe
Maybe in future , a debate could take place on the role of fingerprinting
Mr President , in our Group we view Eurodac as a drastic departure from the Dublin Convention
concerned only with asylum-seekers
In our view , Eurodac is not a prerequisite for enabling the Dublin Convention to function
balance between control measures and the rights of the individual
This is absolutely crucial
So let it be stated immediately that our Group is opposed to Eurodac
Rights of the Child , as well as on the legal rights of third-country nationals within the borders of the European Union
Taking fingerprints from people , just because they are not citizens of a Member State , is tantamount to wholesale criminalisation of foreign nationals
To mix immigrants and asylum-seekers together in a fingerprint register is a departure from the basic idea of the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees
Asylum-seekers are entitled to ask for protection
It is not a criminal offence to request asylum
And the Dublin Convention in fact relates only to the first country of refuge
propose that , under such a system , fingerprints are taken only from people who have been sentenced for having committed criminal acts
It is proposed that 14 year-olds should have their fingerprints taken and stored in a register
age at which , generally , a child is deemed to become an adult
If a register is to be established , we want it to be possible to take fingerprints only from people of 18 years of age and over
Fingerprints are something which you take from criminals , and even criminals are entitled to protection
The rules on the erasure of records and the disclosure of information are far too vague in the Council' s proposal
residence permit from a Member State
Let me repeat this once more: we are opposed to Eurodac
We consider this proposal to be a huge boulder in the wall around Fortress Europe , a wall we want to see broken down
of legislation we are debating , albeit to no great legal effect , because this is a simple consultation procedure
I have two points to make
First of all , I have some questions for the Commissioner
but this is not apparent from the proposed regulation
I should like to see this matter clarified and would ask that the clarification be included in the proposal
namely a decision to build upon the Schengen acquis
If so , there is a definite procedure for how Denmark is to be incorporated into the system
Is it this rule which is to be followed , or others
And finally: if it is this rule or other rules which are to be followed , what would be the consequences of a Danish accession
Is it the case that decisions by the EU authorities , including the European Court of Justice , are binding upon Denmark
The second point is the fundamental and most important one
As Pernille Frahm rightly said , this proposal concerns an extension to Fortress Europe
asylum seekers , and for a group of other foreigners without , moreover , there being the right to differentiate between them
States and the Commission
tradition , and we have had our share of repressive systems
And what is interesting and sinister is that it is wrapped up in phraseology which would have made the late propaganda Minister , Joseph Goebbels , turn green with envy
an Area of Freedom , Security and Justice and which guarantee freedom of movement
only real amendment proposed - to replacing the concept of a foreigner with that of a citizen of a third country
Is the reason for this that the concept of a foreigner has negative connotations
What the realities of the situation are is not so important
What is important is the packaging
You are welcome to it , is what I say
the problem which we are focusing on today can hardly be overestimated
We therefore give our full support to the Eurodac database for fingerprinting being set up
a good step in the right direction
case , but rather it should make it more difficult or impossible to abuse the asylum system in the future
I therefore regret that Parliament has further mitigated the already weakened and moderate Council proposals in its various amendments
It is completely beyond me why both the Council and Parliament are still a great deal laxer on illegal immigrants than on alleged asylum seekers
only be used for comparison with new asylum applications within the two-year period
responsibility of footing the bill for a certain level of illegal immigration and abuse of the asylum system , rather than to render such abuses completely impossible
Finally , I would put a big question mark over the fact that it appears that some sort of office of the European Commission will manage the system
In my opinion , it should be assigned to a European police body such as Europol
Mr President , I would like to ask you to take note of the fact that in this building there are meeting rooms with no screen
not too much trouble
Mr President , our Group has significant doubts , and reasonable doubts , in relation to the EURODAC report presented
European Union
We have a new proposal , this time from the Commission , which makes important advances
the European Union
is shown that a person has already applied for asylum
are in an illegal situation in a Member State
Therefore , we believe that a little more time is needed to carry out the proposed extension of the EURODAC system
What we are clear about is that it is not acceptable to apply it to minors
In this respect we will stand firm
We will demand that this system be applied only to adults , because minors require other legal provisions if they are not accompanied
And if they are with their family , that family will enter the system
Thank you , Mrs Terr√≥n i Cus√≠
We take note of your request
There is no doubt that an intelligent building must show intelligence throughout
Mr President , the whole principle of fingerprinting asylum-seekers , as far as I am concerned , is intolerable
It is basically criminalising victims , people who are seeking asylum and refuge
Instead , our priority should be to improve the situation of asylum-seekers in the Member States
In my own country at the moment the situation for asylum-seekers is completely intolerable
Just this week the Minister for Justice has announced that he is going to prosecute taxi drivers who carry illegal immigrants
Basically what we are doing is promoting the whole attitude of xenophobia and victimising people who are already victims
The report tries to make the protocol sound less threatening , but the principle is exactly the same
We are criminalising victims
Fingerprinting is something that is normally done to suspected criminals
Suspected criminals at least have the advantage that they will have legal representation , they will know their rights
These people will not know their rights , not have legal representation
The protocol does not explain where and how fingerprinting will be done
Will it be on entry into the country , before the border is crossed
If this is the case does that mean that anyone , anywhere , can be stopped
This is basically in line with the Dublin Convention
It was something set up in secret , behind closed doors , unfortunately in my own country - which I am very sorry about
It basically promotes the whole idea of a fortress Europe , keeping out the so-called undesirables , whereas we should be looking at why people are seeking asylum , not victimising them
One of the improvements aimed at here is on age
The idea is that fingerprinting 14-year-old children is completely unacceptable
But even at the age of 18 or 21 it is still unacceptable because these people are not criminals
You are making the assumption they are
The whole principle of the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty seems to have been done away with here
The attitude within the European Union towards asylum-seekers has to change
What we are doing is encouraging the xenophobia that is growing throughout the Member States of the European Union
That is a tragedy
Mr President , the Eurodac project shows the true face of liberal Europe
A fortress of suspicion and police repression aligned against the persecuted people of this earth
The computer database of fingerprints is an infringement of individual freedom
It systematically treats asylum seekers as suspects
It calls into question the inviolability of the documents held by the bodies responsible for handling asylum requests
It contravenes the legal protection to which refugees are entitled
Applying even to children as young as 14 , it contravenes the International Convention on the Rights of the Child , specifically article 10 thereof
Who here would dare take the fingerprints of a fourteen year-old kid
The Eurodac project makes criminals of the immigrants who find themselves without proper papers , without status , often because of the diversity of laws between countries
Basically , it contravenes all international conventions for the protection of human rights
With this , fortress Europe is committing the crime of failing to assist refugees in danger
Is this so surprising for a liberal Europe which arms the Ankara dictatorship with combat helicopters , while at the same time rejecting Kurdish refugees
Eurodac must of necessity be rejected
Mr President , the report provides me with the opportunity to comment in this House on the unjustified rebukes against us non-attached Members case by case
The assertion that we are adopting a restrictive position on asylum , of which the rapporteur was also accused today is simply wrong
Our position is quite clear
our policy is based on the Geneva Convention relating to Refugees
Of course we consider it absolutely necessary to provide temporary protection for displaced persons
Anyone who needs protection should be protected
What we do say , however , is that the unsuitable migration policy has led to social problems in conurbations , which we as serious politicians should not ignore
This criticism must be permitted in a democratic structure
for the Dublin Convention and Eurodac
We shall therefore vote in favour of the report
The rapporteur in his introduction said that the objective is to implement the Dublin Convention and have a system of fingerprinting
My group agrees in principle with that , but we want some safeguards
Mr Pirker also said that the purpose was to ensure that there are no social abuses of the system
the authorities either
country nationals
I shy away from the use of the word 'foreigners' , or indeed the word that was used in the translation of the English text
In English 'aliens' are people from another planet and to be perfectly honest we do not have much of a problem with that at the moment
little sympathy with them either
achieve legitimate status the data collected is deleted
compromise
Mrs McKenna in her impassioned speech a few moments ago said that we must ensure that asylum seekers and others are not treated as criminals
Certainly we want to ensure that this new system is used to assist the most vulnerable in our society
no reason at all
they need help and assistance
and with considerable compassion to help and support the most vulnerable in our society
Convention which determines which Member State is responsible for considering an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States
The Tampere European Council has called for work on EURODAC to be concluded rapidly , and the Commission considers in fact that EURODAC is an important instrument
of multiple asylum applications , it will make easier our task of promoting high and fair standards of asylum
Once the EURODAC Regulation has been adopted , it will be incumbent upon the Council to make similar progress in respect of other asylum instruments
I , myself , will shortly unveil a proposal for a legal basis for the European Fund for Refugees
to give a human dimension to the asylum policy of the Union , as one Member of the House requested just a few moments ago
procedures
I shall also unveil a new proposal on temporary protection which will draw on our experiences during the Kosovo crisis
Progress on the EURODAC Regulation must be accompanied by real progress in other areas so that we can gradually attain our goal of creating a common European asylum system
A proposal which provides for the systematic fingerprinting of asylum seekers and certain other categories of third country nationals clearly raises sensitive and difficult issues
We therefore need to ensure the highest standards of fairness and transparency for all those affected by the regulation
In particular the most rigorous of data protection standards are required
Treaty Article 286 on data protection arrangements for the Community Institutions
It is up to the authority provided for in Article 286 to ensure the appropriate and adequate use of these data and the application of Community rules
We also introduced new provisions on monitoring and evaluation under which the Commission will report regularly to the Parliament and to the Council on the concrete functioning of EURODAC
I am grateful to the Committee on Citizens' Rights , Justice and Home Affairs and to their rapporteur , Mr Pirker , for the report on the EURODAC Regulation
The report contains a number of useful amendments which I believe will help us to improve the text of the Regulation
also covers stateless persons
We can also accept amendment No 2 to the title which introduces a reference to the Dublin Convention
of origin or used within a Member State for an unrelated purpose
analysis - if they have requested a demand for asylum in another Member State
The two issues which have been of most concern to the Parliament are the minimum age-limit for fingerprinting and the rules on erasure of data from the central database
it clear that fingerprinting must be carried out in compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child
Migratory movements of people seeking protection unfortunately involve minors
We need to ensure that our arrangements for determining responsibility for asylum applications take account of this reality
In addition , the age-limit of 14 years was a compromise reached after difficult negotiations
I do not want to reopen the discussion and risk ending up with an even less acceptable solution
covered by the regulation has obtained legal status
regulation
Indeed , the intention behind the current text is that this data should be erased as soon as the person concerned obtains any kind of residence permit
This would include someone who has been admitted as a refugee or under a subsidiary form of protection
I cannot go that far in relation to data on asylum applicants , but I can accept some of the amendments that have been put forward
there
But I can accept the amendment which provides that data on asylum applicants should be erased when the person concerned is recognised as a refugee
Some Member States consider that a problem arises if people who have been recognised as a refugee in one Member State travel to another Member State and claim asylum there
phenomenon
I believe that we should take a different approach
right to reside in a Member State other than the one in which they were recognised as such
one Member State may reside in another Member State
I therefore agree that we should now provide that data on recognised refugees should be erased from EURODAC
Finally , the regulation will not apply to Denmark
This results directly from Denmark's protocol to the Treaty
The Commission does not consider that EURODAC is a measure to build on the Schengen acquis under Article B of the Danish protocol
We understand that Denmark nevertheless may wish to participate in EURODAC , but it remains to be seen what legal formula could be adopted in that case
The amendments which I propose to accept will strengthen the text of the regulation and I am very grateful to Parliament for the important contribution it has made
Thank you very much , Commissioner

EU action plan to combat drugs
(2000-2004) [COM(1999) 239 - C5-0093/1999 - 1999/2095(COS)]
Mr President , this debate follows the communication to Parliament of the European Commission' s action programme to combat drugs between 2000 and 2004
This programme is not of course a magic recipe which will solve the drugs problem
help bring about both short- and long-term improvements to the current critical state of affairs
Commission itself , as regards the inadequate evaluation of programmes and more general shortcomings in relation to the threat which actually exists
into Europe , while heroin is still the main problem
organisations from Central and Eastern Europe
Unfortunately , communications and the information society help the drugs trade
Clearly , there is no unequivocal solution to this tremendous problem
and rehabilitation of drug addicts , so that we can help make prevention a success or at least stabilise the situation
The proposal of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs is therefore quite clear
We consider that greater political will is needed , Mr President , and greater political will mean that we declare war on drugs and drug traffickers without compromise
Secondly , we have noted that there is a lack of fundamental coordination
within the Union and establish a climate of international coordination
the same respect as and is on a par with the human rights clause should be included in all agreements with third countries
Without greater political will , without this type of initiative and without a more general policy at European and worldwide level , there will be no results
The increase in the drug problem cannot be blamed solely on present economic and social circumstances , poor standards set by parents or television
It is a far more complex , far more widespread problem
of the matter would therefore be a serious mistake
Organised crime , Mr President , Commissioner , is running at a faster pace than its prosecutors nowadays
It is precisely , therefore , at the political level that we must step up our action
The policy on drugs must be mainstreamed
It is not only a policy matter for the Ministers of Health
It is not only a policy matter for the Ministers of Justice
in and movement of drugs
stabilise the situation in due course
Because drugs , Mr President , will be with us for a long time to come
threat and stand up to it
Mr President , the plan of action on drug control has been discussed within the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy
I would like to establish here once more that the plan of action met with a great deal of appreciation in our Committee
The prevention of drug abuse is necessary and it is essential to bring down the demand for drugs
deemed it not to be its task to go into this aspect in any depth
Hence , the opinion focuses on the Committee on Industry' s key topics , namely trade and research
As far as external trade is concerned , the Committee on Industry is aware that the trade policy can only do so much in the fight against drugs
Driving back poverty in the producing countries is an important part of the fight against drugs
Trade instruments should therefore be deployed , in addition to other aid programmes
The Committee on Industry is also aware , of course , that the drugs topic within the Union and within this Parliament is a controversial one
There is not really a European approach
There are different approaches of Member States and there is a multilateral strategy within the UN context
It is because of this controversy that the Committee on Industry is of the opinion that headway can be made by means of independent research
Research can indicate which strategy and programmes proved successful and which did not
Based on these facts , maybe we can bridge our differences
One of the points of difference concerns the approach adopted at UN level
This approach is viewed by many as too repressive
Others , on the other hand , are of the opinion that this fight cannot be fought hard enough
The fight against drugs equals war
The Committee on Industry concludes that the general principles of the UN approach are undisputed , but all the more so the policy
This is why the Committee on Industry is urging a thorough evaluation of the multilateral policy and the treaties based thereon
It is regrettable that this conclusion is not included is Mrs Giannakou' s report
Finally , the Committee on Industry would like to express its appreciation to the Lisbon Observatory
Thanks to the findings of the observatory , we may well be able to look beyond our national preferences
The Committee on Industry hopes that the Observatory can remain a base for further development of a European approach to the drugs problem
Thank you very much , Mrs Corbey
The Commissioner has requested the floor now because he cannot attend the debate
Therefore , Commissioner , you have the floor
The Commission will of course be present during the debate this afternoon , but I will not be there personally
Despite considerable efforts to prevent drug abuse and addiction the drug problem continues to pose threats and challenges on the eve of the year 2000
The most serious health problems are caused by the use of opiates and , in particular , heroin , amphetamines and multi-drug use
Cannabis is still the most commonly used illicit drug in the Union
Infectious diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis B and C have reached high prevalence amongst intravenous drug users
Organised crime plays an increasingly dominant role in drug production and trafficking
We have to respond to these challenges
of their work and the speed with which they have commended the Commission's communication on combating drugs for the period 2000 to 2004
This will allow the Helsinki European Council to adopt an efficient strategy against this disturbing phenomenon
number of serious drug-related crimes , including money laundering and illicit traffic in precursors
alcohol and tobacco use
Training of professionals from social , health , education and law enforcement sectors is a prerequisite for effective action
In the field of supply reduction , the emergence of new synthetic drugs makes it necessary to find ways to respond quickly to the appearance of new substances and consumption trends
in this area
Efforts to curb money laundering have to be intensified through the rapid adoption and subsequent implementation of the recently proposed amendment to the money laundering directive
illicit drug trafficking
In the past , Member States and the Commission have given insufficient priority to the evaluation of anti-drugs activities
This must change
Evaluation must become an integral part of the European Union approach
The Commission has already begun this evaluation and hopes to do more in the future
The observatory in Lisbon can contribute by issuing guidelines for the evaluation of demand and supply reduction activities
important role in this context
Adoption of the European Union drugs strategy for the first years of the new millennium is not the end of the debate
I understand that the coming Portuguese presidency will implement the European Union drugs strategy through the presentation of more concrete priorities for the years 2000-2004
strategy , possibly at the beginning of next year
I hope that on that occasion we will be able to evaluate the inter-pillar Council meeting that has been suggested by the rapporteur
the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1998
The observatory in Lisbon and Europol in The Hague are two important instruments that can contribute significantly to our strategy
drugs strategy
Thank you , Commissioner
We will interrupt the debate at this point to proceed to the votes
This debate will resume at 6
00 p

Vote
will not be taking part , although they are present , in the votes today either
that cannot teach democracy , as it would like to do and should do , to many countries that , this very morning , we have condemned
financial year (C5-0257/1999)
Parliament , to reallocate EUR 25 million in the financial framework as opposed to the overall transfer proposal
The Commission regrets that the Council has not yet approved Parliament' s proposal
be made available for urgently needed foreign policy programmes
Thank you , Mrs Schreyer
I am sorry that the Council is not represented here
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
the internal investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)
(Parliament adopted the decision)
to the WTO Millennium Round (COM(1999) 331 - C5-0155/19 - 1999/2149(COS))
Madam President , before we proceed to the Schwaiger report vote , could I raise a point of clarification
not have been
The words in the English text that we want to vote on separately are "and socially balanced": those are the separate words
Some versions suggest we should also vote on the word "fair" , but that should be in the main part of the text
I hope that is clear
Relating to Amendment No 11
Madam President , I have the impression that the vote should first be taken on the phrase "that free and fair world trade" etc
Is that correct
Have you included that
Mr Schwaiger , I have received requests for split voting , and for separate voting , and I have been asked to take the words "fair" and "socially balanced" separately
I am therefore complying with the requests which have been made
Madam President , this proposal is for us Greens an essential proposal
If "fair and socially-balanced" is omitted , then unfortunately the majority of us will have to vote against this report
If it is dropped , then an essential part of the entire negotiations is missing from the whole report
I just wanted to make that clear once more
second part first
Then we will know whether , as far as the first part is concerned , we can vote together with the large group which proposes this
Mrs Maes , you will acknowledge that it is rather difficult to vote in order to introduce words into a text on which we have not yet voted
I feel we must be logical and consistent in our approach
Mr President , can I make clear that the Socialist Group wants the words "free , fair and socially-balanced" included
We are now voting on Amendment No 11 which deletes them
Have I understood correctly
So we will vote against this amendment and in favour of the original recital
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , don' t get so worked up
This is an essential point which is really important
From the voting point of view , Mrs Maes is quite right
Mr Chichester , I am surprised that you of all people wanted to have the point "socially-balanced" voted on separately
We voted for it by a large majority in the Committee
However , the only thing that I should really like to see is that the voting procedure runs properly
I would therefore ask you to grant Mrs Maes' request
Madam President , I believe we are dealing with three adjectives
Free and fair world trade is the basis for the WTO Negotiations - that was my original text
A proposal for an amendment was then agreed in the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , where "socially-balanced" was added
The opinions differ as to which adjectives should be added
I feel in any case that it should be "free and fair world trade"
Everyone agreed to that
The question of "is socially tolerable" or "socially acceptable" was disputed
We should therefore vote on the original text saying "free and fair world trade" and then vote separately on "socially-balanced"
Then we would have a result on the third point
we should now vote
I think there is some muddle
The amendment is not the text you read out , Madam President
The amendment concerned involves removing some words
What we have to do is make a decision as to whether or not these words are to be removed
That is the amendment
And the second part , is the sentence that follows on and not the sentence which was read out
What we are voting on , then , is whether to remove or keep these words
Exactly , but we are voting on the removal of two words , first one then the other
I propose that we vote first on the removal of the word "fair"
Is it only the words "socially balanced" which are to be removed
President , we can only vote on the amendment in front of us and the amendment in front of us asks for four words to be deleted
We will vote against that amendment
No other amendment is possible
I will explain as carefully as I can
The original text says , and this is the original text as voted in committee: "Whereas free , fair and socially-balanced world trade must be further developed and consolidated" etc
Amendment No 11 says in its first part: "Whereas (delete four words)"
We are ready to vote on that
I have said that we will vote against it
There is then a further amendment to Amendment No 11 , which is in two parts
But I think we can vote the whole of Amendment No 11 now , which deletes the four words "free , fair and socially-balanced"
No-one has agreed to an oral amendment of any sort
Madam President , I should like to repeat once again that there was a proposal for an amendment by the PPE
a vote on that
The third question is "socially-balanced" , "yes" or "no"
We should vote on that
I have now understood what Mr Chichester said to me
Madam President , my request was a clarification
vote on the words "and socially-balanced" separately from the rest of the text
I am not proposing an oral amendment
We should proceed to vote the amendment first
Depending on the result of that , my point is that I am proposing a separate vote on the original text
So I am not proposing an oral amendment
I think that that clears matters up
We have this Amendment No 11 from the PPE Group for the removal of these words , and this is what I shall now put to the vote
This is not the opportune moment , I feel , in the middle of a sitting , to want to put the finishing touches to an oral amendment
Indeed I can see that Mr Chichester has the wisdom to abandon this course
Madam President , I am speaking now because I believe that I can propose a solution that is quite correct
We are dealing with three terms: fair , free and socially-balanced
Both the words "fair" and "free" are as far as I can see desired by a large majority
The only disputed point is the term "socially-balanced"
the majority opinion of the Parliament on each of the three words
The request itself is unclear
Ladies and gentlemen , I appeal to your understanding
The important thing is that we know what we are voting on
a subdivision
Madam President , our Rules of Procedure do not allow for a secondary market in amendments
The Group of the Party of European Socialists strongly opposes
the underhand introduction of an oral amendment , with the excuse of clarifying an issue
Oral amendments require the acceptance of the groups and this group is opposed
Voting cannot be done √† la carte
Mr Bar√≥n Crespo , if I have understood properly , there is a request for an oral amendment
But there is no need for Members to stand up , matters are perfectly clear
The request for an oral amendment is rejected
We take good note of this
I shall now put to the vote Amendment No 11 tabled by the PPE Group
This involves removing the words we have been talking about
Relating to Amendment No 25
Madam President , this is about Amendment No 25
voted on as a supplement
And , because it is entirely compatible , we should vote in favour of it
Relating to Amendment No 18
agricultural sector do not have an adverse effect on the economies of developing countries and that security of food supply should be considered as a multifunctional aspect of agriculture"
You will see that the French version says the opposite
This may happen more often than we think but fortunately this was noticed on this occasion
Please vote bearing in mind the English original
Absolutely , Mrs McNally
My impression is that the Members of this House are very attentive
Indeed they often point out problems of this kind , which are of course most regrettable
Following the vote on paragraph 29
As a point of order , Madam President , Rule 117 stipulates that either one language or the other must be used
But the French version is peppered with English expressions which make the text quite incomprehensible
to pervade everything
But if you are going to claim to be using the French language , then French terms must be used
the ILO' s Declaration" to "WTO agreement on investment"
I am terribly sorry
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(C5-0143/99 - 1999/2135(COS))
Madam President , so as not to delay the debate too much , I would like to make an overall comment regarding all my amendments
I submitted a great number of amendments in French and signed them myself
Now , I see that the French version which has been distributed officially is not identical to the version I gave to the services
This is not right
It is not a translation problem
Somewhere in the sessional services there is an anonymous reviser who goes around correcting the ideas of the Members of Parliament
I should like the version which I signed and submitted to the sessional services to be restored
Mr Berthu , there is no wicked anonymous reviser
of the House may see the facts for themselves
I have been fully informed of this problem , and we apologise for it
Following the vote on Amendment No 70
to the vote collectively
You may seek the agreement of Parliament before doing so
Such a set of amendments may relate to different parts of the original text
This was introduced into our Rules precisely for this sort of situation
We should now be able to vote en bloc on the rest of Mr Berthu's amendments
Mr Corbett , I have examined the problem thoroughly
In all sincerity , I do not think I am entitled to do so , since that would force me to put the subsequent amendments to a vote en bloc
On the other hand , Mr Berthu who has asked for the floor is perhaps going to tell us that he is withdrawing his amendments
This would be the simplest solution
The decision is , of course , his
Following the vote on Amendment No 50 Berthu (UEN)
(FR) No , Madam President , we did not request voting by roll call in order to facilitate the voting
Having said that , I wish to retain my amendments
There is no text prohibiting a Member of Parliament re-submitting amendments he considers politically important in plenary , even if they are rejected in committee
I am therefore entitled to do so , and I wish to retain them
Madam President , this is the fourth time that an amendment from the EPP Group has been voted against by the EPP Group
tabled amendments to this report , supposedly in the name of the group before wasting our time in plenary
(Mixed reactions)
Relating to paragraph 17
Madam President , before we go on to Amendment No 5 , I should like to point out that we have not quite finished voting on paragraph 17
There was a request from our Group for a split vote on the last few words
last few words of the paragraph
of the members of his Group
This would surely be a great improvement
Ladies and gentlemen , this late in the morning , we need a little humour
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
must in the normal procedure be voted on this afternoon or early tomorrow
The same applies to Mrs Giannakou' s report
Two unusual things that will hopefully not be left to some chance majority
on this
Mr Schulz , we heard the Commissioner this morning speak on the subject of Mr Pirker' s report
to note in the past
I shall ask Mr Pirker
You wish to vote this evening of course
Madam President , the same applies to my report
We have to go to Helsinki with this
So , tomorrow , we need to proceed to a final vote
This is the reason why the committee worked so quickly
is slightly different
(DE) Madam President , we discussed Mr Schulz' s proposal this morning and voted on it
For good reasons there was a clear majority in favour of taking the vote today
have come a year later
That would be irresponsible and there was therefore a clear decision by the Parliament to take the vote today
Mr Pirker , I must interrupt you , as I have a proposal to make to you
Since we have now considerably overrun our time , more or less
I propose that we vote immediately on the Pirker report
We can do this very quickly , in fact
Count on me
"Eurodac" for the comparison of fingerprints of applicants for asylum and certain other aliens (COM(1999) 260 - C5-0082/1999 - 1999/0116(CNS))
Relating to Amendment No 3
for the rest with regard to the expression "national of a third country"
I would ask that there be a separate vote here
, and we will re-introduce these , if necessary
Madam President , we shall now have to work very accurately , otherwise the report will have a completely different meaning
If I have understood Mr Pirker correctly , he would like to reject the definition of a "national of a third country" and the age of 18
Is that correct
Please could he just explain that
Madam President , may I explain
I should like the expression "national of a third country" to remain in the text
We had it just now in a paragraph
I should nevertheless like the opportunity of voting in one paragraph on the age limit
Because we have declared that we support the age of 14 , but there are other opinions , namely to retain the age of 18
That is to say , I therefore request a separate vote
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Mr President , I have been trying since before the last vote to get the attention of the Chair
It seems I have to come down to the very front to do that
It is ridiculous
I wanted to put that on the record because normally , if I make a mistake on a vote , I put it in writing afterwards
I made a mistake
My vote registered that I was in favour of the resolution on the Intergovernmental Conference
I was very much against it
I would like that put on the record now , rather than tomorrow , because it is of fundamental importance to me , coming as I do from a neutral country
I find it very difficult to get the attention of the Chair
When you are up there you seem to just look at the front and the centre
It is very difficult to get attention , which is quite frustrating
Thank you very much Mrs McKenna
We shall proceed in accordance with your wishes
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Report: Napolitano (A5-0006/1999)
Mr President , the result has come about after a whole series of infringements of the law
The provisions of the Rules of Procedure have been infringed on many occasions by the departments and by the majority of the Parliament
officials
I shall , however , not let my own Parliament make me into an official
moreover obliged to inform on people , then such a rule affects the independent mandate most profoundly
will submit this matter to the European Court of Justice
- (FR) We have no intention of sanctioning the European Anti-Fraud Office
lack of any indications as to how the Office itself will be monitored do not inspire the slightest confidence in us
all those elected today , but also all those who have any responsibility at whatever level , from the top of the scale to the bottom , including the Commission in Brussels
though there is no real , democratic supervision
and simple administration , for that is the best kind of administration for the purposes of discovering irregularities and acts of fraud
from being swept under the carpet
be interpreted in terms of our not wanting to regulate the fight against fraud at all
governments
They also condemn fraud or the misappropriation of public monies , the money stolen from European taxpayers
France , the Paris Mayor' s office , Elf or Gifco
This list is , alas , far from complete
They will , however , be voting against the Napolitano report
Because they are sick to death of the self-flagellation that this Parliament indulges in , alternating with lessons in morality and a haughtiness that is just as hard to bear
Because they think that OLAF is an excuse to recruit yet another team of officials , costing more than the cost of the fraud itself
Because , above all , they consider that there already is a structure capable of taking on the role which OLAF is expected to fulfil
The solution , obviously , is to give the Court of Auditors jurisdictional power and adequate human and material resources to take on this role
This is the case of many national audit authorities , not only in France , but in other Member States
condition that he barks loud enough
In this matter , as in many others , Parliament has made itself look foolish
protection
With this in mind , OLAF should finally be able to commence its work
Commission , the Council and Parliament and moreover attacking the independent mandate of the individual Members of Parliament
of possible cases of fraud ,
shall
inform without delay
" then this compels them to inform
The planned form of monitoring by OLAF can only be a transitional solution and our agreement will only serve to set the necessary monitoring in motion
goal
- (FR) There is indeed corruption
Both in the left wing in power and in the right wing in government
Mutuelle nationale des √©tudiants de France or Dominique Strauss-Kahn

states
going to be supervising the Parliament , whereas it is Parliament which should be doing the supervising rather than being its target
Finally , OLAF does not attack the causes of corruption , which lie in the removal of national borders allowing freedom of movement for drugs money , fraud and financial crime
If we really wish to fight the simple symptoms of corruption , while respecting the foundations of legitimate societies , then there are just two ways:
either the technical route , by transforming the European Court of Auditors into a court of law and a court of budgetary discipline;
"National Accounting Office" (NAO) or the American "General Accounting Office" (GAO)
The latter are powerful autonomous supervisory bodies , but are located at the heart of the parliaments , and have a staff of up to 5 ,000

Report: Schwaiger (A5-0062/1999)
In our view , the preparations for the forthcoming round of international trade negotiations is not at all satisfactory as regards procedure , and this is due to at least three reasons
Firstly , we can see the European Union weakening its own position , according to the familiar process , by means of its internal discussions , even before the start of negotiations
by the Agriculture Council of the 27 September , which was itself only partly satisfactory since it omitted the principle of Europe' s autonomy in terms of foodstuffs
We come down a notch at every stage
There are many more possible examples
Thus , regarding our preference system for importing bananas from overseas , the Commission has just made proposals which meet with American demands even before the opening of the Seattle Conference
reduce our claims even before starting discussions with our competitors
are clearly in the remit of national authorities
Admittedly , it is a mandate for the framing of negotiations and not for the consequences of these negotiations
parliaments , but still without clearly declaring this , obviously
We are currently drifting off our course in the fog , without knowing exactly at what point we are going to go over the edge
Then we will be told that it is too late
Such methods are perfectly reprehensible
Uruguay Round
There too we shall be advancing in the dark
The Commission did , admittedly , give in on one point , since it is going to proceed to the evaluation of the impact on sustainability , as I was saying , i
e
on the environmental consequences of liberalisation
That is all very well
models
For these three reasons , in these circumstances , we are unable to approve the opening of the Seattle negotiations
Mr President , the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance abstained on the report , which it considered rather wet
As far as we were concerned , the objective of this report was to give Commissioner Lamy a specific negotiating mandate for the Round due to open in Seattle
Well , such a specific mandate has not been adequately asserted
and considers but does not give any sort of mandate
it
The report , thus amended , has significant weaknesses regarding TRIPS
We can find nothing acceptable to us in it on the subject of intellectual property rights relating to trade
regulations must be drawn up in this field , and this is equally applicable to the settlement of disputes
The report does , however , include some fundamental principles which we consider essential such as the precautionary principle , regulations on production methods and procedures
developing countries
tone , you will find that we Greens will defend this text most fiercely if Commissioner Lamy should step below the recommendations made here
- (SV) Free world trade is necessary in order to increase worldwide growth and help reduce the gulf between rich and poor
However , large numbers of the poor in the developing countries have still not benefited from free world trade
We therefore share the view expressed in section B that the developing countries' interests and problems must have priority in any extended system of free world trade
The free trade system is urgently required if we are to reduce poverty and create a more just world
direction in relation to the Commission' s communication
multilateral trade negotiations where new possibilities are opened up in Seattle
We think that what is prescribed in this section must become a reality in relation also to sections 5 , 6 and 7
in advance , demands from the other Member States in the World Trade Organisation for a change in our agricultural policy at the Millennium Round
To help achieve this objective of reducing the gap between rich and poor States , frontier defences must be lowered and export subsidies phased out
The overarching objective in section 37 ought therefore to be that of completely phasing out customs duties on non-agricultural products
A development like that would be of greater help to the developing countries than the marginal preferences they at present have
into its practice
It is therefore important that weight be given to section 10 in the negotiations
- (FR) The European delegation to the WTO negotiations claims to be the defender of the interests of Europe
the planet dry , but all concerned exclusively with increasing their profits at the expense of the workers in their own countries and peoples in poor countries
In mentioning the "workers' fundamental rights" and "protection" of these , particularly in poor countries , the Schwaiger report introduces a touch of cynicism to all the rest
means to eradicate unemployment if their governments were not concerned primarily by the profits of big business and by making owners and shareholders wealthy
As for the claim of being interested in the working conditions and inhuman wages in underdeveloped countries , this is pure hypocrisy
in France , Germany or the United Kingdom
Instead of forcing these multinationals to comply with minimum social legislation , they are going to be content with inviting a few ILO officials as observers to the WTO negotiations
basically is not amenable to amendment
to the outcome , particularly as regards agriculture and the cultural exception
this basis which looks like the lowest common denominator shared by the Member States , will of necessity suffer a decline in the course of the negotiations
that is likely , if necessary , to deter the American side
supposed to be bringing
the international regulations regarding competition
The establishment of universally recognised common minimum standards intended to oppose any action to restrict competition would already represent significant progress
given to Mr Lamy and which merely constitutes a unified fa√ßade that does not successfully conceal the differences in the interests of the Fifteen
Furthermore , the content of the final resolution adopted by the European Parliament today includes many points that are not acceptable to France
Europe is concerned , the forthcoming negotiations are concerned with the future of its social model at least as much as its trade
and stay in control of their own development
For the problem is not knowing whether rules are necessary in world trade
Everyone is agreed on that
The question is knowing whether the rules promoted by the WTO ever since its creation permit fair and sustainable development for all the regions of the world
I shall make two observations:
Firstly , the liberalisation promoted in the previous rounds and the increase in the volume of trade have been associated with an intensification of inequalities in development on a world scale
In theory , the leaps forward achieved by some should drag others along behind , but in fact the opposite has occurred
The African continent' s share in world trade is less than 3%
Liberal globalisation has proved incapable of providing a solution to the problem of development and still less of promoting fair and sustainable development
This is the reason why an assessment of the social and environmental impact of the previous rounds was essential before engaging in a new wave of all-out liberalisation
If it has been rejected so consistently , it is because the outcome would have been negative
seeking to build with them on the occasion of these negotiations
or even its policy of cooperation in the case of the bananas from ACP countries and the outermost regions
parliaments
We would then be witnesses to a real seizure of democratic power
This is why , in the Millennium Round , Europe must champion another vision of the organisation of commerce and world trade
To do so it must assert three main principles:
The first is that the objective of this round must be the reduction of inequalities in development between north and south
In order to achieve this , the rules of the multilateral trade system must take into account the differences between countries in situations and resources
Free trade without taking anything else into consideration means that the strong get stronger and the weak get weaker
with ACP countries , including 39 of the poorest countries in the world
On the contrary , we must reassert the commitment undertaken towards them during the recent ACP-EU Joint Assembly
Europe must go to Seattle with a vision of globalisation which is opposed to that of a unilateral world dominated by a single power
40 years
How could we refuse others what we granted ourselves , after the war , in order to rebuild our industry , our agriculture and our economy
and the institutions established by citizens , because they concern the very identity of each society , should be kept out of its area of competence
and artistic creation , may not be taken into account as part of trade negotiations
We must resist the onward rush towards treating everything in society as saleable commodities
fight AIDS and other serious diseases indicated by the WHO are maintained
Finally we must defend the principle of the hierarchy of standards
governing trade
It must not be possible to condemn a state for applying the precautionary principle , for protecting its environment , or for rejecting imports proved to be produced by child labour
On the contrary , it must be possible to take an appeal against a WTO decision to the ILO or to the competent bodies of the United Nations
the case either for the conventions on the environment or the ILO conventions
Some of these concerns were taken into account by the rapporteur at the end of the debates within the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy
and environmental requirements
Madam President , in the vote on Mr Schwaiger' s report
of NGOs and international public opinion into the debate
these negotiations
For their entire duration , they will remain at the centre of the debates of the European Parliament , I am sure
the liberalisation of trade
But I doubt that this will be the case
and inflicted on all to truly regulated world trade which is of benefit to the whole planet
to developing countries , particularly towards ACP countries , to which we have been linked for 20 years by the Lom√© Conventions
growers , not only in ACP countries , but also the farmers of our own Community in Guadeloupe and Martinique , to bankruptcy
it is poisoning transatlantic relations and because the Union would be sending an unfavourable message to the world as the new trade negotiations are dawning
Who could possibly be against putting an end to the conflict
No one , of course , but not at just any price , not by surrendering unconditionally
lead in the short term to the economic destabilisation of the entire Caribbean
or a European region , such as R√©union , which I know well
the poorest countries and to ACP countries , in particular , abandoning the farmers in our own outermost regions in the process
And yet we have historic links with these countries
Let me tell you , it is not just a matter of generosity
For many of our countries , which are in fact former colonising powers , it is a very powerful moral commitment which we are honour-bound to respect
undertaken with regard to the voters in the French Overseas Departments
poverty in our world
The European Commission and Council should heed our clear intentions in this respect
Conduct for multinationals (amendment 15) be established
achieving "fair and socially balanced" as well as free trade
I am glad they were defeated
Europe against peasant farmers in developing countries is scandalous
I call on European negotiators to respect our resolution in favour of the principle of food security and for no adverse effect for developing countries in the agricultural negotiations
Protectionism by the European Union against the developing world is morally unacceptable and economically short-sighted
It is time for it to end
- The WTO Millennium Round is an opportunity to manage the process of globalisation
Globalisation must be managed in such a way that global challenges are translated into global progress
Specific actions are needed in favour of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , using partnerships to reduce inequalities between rich and poor countries
Multilateral Environment Agreements and other international institutions must be mandatory
I therefore support the view that the Round be concluded as a single undertaking with results being considered globally
I would prefer no agreement to an unfair agreement
and all of this combined in a global perspective as if these were all nothing more than simple "saleable" goods
the total control of world trade , the systematic privatisation of the public sectors and services which still claim to be public , deregulation and free access to public markets
What this means is that we are facing an obviously neo-liberal perspective , which we are not only trying to uphold but also trying to consolidate and strengthen
and in disregard of ILO working standards and of environmental rules that have been accepted throughout the world
This objective has dangerous implications for people' s cultural identity and for the actual development of dozens of countries , particularly the poorest
These facts , of course , are causing growing movements of public opinion which are expressing reasonable concerns and seeking new directions
There is , of course , no question as to the need for international economic regulation
the need for a moratorium on negotiations on international trade relations on the agenda
agreements such as the Lom√© Convention , and it will need to reject the treatment of some human activities such as education and culture as mere goods
As it is so vital , it must be made completely transparent
New MAIs must be stopped and some laws must be definitively revoked , such as the Helms-Burton law blocking Cuba , as they are illegal from the perspective of international law
Now this is quite obviously not the guideline that is currently being proposed to us
This is why , of course , we are voting against the Schwaiger report
With regard to the Schwaiger report , a number of amendments have been adopted which condemn the subsidised export of agricultural products from the EU to developing countries
The VVD (Dutch People' s Party for Freedom and Democracy) recognises that this export can , in some cases , have a detrimental effect on developing countries
This problem , however , cannot be solved by unilateral restriction of the EU Member States alone
Other countries also subsidise their export and will immediately take the place of the EU when it discontinues the practice of subsidised exports
of import levies , the import of these cheap products at the expense of their own agriculture
- (FR) Like all my colleagues , I voted against Mr Schwaiger' s report
account the views of both sides , in order to determine the economic , social , environmental and food safety-related consequences of the previous agreements of the Uruguay Round
But we observe that , unfortunately , the Council has just given the Commission its negotiating mandate to go to Seattle , and this makes no mention of any such assessment
When pushed , they are prepared to undertake a study , only a very limited one , on sustainability , but nothing to do with the preservation of our economic and social identities
peoples of WTO member countries
breakdown of rural society
A number of developing countries are starting to suffer from the head-on competition to which agricultural products of the Latin America zone and of the Africa zone are subject
fabric of our country) , bear the brunt of the unfair competition produced by the relocation of some multinational , or even transnational , enterprises
foodstuffs and public health protection
It is essential to define very quickly a European farm model based on diversified , traditional and healthy food , produced from essentially European agricultural products
The principle of Community preference must be defended and , by the same token , the system of export refunds including for products described as "outside annex 1" , i
e
food products produced from European agricultural products whose market price is higher than the world rate
The provision of healthy foodstuffs means that the primacy of the precautionary principle should be clearly established in the context of these negotiations
asserted , with all the consequences of this , as a priority objective for European negotiators to attain
The prime objective for the Europeans , if you listen to the Commission , would be to get ready to make concessions
And indeed that is what the Commission is already doing , even before the negotiations have started , to the detriment of vital European interests
I am extremely worried about the European Commission' s attitude
Indeed , following the Uruguay Round negotiations , we have had a few conflicts with the American authorities
Commission itself , against the interests of European and ACP banana growers , against the interests of European consumers and , of course , against the interests of our farmers and producers
and the United States when the negotiations are due to begin
This is playing into the Americans' hands
the Marrakech Agreement with regard to fundamental social rights , the environment , public health , in the general interest , indeed
But this would mean acknowledging that the Commission handled the latest GATT agreements badly , and obviously that is just unthinkable
international agreements with the ACP countries
Special , do not even think about it
The adjective is one that will make Mr Lamy jump with fright
Report: Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen (A5-0058/1999)
European elections , testifying to the growing disaffection of the citizens with regard to the current running of the Union , etc
" The Committee on Constitutional Affairs , no doubt aghast at such an admission , deemed it more prudent to eliminate this clause , with an overwhelming majority
And my group has not subsequently managed to have it reintegrated
I feel this anecdote is significant since is clearly shows the spirit in which this report was drawn up
are becoming from it
Treaties
It is the same attitude of deliberately closing ones eyes to the facts which prevailed when it came to discussing enlargement
People are acting as if extending qualified majority voting , i
e
extending the powers of coercion over minority countries , was going to solve all our problems
This is serious self-delusion
Standardisation has already gone as far as it can within the Europe of the Fifteen
a Europe of thirty members
Two years ago , the Amsterdam Council already came up against this problem and did not manage to solve it
The forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will be no more successful in solving it if it continues to work on the same bases
The fact is , we need a Europe which is more flexible and accords greater respect to its nations
by proposing twenty-one amendments , all rejected , alas , by the majority in Parliament
But the day will have to come when this House acknowledges the impasse in which it is trapping itself by championing a monolithic Europe
in particular
Consequently we shall not adopt a stance on enlargement
de facto power of industrial and financial groups , this being an essential condition for the people to have real control over their institutions
What is written about the subsidiarity principle in the report could be significantly clearer
sentence at the end of section 17: "The application of the subsidiarity principle , as formulated in the Treaty of Maastricht , must be evaluated
"
desire to provide the principle of subsidiarity with more explicit content for citizens in the EU' s Member States
that the institutional questions are handled by means of a rapid and flexible process , founded upon participation by the applicant States
this important report to have been quite extraordinary , as well as unsatisfactory from a democratic point of view
enlargement
Who stands to gain from further integration of the European Union
pressure to support a more and more autocratic structure
I think not
serve the common interest: i
e
overexploiting workers and achieving maximum profits
Both the proposals of the so-called Wise Men and the Commission' s proposals lead in the same direction
Even greater inequality between the peoples of Europe , between the Member States of the European Union and between the candidate countries
or national opposition to EU decisions which adversely affect the grass roots and which might even affect national interests
contrary , other than to restrict the potential for grass roots intervention , at least where it opposes the choices made by the forces of capitalism in "smaller" countries
defence and security policy when the EU is responsible , together with NATO , for the first act of war since the Second World War , i
e
the attack on Yugoslavia , in violation of every concept of international law
Everyone understands that a currency , in the capitalist world , needs an army to defend and impose it
This is the purpose behind the proposals for a common foreign and defence policy and an armed wing in the Union
So that arms can be used to support the interests of the monopolies against the people of Europe itself and of non-EU countries
by the UNO itself , that all the government and mass media claims were shamefaced lies
and the keeping of records on citizens' political convictions , ideological stance , trade union activity and love life
We are opposed to this EU , this lackey of imperialism and big business , and we are opposed to the reversal which this autocracy means for democracy
The EU cannot change with Intergovernmental Conferences , nor do the proposed negative institutional changes represent a change for the better for the people of Europe
create a Europe of peace and collaboration , friendship and equality between peoples , real democracy and freedom and economic prosperity for the benefit of the workers
- (SV) We consider that the report concerning the preparations in anticipation of the next Intergovernmental Conference is a welcome initiative by the European Parliament
The requirements in the report extend beyond what the European Council considers ought to be on the agenda for the next Intergovernmental Conference
We also consider that it is far-reaching on a number of points
only acceptable procedure when it comes to the constitutional part is unanimity
Section 14 (on the revision of the Treaties): We consider that unanimity shall prevail when the Treaties are revised in accordance with section 13 a
Section 17 (last part): We consider that unanimity shall apply not only in the constitutional part but also , for example , in the case of foreign and security policy
Section 26 , last part , may be interpreted in terms of the provision of reciprocal military guarantees
We consider this to be unacceptable
The EU has neutral and non-aligned States among its Member States
For these , it would be inconceivable that resources should be created for reciprocal military guarantees within the context of the European Union' s security and defence policy
document
combat forces in crisis management , including peace-making) are to be incorporated into the EU' s range of tasks
This demonstrates that the EU is , in the first place , a political , social and economic project , including when it comes to conflict and crisis management
the WEU fully into the European Union
- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against Mr Dimitrakopoulos' s and Mr Leinen' s report
The enlargement of the EU is an historic opportunity to create a peaceful , stable and cooperative Europe
At the same time , it is the EU' s greatest challenge to date
A change to the Treaties is a prerequisite for preparing the EU to admit the new Eastern and Central European countries
It is now 10 years since the Berlin Wall came down
We agree to the timetable which has been proposed so that the Intergovernmental Conference might be concluded by the end of the year 2000
It must not be formalities such as changing the Treaties which postpone admission of the new countries
being approved in the individual countries in accordance with the regulations in the respective countries' constitutions
time frame
We have therefore voted against it
very comprehensive agenda would entail
As members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , we have voted , together with our fellow party members , for and against a range of amendments
We have done so because we want European development to move in a characteristically social democratic direction
This does not however alter our general view of the report
their respective constitutions , should enter into and amend the Treaty concerned
We must also clearly repudiate the idea of the EU' s being made into a defensive alliance
This is not a task for the EU but for NATO
Nations Group
a Europe of Nations Group
However , the minority prior opinion fully covers my points of view , a fact which I should like to be noted in the relevant record and minutes
- (SV) The Intergovernmental Conference is a conference between the Member States' governments
It is the Member States' parliaments which are to decide whether its results are to be approved
We cannot therefore accept that the European Parliament should be given any form of right to make decisions on questions concerning the Treaties
We also oppose the proposal in the report to the effect that the EU should become a legal entity
In the same way , the report' s ideas about creating a military EU are alarming and unnecessary
EU
EU citizens are still focused on the political debate taking place in the national arena
The EU debate is reserved for a small political √©lite
We therefore reject the fundamental features of the resolution
decision in the Council
Treaties
This and many other problem issues fundamentally question the role of the Member States of the European Union as "Masters of the Treaties"
We non-attached Members therefore reject this report
a positive response because:
a new "full" agenda is
the legal system etc
influence
there not being proportionality between population and the weighting of votes
over others in breach of the principle of the equality of all European citizens
That is why I voted against it
for the Community agenda for the near future
sensitive nature of the issues that constitute the raison d' √™tre of the forthcoming conference
- and in the name of efficiency and democratic behaviour , an amendment to the Treaties , particularly in the institutional domain , is being aimed for
of working languages
around the largest and richest Member States
even outright opposition to the solutions that are being recommended
would thus be consolidated as a European pillar of NATO , a position that we also reject
- (SV) I cannot vote in favour of the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen report for reasons which include the following
The report has a clear supranational character
I support cooperation between States , but not the supranational dimension which the rapporteurs advocate and which was clearly rejected in the latest EU election
guarantee the EU' s external borders
resources
No exception is to be made for Article 5 which prescribes a mutual responsibility for intervening militarily if another Member State is attacked
Sweden is militarily non-aligned , aiming at neutrality in times of war , and may in no circumstances take part in common military defence
I consider that it should only be possible to revise the EU' s statute through a unanimous decision in the Council of Ministers
Finally , I consider that Parliament ought to concentrate on the changes which must take place if we are to cope with decision making in an enlarged EU
Report: Pirker (A5-0059/1999)
Mr President , I abstained in the voting on the Eurodac report
I did not vote for it because I do not find the procedure and a number of regulations acceptable
Of course I regret that people have not seized the opportunity of acquiring a wider consensus on this important issue
offer a solution in this respect
everyone is being tarred with the same brush
policy we are aiming for and which would mean that Member States showed solidarity in giving asylum seekers the right to sanctuary
generous and humane asylum policy
Union
In the changes to the Commission' s proposal , which find expression in the report , we see reasons for backing the report
These changes will mean that it will not be possible for minors to be subjected to registration and that the right to personal integrity will be strengthened
- (DA) The Danish delegation wishes to express its full support for the establishment of Eurodac for the purposes of comparing asylum seekers' and certain other foreigners' fingerprints
Eurodac will be a significant tool for ensuring that the Dublin Convention functions efficiently
vote
fully in the Eurodac partnership on an intergovernmental basis
all citizens of third countries who are illegally present
The Council' s endeavour to address fundamental rights by including children aged 14 and above is therefore blind
made of fingerprints to prevent more opportunities for error , this proposal that aims to create a Fortress Europe , closed to other citizens is unacceptable
committed crimes and not from asylum seekers , refugees or citizens of third countries who are illegally present within the territory or on a Member State' s border
principle , none of those people may be treated as a criminal or be suspected of being one
which will serve as a deterrent against actions which are not authorised by the central unit
This is the reason I have voted against this report
- (FR) We voted against Mr Pirker' s report for , essentially , three reasons
Firstly , because the amendments to the proposal for a regulation are far too liberal
monitored on the territory of the Union
Finally , because the text entrusts the management of Eurodac to a handful of Commission officials
You have done away with internal borders
circulate freely , any old how
the real extent of the dangers to which you are exposing the citizens of Europe
role of protecting honest citizens , and to cease giving the irresponsible parties of Brussels any sort of jurisdiction over matters of the police , justice , immigration and residence of aliens
regulation concerning the establishment of "Eurodac" for the purpose of comparing fingerprints of asylum seekers and of certain other aliens
We are quite convinced that extending the Eurodac system to cover groups of aliens other than asylum seekers is not the right way forward

Topical and urgent debate
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance
Millennium Bug: military , civilian and nuclear sectors
The next item is the joint debate on four motions for resolution on the Millennium bug: military , civilian and nuclear sectors:
B5-0268/1999 by Ms Plooij-van Gorsel , on behalf of the ELDR Group , on the year 2000 computer problem and possible Europe-wide consequences;
B5-0268/1999 by Ms Theorin , on behalf of the PSE Group , on the year 2000 computer problem and de-alerting all nuclear forces (B5-0276/1999);
B5-0268/1999 by Ms Hautala , Ms Lucas , and others , on behalf of the Greens/ALE Group , on the year 2000 computer problem and possible Europe-wide consequences (B5-0292/1999);
B5-0303/1999 by Mr Chichester , Mr Morillon , and others , on behalf of the PPE/DE Group , on the Year 2000 computer Bug and its possible effects
Mr President , Commissioner , only 43 days to go to 1 January 2000
A date which many are looking forward to
needed
Within the European Union and the United States , the problems have been identified in good time
However , this has been the case to a lesser extent in Central and Eastern Europe
The millennium problem in the nuclear energy sector should primarily be tackled by the International Atomic Energy Agency
This UN organisation is the designated body for worldwide nuclear issues
However , the IAEA has indicated that it has no funding for specific support to solve problems in Central and Eastern European countries
The question remains as to whether these countries are themselves putting enough money into tackling the millennium bug
Russia , in particular , is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy
Earlier this year , Parliament quizzed the then Commissioner , Mr Van den Broek , concerning the EU' s role in this transnational problem
His reply was that the IAEA has drawn up an inventory of potential problems
I now have three questions for the Commissioner
Firstly , does the Commission have the results of this inventory
If so , I would like to ask the Commissioner to provide an outline thereof
Secondly , is the Commission conducting negotiations with governments in Central and Eastern Europe
What concrete action has ensued therefrom
Thirdly , what is the cost involved to the European Union
I thank you and await your reply
Mr President , nuclear weapons are the weapons of the Cold War , but in spite of the fact that the Cold War is over , nuclear weapons are still there
nuclear weapons
To have nuclear weapons ready for immediate firing is a very dangerous situation , mainly because nuclear weapons can be released by mistake
This has come close to happening on a number of occasions
As recently as 1995 , the Russians mistook a Norwegian test rocket for American nuclear weapons and went onto a full-scale war footing in Russia
Mr Yeltsin had to be woken up in the middle of the night but , very fortunately , the mistake was discovered before he decided to fire any nuclear weapons
firing
nuclear button for many years
He knew how near we had been to unleashing a nuclear war by mistake
that sufficient time might be made for serious political deliberations
These two demands ought to be put into effect immediately
The reasons are that computer errors in nuclear weapons systems precisely at the turn of the millennium can by mistake lead to nuclear war
The early warning systems , which consist of a complex network of satellites , infra-red detectors and horizontal radar rely mainly upon the commercial electricity network
Even if the Pentagon has double-checked millions of computer components , full safety cannot be guaranteed; nor can it be guaranteed in Russia
Because of these serious defects in its early warning system , Russia cannot detect American intercontinental missiles for a period of three hours per day
nuclear fuel
down within two hours if the two reserve diesel generators do not function
Unfortunately , these reserve diesel generators are only 85 per cent reliable
weapon carriers , at least for the period of the turn of the millennium
Great Britain has already taken the decision to do this
Nuclear power stations too must be temporarily closed down or supplied with protective mechanisms at the turn of the millennium
It is this with which the resolution is concerned
carriers) may at the same time be the beginning of serious nuclear disarmament
Mr President , I support this compromise resolution on the year 2000 computer problem
Unfortunately , this resolution is not sufficient to do justice to all the important aspects of this subject
For this reason , I would mention three points in particular that are of great importance
The Japanese government has called on the people to stockpile purchases
That shows that the risk associated with the millennium bug is incalculable , and that also applies to Europe of course
It is a matter of great urgency that instructions be issued on how to act and that we discuss what could happen
Secondly , where is the reply from the EU to the desperate call for help from 27 African states on 21 October this year
They are also asking the industrialised countries for help in overcoming their Y2K problem
Thirdly: The main question is , however , where did they get this problem from
This not only applies to Africa but to other countries in the "developing" world
In all analyses of and discussions on this subject , the developing countries do not play a part
not year 2000 compliant
The serious effect of this will be that food supplies will not be guaranteed and the internal stability of many countries will be threatened
43 days before the turn of the century and we are still far from a solution to this problem
Here we see the dark side of the so-called global village of information technology
Old computers are handed over , along with responsibility
I expect rapid action
That not only applies to the Y2K problem , because the next problem is almost upon us
Many computers have not stored the date of 29 February in the year 2000
a result of nobody being prepared for it
millennium phantasmagoria blown up out of proportion by lobbies with a lot to gain from it , including , occasionally , by exploiting the credulity of their clientele for financial gain
gauge the real feeling of some part of public opinion world-wide
to soothe fears and may therefore prove useful
Neither the age of a plant nor its location , nor indeed the state-of-the-art design are any guarantee of Y2K date compliance
I would not like to be in this building at midnight on 31 December - a mere 43 days from now
Lifts , fire alarms - what would work , if anything
There is a serious point to my jesting
We only have to think about it
This is a modern state-of-the-art multi-million plant
coast , only a few miles across from our most populated east coast
You may laugh , Mr President , but I am serious
It is not a major credible accident I have in mind and I do not mean to be alarmist
But I have to put on record my lack of confidence in the British nuclear industry's safety record
As a sovereign , non-nuclear nation , we in Ireland have a right to self-determination in terms of our people's health and environment
Consultation and communication between our two countries over the years regarding the British nuclear programme have not been good
A certain high-handed arrogance has been apparent despite public relations by Sellafield in recent years
I conclude by saying that all nuclear nations need to state clearly and honestly their programmes for Y2K date compliance , to assure their own and neighbouring nations of their readiness
Even at this late stage it is better we know the problems than adopt a head-in-the-sand approach
The first thing I want to say is how warmly I welcome this Parliament resolution
This will send a clear signal around the world about how seriously we take the Y2K issue , and it will hopefully act as an example for others to follow
Time , however , is clearly running out
That means however good intentions are now there is bound to be a risk of failures
could occur
The higher the level of integration , the higher the level of unpredictability
The situation in Eastern Europe is also far from reassuring
The lack of information coming from there worried the Commission as late as June this year , and the further east you go , the more worrying the situation gets
The safest approach is to turn off these plants at the millennium , but how does Lithuania turn off 75% of its generation capacity from Ignalia
By leaving people in the dark without water
The West must offer assistance , so I particularly welcome this resolution's call on OECD countries to provide resources for this
I will finish very quickly with an anecdote that would be funny if were it not so serious
set up , they discovered Y2K problems
the process
Mr President , I shall answer your questions and contributions on those matters which fall within the jurisdiction of the Commission
The way we see the situation in the Member States , the nuclear candidate countries with nuclear facilities and in the newly independent states is as follows
Let me first point out that very few nuclear power plants do in fact use a computer-based system for the essential part of their safety system
measures have by now been practically completed , as have all works to do with emergency planning
actions of Member States
The case is rather different for some countries of Central and Eastern Europe and some new Independent States , whose response to the problem has been less prompt
Some of them , in fact , did not start to concern themselves with this problem until the end of 1998
considerable number of power plants
plants did not reveal any "bug" problems in the essential safety systems
The Commission provided additional assistance to a number of nuclear power plant operators
We financed European Union expert missions to 3 power plants in Russia and to 3 power plants in Ukraine
Slovakia and Russia
may indirectly threaten nuclear safety by increasing the burden on the operators , as has been mentioned
According to the information available to us , we think that the countries of Central and Eastern Europe have generally made good progress in correcting these systems
have been completed by the end of the year
2000 and the main thing has been to begin to address the problem in good time
This is my answer , and this is our contribution to solving this important problem

East Timor
The next item is the joint debate on five motions for resolution on East Timor:
(B5-0271/1999) by Mr Maaten , on behalf of the ELDR Group , on the situation in East Timor;
(B5-0273/1999) Ms Figueiredo , Mr Miranda , and others , on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group , on the situation in East Timor;
(B5-0280/1999) Mr Seguro , on behalf of the PSE Group , on the situation in East Timor;
(B5-0289/1999) Mr Queir√≤ , on behalf of the UEN Group , on the situation in East Timor;
(B5-0299/1999) Ms Hautala , Ms McKenna , and others , on behalf of the Greens/ALE Group , on the situation in East Timor
Mr President , it has , in fact , been possible once again to reach an agreement between all the political groups and to present a single motion for a resolution on Timor
this problem
to return to East Timor are still taking place
The Indonesian authorities must , as a matter of urgency , make humanitarian action possible , particularly on the part of non-governmental organisations
safely
exist and continue to take place
process of independence and the reconstruction of East Timor
This is why the Socialist Group supports this resolution and this was what I wanted to say
I would like to support very much what the last speaker has just said
blind eye to a lot of what is happening there
The Indonesians must try and halt the militia and their activities in the area
There is also the UNHCR fear that the situation is actually going to worsen
It is not just in East Timor , but also in West Timor where there are still a huge number of refugees - an estimated 250 000 refugees
of incidents in recent times which point to a deliberate attempt to try and disrupt the UNHCR's repatriation programme
It is essential that this programme is allowed to continue
Indonesia itself must facilitate the work of relief agencies and the international forces so as to ensure that peace and stability return to the area
We in the European Union , along with the United Nations , all encouraged the East Timorese to exercise their right to vote in the referendum
What happened after that was completely and totally unacceptable , though predictable
In fact it was predicted long before it happened , and action should have been taken much earlier to prevent the atrocities and the murder of innocent people
Unfortunately , a huge number of people lost their lives because of the irresponsible attitude of the international community
that area murdering and chasing the East Timorese out of their country
It is about time that they had the right to independence - it is what they voted for
Member States of the European Union have to support them - not just with words but also financial assistance
Mr President , the developing situation in East Timor must continue to enjoy the complete attention of the European Union' s institutions
approximately 250 thousand people forcibly displaced to Indonesia and , particularly , to West Timor
entirety
It is equally vital for words to be replaced with action and humanitarian and financial aid to East Timor to actually be provided
The delay in the arrival of the aid promised by the European Union , despite the promises made by the Council and the Commission , is unacceptable
for the reconstruction of East Timor and for its transition to independence
Finally , it is important to reiterate the fact that the decisions on the East Timor independence process are a matter for its people
not for international organisations to replace the people of East Timor but to give them all the necessary support
the agenda and to take the first steps towards the international recognition of the State of East Timor Lorosae and the respective establishment of diplomatic relations
Mr President , this week sees the start of the United Nations transfer of authority in East Timor to UNTAET
They do not have an easy task
show the need for the involvement of the Timorese and the importance of international solidarity
The next two years must be won
Timorese people
They know what they want and have the right to participate from the outset in their country' s construction
in the area
An estimate of the costs of reconstruction has been made - EUR 250 million over three years - and a conference of donors will be held on 17 December
The data that has been made available is very useful for Parliament too
reconstruction
allocated to the reconstruction of East Timor , an amount that should be increased in view of the information provided by the joint assessment mission
many of those we do know about are women and children
The refugee camps are dominated by those militias who , having terrorised East Timor , are continuing to do the same in Indonesian territory
In the meantime , Indonesia is keeping its land borders closed
in Indonesia or return to East Timor
to say that this is our best opportunity to keep the issue of East Timor on the international agenda
their homes and to their land
is responsible for the massacres that have taken place and for the appropriate judicial authorities to punish those responsible
issue that deserves the unanimous attention of all European Members of Parliament
peacekeeping force , but for the ordinary citizen in East Timor and also for the refugees still in West Timor , the situation is still very alarming indeed
situation , for which a solution has not been found in any shape or form
Although the UNHCR are making every effort to bring the people back , there is a great deal of opposition
UNAMET are trying their utmost to protect the people but the militia groups are still active
What is really required is a swift international inquiry into the past events , an international tribunal to administer justice and , in particular , to punish the killers
What is also required , is aid for the reconstruction
This is needed quickly as the rainy season is on its way
Exactly how much money has the Commission earmarked for this situation
namely that the situation on the Moluccas is also becoming untenable
This area too is having to deal with 70 ,000 refugees , 500 killed and a judicial system invariably staffed by militia groups
We have asked for help and we have not really had any reaction to this
Mr President , the Indonesian government appears to be sensitive to international criticism
I therefore welcome the fact that both the Commission and this Parliament are taking action in respect of Indonesia
It would be a good idea for the Commission to pay a visit there to have a look and talk to everyone
Moluccas too , to gain an insight into the events in these areas
At any rate , this item should not be taken off the agenda for a long while , because the people over there are still going through a very tough time
The redevelopment of East Timor , in terms of its extent and its political specificity , is an important task for us and for the entire international community
new state
In this context , I am pleased to see that Mr Sergio Vieira de Mello , the new United Nations coordinator , arrived in East Timor last Tuesday
European Union
You know that the Commission is fully committed to shouldering its responsibilities as regards humanitarian and redevelopment operations
the pipeline" , as it were , in order to complete the work we are currently undertaking on the spot
We have responded to international appeals and have currently made commitments up to the equivalent of approximately EUR 8
5 million in food aid
This is not a negligible amount , and we are attempting to measure out this aid to suit the local capacity to absorb it
Nielson is going to be making at the end of the month to both East and West Timor
The Commission will be represented on the spot , at the end of the month , by the Commissioner responsible
According to our information , the United Nations is managing the large-scale operations in East Timor efficiently
The repatriation of displaced persons is in progress
be completed within 100 days
Subsequently , it shall , of course , be of the utmost important for the East Timorese themselves to participate in all aspects of the process of redevelopment and development
of the necessary institutions will be key elements
After independence , the government will have to determine its foreign policy stance , particularly as regards membership , if appropriate , of the Lom√© Convention
This is the information I wished to give you in response to your questions
The joint debate is closed
The vote will take place at 5

Mr President , Commissioner Lamy has not responded yet to what happened to the resolution we submitted in early October regarding the area north of Timor
There were a few questions regarding this area too
I would like to know when we will receive a reaction because people are in fact waiting for this
The situation there is not as serious as it is in Timor but it is getting increasingly worse
Mrs Maij-Weggen , you have been a Member of this House for a long time
You know the Rules
We have a very strict period of time for urgencies
It is not a Question Time , it is a debate
The Commissioner can choose to reply to those parts of the debate he wishes to reply to
I am sure that in private he would be happy to give you an answer to your question
Human Rights

Moratorium on capital punishment
Africa
nothing worse than physical harm inflicted on individuals
This founding principle of Europe is today being challenged , indeed , by the application of the death penalty in a considerable number of places throughout the world
apply the death sentence
According to Amnesty International , there are 3 ,500 prisoners waiting for execution in the United States , where 68 prisoners were executed last year
and social matters
I prefer to think that , as Victor Hugo said , to close one prison , it is enough to open one more school
ranks of the Philadelphia police
In the same way , Iran , which executed 66 people last year , would have us believe that the dozens of students arrested and the 13 Jews , were spies
The mobilisation of international opinion , as we have seen , prevented the execution of Mumia Abu-Jamal , scheduled for 2 December
But , for the time being , there has only been a stay of execution
We must now seek to have the order of execution revoked definitively
We must widen and intensify our pressure on these countries and hit them where it hurts
be applied
as they set foot there
Rights
Mr President , I belong to a generation which thinks that conventions against torture and discrimination should not be signed just for the fun of it
a fairly neutral and rather polite way
defence of principles
the least , and it is therefore logical that Parliament - which from this point of view has always been quite consistent - must continue to be vigilant
adopt , at least in order to indicate that there is a problem that we must continue to be active on
ourselves in a much clearer way than we have in the resolution
Mr President , we are always complaining and regretting - rightly in my opinion - that the European Union does not speak with one voice on the international stage
has unanimously presented a resolution to the United Nations requesting a moratorium on the death penalty
It is sad that this initiative has not come to fruition and we hope that it will do so during this legislature
this right cannot go unrecognised or be violated
reviewed and whose death sentence we ask to be suspended
rest of society have taken part
I would like to say that there have been a whole series of irregularities in the trial and it appears that the defence lawyer has not fulfilled his commitments
United States holds the tragic and regrettable record for executing people who are later proved to be innocent
What is most tragic and regrettable is the fact that the death penalty exists at all
to life , as we have done in this joint resolution
Mr President , the death penalty is in fact a repugnant relic of a vanished age
millennium
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party has played a forceful role in the fight against the death penalty
In one after another of the applicant States , it is either in the process of being , or already has been , abolished , which is a very positive development
In spite of that , the death penalty is still applied in all too many States
Only last year , 1 ,625 prisoners in 37 different countries were executed , and there are thousands on death row
In the United States alone , several thousand people are waiting to be executed
Some of the prisoners condemned to death throughout the world have committed odious crimes , but that does not justify their being executed
All too often , the death penalty is used for political purposes , and there can be legal confusion and innocent people can be executed
That alone is an argument against this barbaric form of punishment
Nor does the death penalty have any proven deterrent effect
The resolution we are debating is really quite remarkable
It names three citizens who , over the next few days , are to be executed in the United States
Obviously , we are urging the American government not to carry out these death sentences
the world
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party wholeheartedly supports this memorandum , which the UN has initiated
as to give rise to a worldwide moratorium on its use
dignity
Mr President , every year hundreds of human beings are executed in the world - often in the so-called civilised world - at the hands of other human beings
In 1998 it was noted that there were at least 1 ,625 executions in 37 countries and almost 4 ,000 death sentences in another 78 countries
These figures refer exclusively to the information which Amnesty International has been able to collect
The true figure is , without doubt , much higher
Every year an unknown number of people are declared innocent after being executed
wrongly convicted
We will never know how many innocent people there were amongst the approximately 7000 prisoners executed in the United States of America during this century
pardoned
which retain the death penalty - and I quote - "to progressively restrict the number of crimes for which it is imposed"
Does that seem to us to be sufficient
Do we want to be a diplomatic Assembly or a political Parliament
death penalty into the clause on human rights
Perhaps the Council is not in a position to do any more , but what about us
Should we not be more demanding
Should we not be more ambitious
The answer is yes
This is why we are sending this message to the Council and all the nations of the world
The case of the Spanish citizen , Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Mart√≠nez , is a clear example of justice with no guarantees
That is why he is calling for real justice , and that is why we support him today
He wants a new form of justice so that he can demonstrate his innocence , and he has the right to it
But I declare , we all declare together , that no death sentence is a just sentence
None is
I will also end with a biblical quote which is more positive than the one quoted by my colleague
It is a quote from Genesis
Cain killed Abel and nobody disputed his guilt in this horrendous crime
"And Cain said to the Lord: 'every one that findeth me shall slay me'
And the Lord said unto him: 'Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain , vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold'
And the Lord set a mark upon Cain lest any finding him should kill him"
May nobody touch Cain , that was the message
May nobody touch Cain
That should be our ambition: that nobody can execute any human being ever , in any part of the world , for any reason
Nobody
Not even the United States of America
Mr President , we probably do not always feel comfortable in this Parliament , because what is approved is not what we wanted to be approved
However , once again , this Parliament is going to speak to the rest of the world against the death penalty
I therefore feel proud to be here this afternoon and to be able to vote , unanimously , for a condemnation of the death penalty
The death penalty is barbarous
As other Members have said , it is a terrifying fact that many innocent people have been executed
And I do not understand how anybody can live with that on their conscience
In reality today' s resolution talks about three specific cases: firstly , the case of Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Mart√≠nez , a Spaniard , in whose trial enormous irregularities have occurred
I have here a copy of a letter which one of the witnesses sent
Mart√≠nez is convicted of
With this simple source of doubt , it is impossible to condemn a defendant to death
Therefore we ask in the resolution for a new trial and that under no circumstances the death sentence be passed
The second case is that of Abu Jamal
There are many reasons to believe that the trial and death sentence on Abu Jamal were motivated by political factors , above all , because he was a leader
For the moment he has been spared
His execution was set for 2 December
We also demand that this death sentence not be carried out
And we also take up the case of a person who is mentally ill , who was about to be executed and who has been spared
years , as is the case with a Canadian who was due to be executed and , half an hour before his execution , had his appeal accepted in court
This is tremendously cruel and the world cannot accept it
This Parliament must champion the demand for a universal moratorium , if this is not approved now
And to this end we must display our moral authority
of capital punishment into agreements with third countries
But , no doubt , it would also be necessary to seek to convince the members of the Socialist Group that they should be firm on this point
This has not been the case to date , and I therefore wish Mrs D√≠ez Gonz√°lez good luck
Having said that , I think that the heart of the matter was raised by Mrs Frassoni and Mr Salafranca
What we are talking about here is not the issue of capital punishment
This House has shown on many occasions that it was convinced of the need to establish a universal moratorium
What we are talking about here is foreign policy and , more exactly , once again , the matter of the European Union' s lack of foreign policy
I would go further than Mrs Frassoni
There is no ambiguity
On Monday , the Council decided to withdraw the motion it had proposed on the pretext that it reiterated a fundamental article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
On Tuesday , it voted in the texts with the same reference to the fundamental articles of this declaration
Republic of China , the United States and Japan , who succeeded in ensuring that this policy , upon which the Union had already decided , was literally betrayed at the last moment
The central problem before us , then , as a Parliament , is the problem of a necessary joint European policy on security and foreign affairs
One of the first things to ask for is that this dossier is handed over to Mr Solana
which had made a very firm commitment to defending our perfectly acceptable compromise position
and to him alone
including by countries such as the United States of America , which have recently starting championing human rights
especially if they are dark-skinned
We are horrified by the frequency with which the innocence of citizens condemned to death is subsequently proven
for no more death penalties to be carried out
It goes without saying , Mr President , that the death penalty has no place in a democratic society
No-one has the power of life or death over anyone for any reason whatsoever
the individual in the face of the power of the state and , as we know , it is often used to annihilate opponents
death sentences are pending to suspend them immediately and to repeal the death penalty
a chance to defend themselves properly
countries , as called for by other Members
In addition , an immediate worldwide campaign is needed and a worldwide moratorium on capital punishment pending the final repeal of the death penalty throughout the whole world
to take up a stance in favour of the immediate and unconditional abolition of capital punishment is an abdication of responsibility in the face of barbarism
case of the Iranian students condemned to death for taking part in the demonstrations last July
These sentences come in addition to the equally ignominious sentences of 13 Iranian Jews , not to mention here the thousands of victims of repression in the past
All those under threat of capital punishment for political reasons should be released immediately , as should the great numbers of students sentenced to imprisonment
of trusts such as Shell , for example , which has just signed a USD 800 million contract with the Iranian Government
ceremony , so that other trusts could sign other just as fat contracts
is not yet over , and it is his release that we have to achieve
Respect for Serbs and other minority groups in Kosovo
Mr President , what has happened in recent years in Kosovo is a profound tragedy
On many occasions , we have condemned from this Chamber the outrages perpetrated upon the Kosovan Albanian people
Their suffering is inconceivable , and none of us can ever understand the scale of what they have experienced
We in the European Union are also guilty of not having succeeded in time in preventing Milosevic' s insane excursions so close to our own territory
The EU also has an important role to play in the reconstruction process
All democratic forces must be supported in order to facilitate the reconstruction and create a functioning and democratic civil society
Serbian minority , but also other minorities
If any kind of normality is to be achieved , all affected parties must feel secure in returning or in staying where they are
This applies to both the majority and the minority
The persecutions , and in certain cases murders , of Serbs which have occurred are therefore entirely to be condemned and must cease
They do not carry the peace process forward
to condemn these
to peace
I plead for all parties and organisations to work together for a better and brighter future in Kosovo , a future where all can hopefully live together
on the part of the Albanians , which , furthermore , is of an even higher proportion
yardsticks; and thirdly , the impression would be given that the objective of the intervention was to destroy the Serbian people
the result that we expected
Have the murders , expulsions , looting and pillaging in Kosovo stopped
Unfortunately not
Unfortunately the crimes are continuing , with two differences
First: the victims of the crimes are no longer the Kosovo Albanians , but Serbs , Roma and even Bosnians
would have wanted to protect
Who is to blame
Unfortunately those for whom the international community waged a war , the first war on humanitarian grounds
therefore has the right to commit exactly the same crimes as those who led to this war
And that is the disgrace
The international community has until now just looked on at what is happening
actually - if not other Kosovans - other UN officials could complete this work and the various different tasks that need to be performed in Kosovo
Mr President , Mr Sakellariou , I can immediately endorse what you have said
I was there in October
I can confirm that the military power could not resolve the problems on the spot
On the contrary , the old principle is being borne out: violence breeds violence
The international community in fact has no solution to the Kosovo conflict that exists just as it did before
The conflict is there as it was previously
The international community does say that Kosovo is part of the rest of Yugoslavia and we are creating a multi-ethnic society
But the reality in Kosovo is completely different
Everyone who is there and everyone who works there knows that , and that includes the EU officials
The former KLA , Mr Sakellariou , I can stress , feels that it is the victor and , through the mainly economic international aid , feels that this victory is confirmed
All the parties theoretically declare that the Serbs , Roma and Albanians can live together but in practice the situation in Pristina is different
You can no longer see the Cyrillic alphabet
It has all been destroyed , because the Slav language may no longer be spoken
For all Serbs who live in Pristina this means that they can really no longer take part in public life
This is Pristina , a city full of international organisations
In M√≠trovica the situation is much worse
The city is completely divided and is becoming more markedly so day by day
Why is that
aid in the social field
There is no money available for these things on the spot
Mr Kouchner knows that reconstruction in Kosovo will fail on the very matter of the protection of the minorities
He is not receiving any help from the EU in that regard
discredits us all
In many cases in which I have tried to help since 1989 , I have felt myself to be personally compromised
Why did we intervene as an international community
We decided to help the Albanians because their basic and human rights were being infringed
For that reason we went in and I still believe that it was the right thing to do
to the Bosnians
But they have suffered dreadfully and we must not forget that
The mass graves , more of which are found every day , are proof of this
I therefore believe that it will be very difficult for them to live together
Wounds heal extremely slowly
We in Central and Northern Europe know that too
I therefore believe that we must demand something , that they can contribute and that is , coexistence on the ground
And we must help them
These criminal acts must also be denounced by the Albanian leaders
We must help with the means at our disposal to find the perpetrators and convict them
We want to prevent injustice and now some of those we have helped are turning out to be liars and are themselves driving out minorities
The Roma , Serbs , Croats and Bosnians , anyone in fact who might not speak this language , belongs to this group
I should not like the oppressed people to become oppressors themselves
ensures that such criminal acts do not occur again
they themselves are taking responsibility
their homeland , and so we must also appeal to them
I believe that we need an interim government - and more quickly than Mr Kouchner is able to establish one
the international community so that we have a contact to talk to
Everywhere , where things are going well in the communities , we must react positively and say that we are helping you more than we help those who do nothing
paper than in reality
But I am not of the opinion that we can do all of that merely by installing democracy
finally hold tools in their hands and do something for their country
in carrying out his task
Mr President , today' s debate has until now unfortunately been really one-sided as we have forgotten to be self-critical
We have for years ignored the oppression that went on for 10 years in Kosovo
Doris Pack and others did not do so , but a large majority did
his non-violence
difference with the current isolated acts of revenge that are of course despicable - Rugova lost control of the forces
all failed in this way
Of course we must send out a strong signal against any expulsions
I myself come from a family who - collectively innocent - on the basis of state decrees 50 years ago , were expelled
Any expulsion is an expulsion too many and this 20th century is likely to go down in history as the century of genocide and expulsions
right to a homeland become the foundations of international law , so that such dreadful events are not repeated
create a multi-ethnic Kosovo , which was our goal , and of creating a ethnically pure Kosovo , i
e
a purely Albanian Kosovo just before we reach that goal
Mr Posselt , you are right in your criticism
contribute to Rugova being frozen out
fairly well
But where the ethnic groups meet , the conflicts are very acute and they have become more acute
have been before they got to hospital
The language of the international community must be clear here
of the Serbs , the Roma , the Sinti and other ethnic groups being accepted in his country
future structure , but are working in a one-sided way according to which side they are on
in history and he will tell you a lot about it
If you ask him how the social security system of the future will be extended , you will not find anyone who can give you an answer"
So it is all the more important - and I should like to stress this - that UNMIK and Bernard Kouchner make rapid progress in setting up a government
The government must of course have contact with the population
It must work together with the population
with its mandate and its authority and of course the European Union as well
We must help the Albanian population to build a multi-ethnic society
That is the great task before us
The battle for freedom in Kosovo has not yet been won
There is still a lot to do
It is most gratifying to note that all the Groups in this House are clearly in agreement on this subject
That is certainly a great help
Mr President , it is with great sadness that the Union for a Europe of Nations Group will be voting in favour of the joint motion for resolution
and even cowardice
parties involved in the conflict , we would inevitably be provoking the endless outbursts of violence which we are witnessing today
they had their headquarters in Frankfurt for years , we endorsed the reign of terror
not just the more or less compassionate witnesses to a new bout of ethnic cleansing
We Europeans , and the Kouchner mission in particular , are accomplices , not to mention , in the final analysis , the instigators
Hypocrisy is compounded by blindness , for we have effectively confused the concepts of nationhood and ethnicity , the national principle and the ethnic principle
A nation , need one remind you , is the opposite of an ethnic grouping
to keep repeating it
domain , in favour of a political structure , which for two centuries , and perhaps even for much more than two centuries , we in France have called the Republic
we will end up with nothing but the eruption of ethnic groups everywhere , not to say , gangs , with accounts being settled and , ultimately , war in Europe
Thus , by destroying nations , its own foundation , its own basic principle , its essential strength , Europe today is in the process of destroying itself
Blindness , in turn , is compounded by cowardice
does not suffer any competition anywhere on the planet and which has undertaken to divide Europe in order to rule as master everywhere
This is one of the goals of the United States in this matter , and we have gone along with it out of weakness and cowardice
war
Mr President , Hashim Tha√ßi , the leader of the KLA (the Kosovo Liberation Army) , recently postulated: "I am the President of Kosovo
People who support my government are welcome in Kosovo
Anyone who creates hassle should leave
"
This misplaced display of power , deserving of condemnation to say the least , follows in the footsteps of the execrable oppression regime adopted by Slobodan Milosevic
This political line is just as diametrically opposed to pacification , let alone a social renewal process , within the legendary battlefield of Kosovo Polje and its surrounding areas
In fact , Tha√ßi' s words are inviting the remaining members of the Serbian minority to leave if they have not done so already
Words which have been reinforced in the past couple of months by downright acts of terror , committed by the victims of yesterday , by Albanian Kosovars
Significantly , Albanian journalist Veton Surroi sharply condemned this reprehensible attitude as being "organised and systematic terror which can only be described as fascist"
The minority Roma group too suffered badly under a pogrom-like Albanian attitude
I would like to make a special appeal for the Kosovar Roma , one of the oldest communities there
Today , it is collectively paying the price for being a so-called accomplice in the Milosevic regime
After all , Belgrade gave Kosovar Roma the jobs which it no longer gave to the Kosovar Albanians between 1989-1999
Mr President , thorough , unbiased historical investigation should show to what extent the Albanian allegations of atrocities carried out by Kosovar Roma in respect of their Albanian fellow citizens are true
One thing is for sure , from both a Christian and general , moral perspective: crimes do not under any circumstance justify new crimes
Well now , those have definitely taken place since the arrival of the UN and KFOR in Kosovo on 12 June
What is more , they were already occurring in the Macedonian refugee camps
The outcome was obvious: an estimated 20 ,000 Roma fled from Kosovo , most of whom ended up in refugee camps in neighbouring Montenegro and Macedonia
However , according to my sources , these camps will be closing by the end of the year
If this information is correct , what does the EU intend to do to help these displaced Kosovar Roma
In this context , I would also like to raise another pressing question
In Montenegro , large numbers of Kosovar Roma are falling into the hands of unscrupulous people smuggling refugees into Italy
What can the European Union , in close cooperation with the Montenegro authorities , do to stop this
Finally , it was recently stated in a report in the Chechen weekly "Tyden" on "the covert Roma exodus" from Kosovo that Roma do not give much thought to their future
Why should they
within the central Balkans"
All the more reason why the international community should now join forces to protect the Roma who are still in Kosovo
Alexander Nikitin
Mr President , on 23 November , Alexander Nikitin will appear in court again
He still has to face trial on an old case of "spying"
It became clear a long time ago that he has the information in the Bellona report from sources that are accessible to the general public
However , his expert knowledge made it possible for us to be made aware of an enormous hazard that is heading for us and is slumbering in the Arctic Ocean
He acted with a great sense of humanity
The EU has a special responsibility here because until now it has used the material that Alexander Nikitin compiled
affect us all
are purely political and therefore the laws in Russia will also be infringed by these proceedings , because the old nomenclature will win again
I believe that Alexander Nikitin has acted with enormous consideration for others and with remarkable responsibility in making this material available to us
a political case and Alexander Nikitin can finally be released
Alexander Nikitin should be free and honoured
Strasbourg
On the other side of the river is the European Court of Human Rights , to which Mr Nikitin has appealed
whose heart are the fifteen Member States of the EU
We therefore have an important duty to speak up for Mr Nikitin and his release so that he can finally live in humane and constitutional conditions
constitutional treatment
It would be a disgrace if we gave way , because - as Mrs Schroedter put it so well - Mr Nikitin also acted in our interests
We have often dealt with it here in the Parliament
He acted on behalf of the European environment
He acted for the rule of law on the whole continent
We should in fact award Mr Nikitin one of our prizes here in the European Parliament
I should therefore like to endorse this motion for a resolution most emphatically and the appeal it contains
Mr President , I rise on behalf of my group but also on behalf of my colleague Lord Bethell , who takes a particular concern and interest in this matter
The fate of Alexander Nikitin is particularly relevant to a topical and urgent debate
Next Tuesday he is due to appear in court in Russia
I believe this is the sixth time that he will appear in court
He is indicted on a charge of high treason , which is a very strong and extreme charge and for what
For addressing a matter of public interest , of environmental interest to the whole of Europe
Under this charge he faces a possible death sentence
be dropped and it should respect our call for his immediate release
of Europe , as to whether he should be indicted and what the sanction should be
So I very much support the calls for Mr Nikitin to be immediately released and found not guilty of the charges
I shall answer briefly the three points which have been raised: capital punishment , the minorities in Kosovo and the Nikitin case
resolution and which , plainly , meets with the approval of the Commission as far as the position adopted on capital punishment is concerned
This does not , I feel , merit extensive comment , as we are in agreement on this point
What I wish to bring up is a specific point which was mentioned in the course of the discussion , i
e
the matter of the draft resolution on capital punishment which the Union proposed to the Third Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations
This is , in fact , a matter of foreign policy
By means of this resolution , the European Union was proposing to the international community that it undertake to establish a moratorium on capital punishment
matter of criminal law , or so they claim , at least
We did indeed withdraw this draft resolution , on mature reflection , and this decision is presented for your evaluation
We withdrew it because the debates in this Third Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations were , in our opinion , going badly
the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state
" This amendment was indeed inconvenient , insofar as it shifted the debate into another sphere , that of the national jurisdiction of a state
was a "legitimate concern" of the international community
Moreover , accepting an amendment of this kind could have had a very negative impact on the work of the United Nations in the human rights field
for the time being , but rather in order to maintain a position of principle
the risk , considering the proposed amendments , of finding ourselves , for the sake of the legitimate campaign we share , some way behind the positions we have gained earlier
This is the explanation I wished to give you
I shall now come to the second subject , Mr President , regarding the rights of the Serbs and other minorities in Kosovo
who is inflicting and who is suffering it
Such violence is just as unacceptable today against the Serbian and Gypsy minorities as it was when it was inflicted upon the Kosovars several months before
communities
made that we must all meticulously take stock of the situation
From now on , in the new circumstances , we are nonetheless trying pragmatically to continue to act according to these objectives , particular in selecting aid and assistance projects
We support fully and absolutely the action undertaken by KFOR to maintain law and order in Kosovo and to protect all the citizens
are currently handled by KFOR , and to create a peaceful multi-ethnic society , capable of taking on both the reconstruction of Kosovo and the restoration of its society
programme we suggested in response to this request
We are also offering our support , in the form of twinning , to the actions agreed by MINUK at local administration level
and KFOR achieve them themselves
I may remind you , if you need reminding , that we are opposed to Kosovo being partitioned
It must become a multi-ethnic society , without distinctions or discrimination for ethnic or other reasons
a great degree of concern Alexander Nikitin's trial
to send back the case to the lower court for further investigation
in full conformity with internationally agreed principles and standards of justice and human rights
this application accordingly
principles of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Russian Constitution
Thank you very much , Commissioner Lamy

Rwanda/Burundi
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0267/99 by Mrs Ries and Mr van den Bos , on behalf of the ELDR Group;

B5-0301/99 by Mr Van Hecke and Mr Khanbhai , on behalf of the PPE (Christian Democrats)/DE Group;
on the situation in the Great Lakes region and in particular on Rwanda and the situation in Burundi
Mr President , Commissioner , the recent release of Jean Bosco Barayagwiza by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda has scandalised the government and population in Rwanda
Their anger is perfectly legitimate: the defendant was released on a technicality despite the extremely serious charges against him , charges of genocide
Going beyond this particular episode which the Rwandans see as traumatic , what is involved here is the culture of impunity
It must be clearly established that all those who committed crimes as heinous as genocide or crimes against humanity , or who were accomplices to these , will be pursued tirelessly
In order to do so , international institutions , and that includes ourselves , must provide the international courts with sufficient resources to accomplish its task
opinion of the populations who are waiting for truth and justice
far off , is maintained , it is the role of the European Union , I feel , to stand by the people of Rwanda on this occasion
Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM)
to establish justice and , hence , peace
fulfil its ambitions
This is the price of what we owe to the memory of the Rwandans
worker and a number of civilians from south-east Burundi had been murdered
We asked for an inquiry to take place following a general resolution; this was originally to be an independent inquiry
A Burundi representative , however , lodged objections and after that , we had to use the term "inquiry"
Burundian government , to give their opinion but we would also like to see the actual facts surface
We would appreciate it if the Commission could ensure that its EU ambassadors in the region could collate information on this matter and duly inform us
My second point concerns the fact that the conflict in question is far more extensive
Since 1993 , some 200 ,000 have been killed and 800 ,000 displaced
dimensions is still taking place in an area of Central Africa
awareness and energy of those who work there , so as to arrive at a stability pact
importance to them in relation to Kosovo , but also where this Central-African region is concerned
I hope that both resolutions go some way towards achieving this
Mr President , once again we are called upon to discuss the situation in Rwanda
Yesterday we were deploring genocide and violations of human rights
the incitement to genocide
of European countries , particularly France , where a recent parliamentary inquiry revealed complicity that was , at the best , passive
from this point of view
based on justice and the prosecution of those responsible for ethnic violence
This is why we are asking the ICTR to review its position regarding Mr Barayagwiza' s release , in consideration of the seriousness of the charges against him
vigour
We also ask the Rwandan government to resume its relations with the ICTR
This is why it is essential to put an end to the conditions of impunity which are prevailing in these countries
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to subscribe to what the previous speakers have said and at the same time express my indignation at and disappointment with our own attitude
We wait until a white person is murdered before we take renewed interest in a conflict in Burundi that has taken so many thousands of people into their graves
I would also like to mention the camps which , in Dutch , we refer to as "hergroepingskampen" (regrouping camps)
This term stands for concentration camps , this is what they really are
In these camps , they section people off based on their ethnic origin so as to facilitate covert genocide
I would therefore urge that the European Union take the situation in Rwanda , Burundi and Congo a great deal more seriously
stage , to help create for others the stability that we want for ourselves
the main African language of the Great Lakes region , I speak on this subject with experience and knowledge
Genocide in any country is evil and must be condemned without reservation
Whoever is responsible for such genocide must be indicted , and justice must be seen to be done
There cannot be any immunity for anyone from such prosecution
and speedy end
Only four trials have been completed in five years , and this delay has allowed some perpetrators of genocide to go free on technicalities
This is not acceptable
and resources
homes
This resolution , agreed by all political groups in this Parliament , expresses clearly our concerns , hopes and expectations
It is now up to the government of Rwanda and those of neighbouring countries to take serious action to bring about genuine peace in the area
peace and stability in Rwanda and the Great Lakes region in general
Mr President , Burundi , as has been stated earlier , is on the brink of another catastrophe
Rebel attacks , army cleansing , hundreds of thousands of refugees falling prey to starvation and disease and an economy which is ruined beyond repair
Some even claim that the situation is comparable to that in Rwanda just before the genocide in 1994
Despite this , Europe is adopting a back-seat approach again
in the crisis
from the same country
We refuse to cooperate for fundamental reasons with a government that has managed nonetheless to acquire Parliament' s support
The question is very much whether , in this way , we are not playing into the hands of the extremists , both amongst the rebels and within the army
Do we want Hutu extremist movements to seize power in Burundi and commit renewed genocide on a minority
Or are we waiting for a new coup and Tutsi extremists from the army to start renewed cleansing
If we do not want this , let us then give our full support to the peace process in Burundi
Let us bring the moderate parties round the table and isolate the extremists
Let us give unconditional aid to the population and kick-start the economy
Let us finally take Burundi' s problem seriously
In any case , we will never be able to say: we did not know
took place on 6 November , i
e
a few days ago , when the Rwanda government announced that it would refuse further cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal in Arusha
- in order to clear up these inhuman crimes and to punish the respective perpetrators
As an initial reaction , this attitude of the Rwandan government is even understandable , but the conclusion that it drew from it , i
e
now to refuse further cooperation with this Tribunal , is entirely the wrong one
hard to swallow - was released and not brought before the court at all
for the slaughter of 800 000 people
racial hatred
Our Group has a two-fold demand: on the one hand to the Rwanda government , to cancel its decision and on the other hand to the Tribunal to revise this decision
In particular , it is not acceptable that the Tribunal refer to the fact that a further charge in the same case is inadmissible owing to the "not guilty" verdict
For charges of this kind there can be no immunity
Mr President , I shall take the statements that I must answer in order , first on the subject of Rwanda , then Burundi
to judge those responsible for genocide
No national reconciliation is possible without proper court procedures , and that involves both the Rwandan national justice system and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda
of respect for human rights
Nonetheless , there are still 130 ,000 prisoners in prison , accused of crimes related to genocide , awaiting trial
The Rwandan Government is looking for alternative formulae which do not leave room for impunity , and which go in the direction we would like
on this task
With the other backers , the Commission is currently assessing the opportunities and methods to contribute to the establishment of this system within the framework of our cooperation
As far as the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda is concerned , the Commission allocated finance from the very creation of this tribunal , totalling EUR 1
5 million to date
The Commission is going to initiate an evaluation of human rights programmes in developing countries
Particular attention will be paid to the countries or projects we have supported , such as the one I have just mentioned
the light of this investigation
As far as Burundi is concerned , we , too , are extremely concerned at the situation of increasing violence in this country
What are we doing in response to this
I know and I can see that it is always ridiculous to cite aid figures in the face of such calamities
I nonetheless believe that these are the only real proof we can offer to show what we are doing to act on these concerns of yours
The real criticism you might make , which would hit home , is that we are passive in this type of situation
I believe we are not being passive in this particular instance
I should like to give you some examples of this
which should , along with other external finance , be sufficient for the successful conclusion of these talks
It is true that the passing of the facilitator , ex-President Nyerere , is one more obstacle to add to the complexity of the process itself
We think that it is essential for the talks to continue while seeking a new facilitator at the same time
this debate , been forcibly detained in camps by the government since last July
meet the most urgent needs next year
The total ECHO contribution to Burundi reached around EUR 10 million this year
of the population and to target their support at the rehousing of displaced persons
In the context of these positions , the Commission approved a redevelopment programme of around EUR 50 million , which may be implemented according to the security conditions in the country
lead , finally , to democratisation
This is the answer which I wished to give you , Mr President
Thank you very much , Commissioner Lamy

The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution:
B5-0269/99 by Mr Van den Bos and Mrs Thors , on behalf of the ELDR Group;
B5-0277/99 by Mr Vinci and Mr Brie , on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;
B5-0278/99 by Mr Thomas Mann , on behalf of the PPE (Christian Democrats)/DE Group;

B5-0296/99 by Mrs Lambert and Mrs Lucas , on behalf of the Greens/ALE Group
on the declaration of a state of emergency in Pakistan
This resolution sets out the concerns that must be shared by the world-wide community about the deterioration of stability in Pakistan and in its neighbouring territories
We are certainly right to regret the military take-over but it would be sensible to recognise that the new military regime is so far extremely popular within Pakistan
Pakistan clearly expects General Musharraf to succeed in stopping a long series of corrupt and illiberal factions
The Sharif and Bhutto regimes have misruled their country for many years
Certainly the military are tackling the financial fraud that exists on a massive scale with vigour
This motion speaks wrongly of the need for democracy to be reinstalled or reinstated
It should be a calling for progress towards democracy and proposing a practical programme for the European Union that will facilitate that progress
Fighting corruption is an essential first step

The national banks must stop the custom of awarding generous loans to officials
The new , stricter anti-corruption legislation is a step in the right direction
The loss of confidence and flight of capital can only be stopped if democracy is restored and human rights are guaranteed
International investment has been suspended until the IMF accepts Pakistan as a full partner
We therefore demand that the military government return to constitutional rule
Politics must be taken over by a democratic legitimate civil government

Mr President , our colleagues have already spoken about the military coup
I should once again like to emphasise what Mr Duff and Mr Mann have said
that is out of control to be part of daily life in Pakistan and all this has led to the ruin of the country
terrorist activity in the border region of Kashmir against their Indian neighbours
Despite everything , we should not allow ourselves to consider the military coup as a possible alternative to the incompetence and corruption of an elected government
transitional government in accordance with a clear timetable to restore parliamentary legitimacy by holding elections
These should be the preconditions to be fulfilled before the Council signs the suspended Cooperation Agreement with Pakistan
that any future would-be dictator must prevent such dreadful behaviour
and concerned about good democratic practice
They were not appalled
and the increasing abuse of the blasphemy law which was introduced after the military take-over in 1958
Under the previous regime we also saw a growing abuse of human rights , of people such as the Sindhi
We look at what will be happening to political prisoners under this regime as a clear indicator of its intentions
I am also concerned at reports that the military were motivated by the feeling that the Sharif government was not doing enough to protect and maintain the Federation of Pakistan
I find that particularly worrying when I remember its developing nuclear capability
rather not to return but to introduce good democratic government to Pakistan
Mr President , as regards Pakistan , as you know , the situation was discussed in the General Affairs Council on 15 November

The commitments for Community projects currently amount to some EUR 180 million in total and the Commission proposes to continue to implement these projects
We feel that suspending aid to underprivileged groups would be an inappropriate sanction upon them

We are also participating in a project with the International Labour Organisation for the rehabilitation of children employed in dangerous work in Pakistan

for absorption and the size of the many NGOs in this field in Pakistan are , unfortunately , limited

We shall now proceed to the vote on topical and urgent subjects of major importance
Vote (continuation)
here , that is , the systematic abuse of resolutions for an ideological debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights
half measures in resolutions
of the family and the parents' right to educate their children in the family
These are elementary points that must be discussed in depth and not superficially and at top speed
to this legislation
This vote has nothing to do with any others in which I have participated during this session
human beings
This may seem presumptuous , given the scope of the task , but it is my profound conviction
this Parliament to make progress
of course be put into effect in our policies and our daily life
Let us act like responsible men and women (politicians)
The Convention whose anniversary we are celebrating today has made it possible to achieve considerable progress since it places the child at the centre of the debate
Children are human beings; they are people with rights
We must respect them , protect them , educate them and love them
The Convention on the Rights of the Child represents the most successful Convention in international law , with signatories in all countries of the world except Somalia and the USA
the world's citizens
The draft resolution which we have voted today seeks to ensure that the elements enshrined within this convention are protected in other legal bases and frameworks
In doing this , we are seeking to be a voice for the voiceless , and protect those who are unable to protect themselves
Children must be protected by those who have their interests at heart
We must emphasise , therefore , the role of the family in safeguarding children , especially parents
and safeguarding their children
its responsibilities within the community'
Promoting the rights of children is a topic dear to the hearts of all of us here today
It is at the same time a great privilege and a grave responsibility to work to create legislation and legal instruments for the protection of children
Ensuring the protection of children must go hand in hand with measures which promote and protect the family
A strong family unit is essential to ensuring the protection of children
environment'
Articles 5 , 7 , 9 , 14 , and others enshrine the responsibilities and rights of parents in relation to the raising of their children
It is absolutely crucial that parental rights are enshrined and ensured in order to protect the full rights of children
I welcome the focus in the House today on the rights of children
Children , as the most vulnerable and defenceless members of society need extra rights and extra protection
It is a privilege for me to be part of a process that can begin to ensure that this protection is provided
The family , as was recognised by the drafters of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , is fundamental in protecting and promoting the rights of the child
society throughout their lives
receive this care , guidance , and love
the rights of children to that protection and support
Chechnya
army in an abusive manner against the small country of Chechnya
Russia is causing destruction , and the death of civilians - including old people , women and children - as well as an exodus which exceeds that of Kosovo
endangering democracy , the Rule of Law and the economic reforms of the Russian Federation
We cannot accept it and therefore we condemn it outright
too , we contributed decisively to a peace agreement being signed
ice in the context of this war , will not be adopted by the House
that the bombing of the civilian population can finally cease and for it to be declared an internal problem
so that it actually affects them and is not just something here on paper
It is a matter of great concern that I should like to make quite clear once again on behalf of my Group
For us the resolution does not go far enough , but it is a first step - hopefully to a peaceful solution in the region
- (FR) On the pretext of attacking fundamentalist terrorism , the leaders of Russia are conducting a despicable war in Chechnya
in inhuman conditions
Once again it is the civilian population which is suffering from the consequences of the destruction of towns , villages and infrastructure of a country which is already very poor
The war is also a criminal one as regards the Russian people itself
Thousands of young men are forced to wage this dirty war which can have no positive outcome for either themselves or for their parents and elders
the population , considerable sums of money are being swallowed up by the war effort , not to mention the cost of the corruption associated with it
Yeltsin and his clan , anxious as they are to protect them
In bombing the towns and villages of Chechnya , the Russian army is doing what the Western armies did a few months ago in bombing Kosovo and Serbia
Two wrongs do not make a right , but these crimes do shed light on the deep complicity of the governments , to the detriment of the peoples concerned
This is the explanation for our abstention
That concludes the vote
EU action plan to combat drugs (continuation)
on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on a European Union Action Plan to Combat Drugs (2000-2004) (COM(1999)239)
on Eurodac and thereby to create the conditions under which we can introduce this fingerprint checking
This is a very important report
I should first like to quote some figures so that you have an idea of the scale of the drug trade
people and our families
Within the European Union we annually seize some 600 tonnes of cannabis
cannabis
The legal position in Europe is extremely unsatisfactory
In the eyes of the citizens of Europe the battle against drug crime should be treated as an absolute priority
I therefore believe that Marietta Giannakou' s report is especially important and the action plan is something really fundamental that can help us in this field
It contains broad strategies , from prevention to repression to reintegration
It does not allow for any liberalisation or legalisation and sets priorities and brings domestic and foreign policy together in order to be able to combat drugs successfully
model
Prevention has little support and the youth programmes are not designed for support in combating drugs
The European Union makes relatively little money available
So what are the feasible and absolutely essential demands that we must make
The first thing for me is that it is vital for the prevention policy to be intensified
through education that a life without drugs should be their main goal
We therefore need the support of the European Union programmes such as SOCRATES and LEONARDO
protect young people
We must make the European Union programmes such as FALQONE , GROTIUS or OISIN more productive , organise them more efficiently and make more funds available
So with the action plan we have a good programme
as a whole
That must be the aim , even if it is very difficult to achieve
of the long Napolitano , Leinen , Dimitrakopoulos and Schwaiger reports , we will be voting on Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou' s report tomorrow morning
Friday morning in Strasbourg is the day when there is the most pressure
Tomorrow the plenary sitting will be bursting with Members crowding in to vote on the Giannakou report
If there are fifty , that will be a lot
be discussed and voted on this week
There is no logic behind that
drugs policy in the European Union is one of the most controversial subjects that we have ever had to discuss
I would first of all address a comment to the rapporteur
by national traditions , by different factors and by partially conflicting interests
So our Group wishes to thank the rapporteur most warmly
receive broad approval
conclusive report by the Parliament emerges on this action plan
The words "logical" and "conclusive" really mean that three essential aspects have to be taken into consideration
premise: drug addicts do not on principle need punishment and persecution but help and support
That is really self-evident
Why do I have to mention that again here
and national experiences
the focus here , on the basis of the specific experiences of the local and regional authorities
the drug trade
must be pursued regardless
For this we need criminal law and the police
But we also need a factor that I feel has not been touched on adequately in the debate
Those people who deal in drugs generally do so if it is on a large scale , intending to make a profit and to enrich themselves
drug trade and money laundering are phenomena that are linked
the drug dealer , particularly in the area of money laundering
This is the third and final aspect , with which I will conclude
We all have different experiences
In one country in the European Union there is a rather permissive approach , in another a rather restrictive one
Overall if we consider the results of the Drug Monitoring Centre in Lisbon - almost everywhere there is an equally high drugs rate
This means that whatever the approach we adopt at present we are equally successful or unsuccessful
This means that we should set the parameters at a European scale and that implementation should be subsidiary and based on the respective national experiences
Mr President , it has to be said , the European Parliament has been divided over the drugs policy for years
By and large , there are three shades of opinion discernible in this House
Firstly , the followers of the Swedish model which , apart from treating drug addicts , emphasises the control of narcotics
Secondly , there are the followers of the Dutch model , which tends more towards the treatment of drug addicts than control
hard drugs , such as heroin and ecstasy
national policy might be affected
that the various approaches which I have described above can grow towards each other
the drugs nuisance created by the "coffee shops" and on drugs tourism
These three trends are also represented in the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party
I am therefore pleased to say that most of my group colleagues can vote in favour of Mrs Giannakou' s report
We find it an interesting report which fortunately disregards the issue of legalising narcotics and looks at the measures to be taken by the European Union
On 6 November last , the President of the Commission , Mr Prodi , advocated stronger European cooperation in the field of drug control
He did this further to reports of Italian youngsters using ecstasy which largely originated from my country , the Netherlands
Mr Prodi' s remarks caused a huge commotion in the Netherlands
I personally agree with Mr Prodi
If the European Union is intent on dealing with transnational crime forcefully , then this should also include the control of drug trafficking
In fact , that is Europol' s first task
Ecstasy is a hard drug which is lethal , as recent events in Italy have shown
Those supporting the legalisation of soft drugs should also be open to European cooperation
Indeed , a Member State could not legalise drugs on its own , this could only be done at European level
Mr President , if there is one issue for which we should keep our heads cool and our wits about us then it must be the drugs policy
The present report drafted by Mrs Giannakou is not exactly a shining example of this clarity
The debate is not being conducted in a very level-headed way
There is too much bellicose rhetoric and frankly , too much hullabaloo
We have noticed that slowly but surely this House has made some prudent steps in the right direction when it comes to dealing with this complex issue
This is certainly evident if we compare the present debate and text with those of a couple of years ago
At that time , hellfire and damnation were not punishment enough for Members who dared mention the words harm reduction or a therapeutic approach
To most people in this House , it was completely inconceivable that , apart from a repressive approach to the drugs policy , other , more effective strategies could also be developed
The Giannakou report represents a clear improvement on a number of points
It recognises the importance of urban and regional policy experiments , refers to harm reduction and is prepared to evaluate different pluralistic therapeutic approaches
Not very revolutionary and only a small step forward
likelihood in an integrated European Union
The way in which these positive elements are formulated , however , leaves too much scope for opposing interpretations
Positive developments evident from the text cannot compete with the repressive mood which is still prevailing
Think , for example , of the enforced rehabilitation of drug addicts in prisons
This leads to inhumane situations and is not very effective if not taken on board out of one' s own free will
The objective of the aid policy should not be restricted to achieving total abstinence in the long run
One can live with drugs , as is the case - to many people' s delight - with alcohol and tobacco and as is the case with Prozac and Valium
Does the rapporteur' s ferocious war declaration apply here too
After all , research has shown that a good joint is less harmful and addictive than some socially accepted drugs
with very promising results
The rapporteur is of the opinion that a fatalistic outlook encourages drug abuse
This is a fallacy intended to sharpen the senseless war against drug abuse
It exacerbates marginalisation and crime and will lead to more crime
It is a repressive instrument which , unlike the addict , profits from this approach
Mr President , when I was 18 years old , there were no problems with drugs
We had of course heard that there were such things as drugs , but they were substances we were unfamiliar with and had never encountered
It was said however that some people got their doctors to supply them with substances they would otherwise not have had access to
Nor did we have open borders
I am sure , have been able to buy them
The main point , however , was that we did not see any need for them
Today , the world looks rather different
It is open , and the Schengen Agreement has opened the borders between our countries to such a degree that we do not have much opportunity to exercise supervision
far overtaken the constitutional states' ability to stop the drugs traffic
cross-border crime
step up the war against the drug barons and financiers and their money laundering , then the constitutional states , our populations and our youth will lose out in this war
But the report also contains forms of words which were voted through by the Committee and which must look perfectly harmless , especially to those unfamiliar with these matters
They are concepts like harm reduction
And who would not want to reduce harm; who would not want to help people overtaken by a form of suffering as serious as drug dependency
medical provisions
But that is not what in fact lies behind the concept
Harm reduction means something quite different in the mouths of those who do not want to see a strict drugs policy pursued
May I say that I am completely at a loss to understand that philosophy , for drug abuse is not nowadays an isolated problem , affecting only the socially needy
today are victims of drug abuse
an extra lift or trip on Saturday at the discotheque and to have their mood raised with the help of a drug they are lured into believing is harmless
In this connection , I cannot refrain from saying that I think that the speech which Mrs Buitenweg made here a moment ago is dangerous
case with alcohol and tobacco"
I am well aware that you can become dependent upon tobacco
It also takes a relatively large number of years before you get lung cancer from it
I am well aware that you can become dependent upon alcohol , and I also know that there are people who lose their lives through alcohol abuse
of these substances to a different degree than young people who have got mixed up in drug abuse are able to control their use of drugs
as being harmless and as things no worse to take than an extra glass of beer or an extra little whisky
It is in fact something different we are talking about here , and it has not become dangerous because it is forbidden; rather , it is forbidden because it is dangerous
young people and destroy their health
has done in this connection
hope that the Commissioner will be able to find still more effective and more powerful methods of combating this alarming misuse of drugs
drugs
The European Commission does the same in its plan of action
It has opted for a two-pronged approach: to control and prevent the demand for drugs and call for a hard-line approach regarding the supply of drugs
Over the past couple of months , the drugs issue has been in the limelight rather a great deal
The Tampere Summit underlined once more that the problem in Europe should be approached in a comprehensive manner
The President of the Commission , Mr Prodi , indicated last week that an "internal market for the trade in drugs" has come about in the Union
the trade
Given the many irritated Dutch reactions , this remark really hit home
Unfortunately , however , Mr Prodi denied that he was talking about the Netherlands
synthetic drugs
Several young people have since died of the effects of these synthetic drugs
This is really scandalous
its diverging policy
I can certainly see the benefits of the Dutch policy
For example , the care for addicts is excellent
On the demand side , many sound initiatives have been developed
But this serves little purpose if we continue to be blinkered regarding the supply side
It is about time that the Netherlands draws up a balance sheet; at international and European level , the Dutch policy does not fit in and creates problems
So time then for a change of course
It so happens that cooperation at European level is aimed at constructive confrontation
For this purpose , the plan of action is offering some useful instruments
Let us undertake this challenge as a matter of priority
been sufficiently assessed
It is therefore impossible to determine to what extent the objectives laid down have been met
Parliament' s agenda
Therefore , illogically , you are preparing to reconfirm the previous plan' s strategies for the next five years
enough to put forward alternative strategies
issue and tries to resolve it , and , if the solution does not provide positive results or is counterproductive , as in this case , adopts a different policy
a matter for each individual' s conscience
justify things with the lack of financial resources
But how much would it cost to eliminate drug trafficking , a trade that the United Nations says accounts for 8% of world trade
certain substances to a criminal monopoly
None of this surprises me: during this century crazy and incomprehensible things such as Nazism , Fascism and Communism have managed to gain power
Prohibition of drugs still remains: ethical , inhuman and anti-scientific madness
Mr President , the European Parliament is now establishing a policy , that is to say a drugs policy , which has emerged in fits and starts over a period of many years
It is a firm drugs policy
worked with these questions in previous years
to be a firm drugs policy
In fact , we Swedes have a fairly definite view of these questions
I think we can now count upon seeing good results in the field of drugs policy
I am particularly pleased that it is the Group of the European People' s Party' s drugs programme which in fact forms the basis of the present compromise
and towards the long-term goal of a society without drugs
respective policies
It is therefore important that it should be precisely that policy which is the best policy which should stand as an example
I should therefore like to urge the Commission to ensure in particular that the new Member States also have the opportunity to be present when the project is devised
In my own country , many people , it is true , feel rather discriminated against in this area
If we are bad at carrying out projects , we should like to improve
go down
It is also important that we should comply with the laws of the different countries
We cannot , in this European Union , step into some kind of grey area of a community governed by law and not comply with our legislation
a State governed by law
I should like to thank you for the efforts which have been made and urge us all to be very much more committed in the future
We are not there yet by any means
Rather , there is a very great deal of work which remains to be done
Unfortunately , many of the amendments on the table here in this Chamber place obstacles in the way , so I hope that many of them will be rejected
Fridays and their future
Unlike my colleagues from the Netherlands , Mr Wiebenga and Mr Blokland , I am proud of the Dutch policy
also a policy which , fortunately , is attracting more and more followers elsewhere in Europe
What is the logic behind it
The rationale
One may well wonder following this discussion
on this , that is tomorrow morning at 9
00 a
m
What is the issue
The Commission has made an announcement regarding a European Union plan of action concerning drug control for the years 2000 to 2004
Compared with a previous plan of action , this document is clearly a step forward
We are now on track for a kind of mainstreaming of the drugs policy with the emphasis on prevention , but hardly any guiding choices are being made
Instead of making choices , we have mainly looked at the fantasy image of what avenues would be open to us once the war against drugs is over
also the poor coca farmers in Latin America and also the poppy planters in Asia
future
Is it not about time we drew up a cost-benefit analysis of what we are doing , which is in fact at the insistence of the US war on drugs
Netherlands , for example
Luckily , further to the Commission' s communication , we are making some room for users and some more room for potential users , young people , by pointing out the harmful effects
All in all this still has very little bearing on reality
After all , the Commission has repeatedly highlighted that the plan of action in this respect is merely a supplement
a missed opportunity to me
Few issues so highlight the differences of cultural approach between Member States
I feel this report reflects a good consensus and I congratulate Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou on the work that she has done in putting it together
may be needed
Why
prohibition is not working
Our approach , which is based on controlling the supply of drugs , is using up massive resources
The police in Bristol in my constituency tell me that 85% of all crime is drug-related
This is destroying our inner cities , where drug dealers find a large market and sometimes even become role models for disenchanted young people
is less frowned upon than in others
But , more importantly , it is helping to fund other forms of criminal activity and strengthening international organised crime
We need at least to consider switching resources away from attacking the supply of drugs and towards attacking demand
Mr President , rapporteur , this drug programme primarily concerns people who are drug addicts and their families
They desperately need help
I therefore feel that it is very important to undertake an honest analysis of the results of the programme and to draw the necessary conclusions
The aims of this drug control programme are first and foremost to reduce the supply and demand
Neither of these aims has been achieved
at European level
The same applies to the reduction in the supply of drugs
For a long time only 10% of the drug trade has been caught by the police
These shattering results are hushed up
Instead , the drug programme before us just contains a copy of the previous programme with cosmetic changes
Fortunately the Commission is undertaking an evaluation
However , an external assessment would clearly be better on this sensitive subject
In any case , the appropriate action will have to be taken
Despite the lack of success of the programme , a large part of the financial resources in the context of the drug programme goes into combating drugs
For anything that is aimed at minimising the damage , there is a very small amount left over
The question remains , however , why this programme is not clearly aiming to achieve the hidden goals
have been stated
What does this mean
The drug programme is used to increase the legitimacy of the EU
Drug programmes therefore have a purely instrumental character
And because that is at the expense of the addicts , we urgently need to think again
There is no ideal solution in drug policy , we all agree on that
But action must be taken
The urgent aim must be to minimise the damage and that must be firmly established in the drug programme
What that means in practice I shall show in four demands with which I shall now conclude
Firstly , supply should be reduced to the minimum
Secondly , methadone programmes should be expanded in the EU and the tried and tested controlled practice of the handing in of heroin should be introduced
Thirdly , drugs users should be able to test drugs for their content and mixture
Only in this way can further damage be prevented; we therefore need EU-wide drug checking
- drugs as belonging to society and lends support to people dealing responsibly with these drugs
We urgently need such a drug programme
Mr President , without alcohol , tobacco and drugs , we would live a healthier life and cause each other less nuisance
But a world without unhealthy stimulants is an unattainable utopia
to explore all that is risky and forbidden
Strict centralised European rules banning the use of drugs and regulating prosecution do not solve this problem
Small-scale projects for the support of addicts , including training , housing , employment and income and also the provision of information regarding the effects of drug abuse are much more important
I am somewhat alarmed at President Prodi' s recent announcement that small-scale , customised solutions will be prohibited in future
In the Netherlands , the use of soft drugs has been permitted for the past twenty years
This safeguards the users against sliding into crime and hard-drug addiction and offers the best chance of returning to a life without drugs
This important public-health measure has since been adopted in many towns and regions in other European states
It would be bad management to ban this policy , which can be held up as an example , in the name of European unification
contained in it
Mr President , Commissioner , I must confess that I am no fundamentalist where this matter is concerned and I respect those who hold different opinions
I particularly respect the opinion that has just been expressed by Mr Watson , whom I hold in great esteem
that drugs are an evil that must be fought
creates delinquency and makes society less safe , and which sustains world-wide criminal networks that defy States' power and law
We think that it is obvious that we have to wage an uncompromising war against drugs
This message is clearly made in Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou' s report and deserves our applause
Indeed , this is a problem of this day and age and is extremely worrying
measures now that monitoring , which is already difficult , is going to become even more difficult
We know that this is a growing problem
problems in terms of requests for treatment , drug-related deaths , HIV infection and social exclusion
drugs such as LSD and amphetamines
And all of this becomes more frightening if we consider that , at the moment , drug-related crime and the scale of drug trafficking represent around 8% of world trade
We agree that this problem must be tackled from three angles: by reducing demand , by controlling drug trafficking and by combating drug addiction
We agree that public awareness campaigns must be implemented and , at the same time , that we must strengthen prevention networks
designed to promote the reduction of risk , one example of which is the needle exchange programme
programmes for destroying crops , the destruction of laboratories and the prevention of trafficking
For this reason , the political will required by this report must become reality
If we limit ourselves to fine words , the conclusion will have to be that there has not been the political will
This can be measured by the efficiency of the actions and the public resources placed in the service of this fight
The report highlights the fact , and rightly so , that the budgetary resources are inadequate
example on an issue for which it has responsibility
The main European instrument in this struggle is the European Monitoring Centre in Lisbon
all , in terms of monitoring , identifying and proposals to ban dangerous substances placed on the market
This is why we proposed amendments to this report
They were , in essence , accepted and seek to strengthen the role of the Monitoring Centre and to provide it with the necessary financial means for its work
The other thing that our citizens are asking from us here is clarity
Giving fine speeches is not enough
dignity
Mr President , Commissioner , the Commission communication on the Union' s action plan to combat drugs is an important and positive communication
This plan covers all aspects of the problem and opens new prospects for a more mainstream , efficient approach
However , and this goes without saying , more resources are needed
improve the monitoring and evaluation of action intended mainly to reduce the supply of drugs
reduce both supply and demand , I would like to highlight the potential offered by Article 152 of the Treaty
This article allows the Union to complement national policies with action directed towards improving public health , preventing illness and reducing drugs-related damage to health
breaking the habit and restricting damage to the health of drug users
society and public health , so that Member States and applicant countries can use the conclusions as a guide when deciding their national policy
it will prove how efficient European and international collaboration has been in this difficult fight
which she has done
of civil society
creator of violence and has led to assassinations of the highest possible human cost to our country"
country of the world
between the different continents , whether they be the European Union , Latin America , South East Asia or African countries
The second concern is that the European Union must play a greater role in the field of reducing the demand for drugs
greater means and resources to fulfil its objective efficiently
and Melilla , which have become a channel for drug trafficking
I would like to dedicate the third consideration to the group which is most affected by this social scourge; our young people
A recent survey carried out in my country indicated that the second greatest social problem in the eyes of our young people was , after unemployment , the drug problem
As the resolution says , drugs give rise to family problems , work problems and road accidents
drug-taking , especially synthetic drugs , we can see the need to adopt urgent measures which will reverse this trend
this "pressure valve" from the lives of our young people which sometimes means that they are destroyed by something which starts out as a means of escape
But we cannot solve these problems by talk alone
Resources are required
and rehabilitation
And unfortunately this is still not the case
Mr President , congratulations to my colleague on her report
In my part of Europe 3 million people are on illegal drugs , that includes 28% of 16-29 year-olds and 14% of 14-15 year-olds
12 ,000 new , notified addict cases come each year; we have 70 ,000 drug offenders a year and we lose 1 ,200 people through drug-related deaths per year
This is a battle which we may not be winning now , but which we must not lose
and we need to encourage research
being committed to pay for people's habits
Many of the amendments to this report before us are therefore right
We need to educate young people
telling them the truth
The truth is that drugs can bring pleasure but also the truth is that they can damage health
Damage in the form of cancer and heart disease , in memory and concentration loss , testicular problems and so on , and young people need to understand that , too
Drug-taking is wrong , but we need to help those who are willing to accept help
family , his jobs , his prospects and his self-respect
He was being helped to help himself come out of that deep black hole of addiction
I stupidly asked him "Do you feel you are beating it yet
" and he said to me "I have a lifetime struggle ahead of me - if I ever think that I have beaten it , then I am lost"
He deserves our support
He needs the research to make sure that we have effective treatments and we need to give him that help and that confidence
taking the risk
unable to be here due to the postponement of this debate
As the Italian delegation , too , we wish to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou , on her excellent work
As many Members have reminded us , we are dealing with the difficulty of finding a balance , which , nevertheless , has been achieved
The difficulty stems from the different experiences and policies of the Member States
concern for our present , but also for our future
From the point of view of values , I am convinced of this and I totally agree with the ideas expressed by Mr Coelho , and therefore I will not repeat them
Frankly , I am uneasy listening to some positions that send this message to young people: get used to living with ecstasy , get used to living with valium , i
e
get used to a life full of drugs
I refuse to accept that politics should give way upon this issue
shall we say , of the political half-heartedness regarding the initiatives that the States still have not made
Therefore , this excellent idea to convene an "inter-pillar" Council is one we should support
that is , the experiences of treatment centres
I think that these should be supported and encouraged
Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou willingly accepted this request from the Italian delegation
today
The debate is closed

Counterfeit travel documents
Federal Republic of Germany with a view to adopting a Council Decision on the improved exchange of information to combat counterfeit travel documents (8457/1999 - C5-0011/1999 - 1999/0804(SNS))
This is a very uncontentious , uncontroversial report except for just one single point , which involves everybody who is listening
The proposal is to develop a computerised image archiving system to help detect forged travel documents
I imagine that we all agree that is worth doing
So what is the single point of controversy
It is whether this decision is going to be made behind closed doors in Brussels by officials and ministers , or whether there will be parliamentary scrutiny
Fifteen national parliaments cannot do so , because it is a European proposal and this task will fall to us if to anybody
by illegal immigrants
The proposal lapsed when the Amsterdam Treaty came into effect in May
It has now been retabled by the German Government , as a national government is entitled to do , under the Amsterdam Treaty
However , the problem is that the German Government says its purpose is to deal with I quote 'crime' and leaves out the word immigration
Why
Because under the Amsterdam Treaty , immigration questions are transferred from the third pillar to the first pillar and become the responsibility , for the first time , of Parliament
However , criminal matters remain in the third pillar and we have no area of scrutiny , no responsibility at all
Therefore , the German Government in my submission is seeking to avoid parliamentary scrutiny of its proposal
The committee did not like that
The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms invited the Finnish Presidency and the German Government to come and answer our questions about the proposal
The Finnish Presidency replied in a letter to the committee that it would not come , it would not answer our questions
However , it did say that we could ask put questions in plenary
Well , here we are in the plenary - where is the Council of Ministers
Everybody can see that the seats are empty except for one charming lady in grey who is an official and is not allowed to speak
But I hope she will take away this message
had a wonderful reputation for openness and democracy
I am also very sorry that they are not here to answer my accusation
carried by illegal immigrants
under the Amsterdam Treaty
Mr President , Commissioner , I should first like to congratulate the rapporteur
In his request to speak he referred to an important field , that is the institutional field and everything concerned with it
What I should like to do is to refer to the opportunities that this system offers us
The paper deals with combating the counterfeiting of travel documents
a false identity
That means that in order to be able to combat this phenomenon , which is partly a phenomenon of organised crime , we need new and very effective instruments
One instrument is the system discussed here to combat the counterfeiting of travel documents
After all , it should also help us to combat the crime of smuggling , which is on the increase
less risk than with drug-related crime
brought into the European Union by smugglers
These counterfeit documents are very often used in smuggling cases
In other areas too , where there is asylum abuse , there is counterfeiting of documents that are passed on from one person to another
Unfortunately this has become part of a system
In this regard , the system that Mr Newton Dunn described should be welcomed and supported
I should , however , like to mention one point with which we are not happy
That is the fact that in parallel we have developed the FADO system that allows us to compare original documents and counterfeit documents pictorially
In reality , we therefore have two systems that should be amalgamated in one system
Because rather than coming across counterfeit documents it is of course better if we have previously compared original and counterfeit documents via the FADO system
efficiency
Overall this action to combat counterfeit documents by comparing information that is not person-related is to be welcomed
that with the Schengen information system and the EURODAC information system together we can contribute to a safer Europe
Mr President , allow me to welcome the initiative by Germany to improve the exchange of information on counterfeit documents
This exchange of information is of great importance for the protection and security of people in Europe
Europe needs a legal area in which its citizens feel at home and protected
An essential contribution to this is the cross-border regulations and protection systems that make life difficult for criminals
The German initiative endeavours to achieve such a system
By exchanging information on counterfeit documents the counterfeiting itself is contained
That is an essential contribution to combating smuggling and other crimes and - I think this is very important - all other kinds of crime
So it is quite sensibly in the proposal for a Council Decision
The rapporteur wants to amend paragraph 3 of the preamble and limit the crimes to the offence of illegal immigration
He implies that illegal immigration is the greatest crime that we have to combat
My dear colleague , where do you actually live
Have you never heard anything about drug dealers and the couriers of the money launderers with suitcases full of bank notes
Do I really have to make you a list of travellers' crimes
Amendment 6 is a disgrace
It mocks our citizens who expect protection and security from the European Union
We must vote by a large majority against this amendment
the freedom to travel
as I said just now , I want this measure to apply to all crime
That is the reason why my Group will vote against all these amendments in the vote tomorrow morning
EU perimeter
I witnessed a significant degree of illegal immigration and fraudulent abuse of our generous asylum policy
to be bogus
This represents some 100 ,000 people per year including their dependants coming into my country
an Algerian who was living under the identity of a French citizen and who had bought his ID card on the Parisian black market
These are just some of the many abuses of which I have personal experience and we know that for the immigration authorities these examples are a daily occurrence
How can we expect our own immigration and police authorities to be able to crack down on the systematic abuse of our system
services and social security system as well as putting huge pressure on our limited housing stock
we have a permissive policy with instant rights to housing and social security benefits
exchange of such information , including that relating to forged travel documents in order to crack-down on crime , particularly international crime which respects no national boundaries
gain entry to wealthy western countries in the hope of making a new life for themselves
ministries to cooperate throughout the Union
done on a flexible , intergovernmental basis
Mr President , the comments by the previous speaker , Mr Tannock , should show Mr Newton Dunn why Mrs Gebhardt rejects his amendment
of movement in the European Union
meaning of the security policy of the European Union
That then led to a Member such as Mr Tannock giving an inflammatory speech about immigration
That goes together very well if you have the philosophy of a British Tory , which amounts to an anti-European view
However , this only marginally concerns Germany' s initiative to strengthen the security structures in Europe
But it does provide pretexts for the politicians who in the meantime colour every debate on security in Europe with the subject of illegal immigration
I should just like to say something here to our colleague from London: having heard your speech , I must ask you a question in return
Is Europe now really an immigration continent or not
If you answer in the affirmative with your lively description that Europe is an immigration continent should we not finally take action and create legal structures on immigration
You would be the first to say 'no' , I am quite sure of that
We are not a continent of immigration and we don' t need any immigration rules
But what does the whole debate show us
Mr Newton Dunn has perhaps chosen a sensible approach from the viewpoint of the European Parliament in order to increase our influence
We have already seen the political effects that that has
Remaining under the third pillar does integrate more groups of people , as Mrs Gebhardt has just said , that is to say , all criminals who forge travel documents
But we have not integrated the Parliament as strongly as with the Newton Dunn legal base
Overall , that shows that neither the third pillar nor the marginal transfer of responsibilities to another pillar are sufficient to create efficient security structures in Europe
Commissioner , you must together with us make that clear to the Council
You did so in Tampere , you did it before , and you must do it again
the associated speed of integration into new legislation on security structures in Europe and it does not operate in accordance with Amsterdam
We must draw the necessary conclusions from this , otherwise it will not work in practice
to Europe and those who , as Mrs Gebhardt rightly said , travel thorough Europe with a suitcase full of heroin but with counterfeit documents too
all the others , which does not alter the fact that you have undertaken a careful piece of work
You have indeed done that , but on this subject we differ greatly in our political views
Mr President , I have to give the House some good news , and I am sure you will welcome it as such
Yesterday' s newspapers , published today in press reviews across Italy , said: "Long-life gene discovered: life could be increased by a third" , or by 35% to be precise
Therefore , I think that , if at the moment I am hoping to reach 90 , I will actually reach 130
You will say , what does this have to do with counterfeit travel documents
I will tell you straight away
You know that I am the representative of the Pensioners' Party , elected to Parliament from that list
The pensioners are always asking me what they are cooking up in the pot in Brussels
as many of them as possible into boiling water
more pensioners can be boiled , if possible all together
they are in
combat crime and the trade in human beings is not avoided but confirmed
people and have their travel documents in order , then we are quite happy for them to enter
thief - but it would be much better to have a European electronic identity card which is the same in all the States
Above all , it would be much better for supervision at European borders to be increased , on the borders of Spain , Greece and Italy as well as Eastern Europe
It is pointless to invest money , effort and hard work for other reasons
We must prevent large numbers of people illegally entering the European Union who then go on to commit crimes
Mr President , the Commission would like to congratulate Mr Newton Dunn and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights on the work they have produced
documents should contribute , above all , to improving the monitoring of transit from external borders
In this sense , it is an important instrument in the battle against illegal or unauthorised immigration and against the networks that traffic in human beings
At the same time , the issue in question also falls within the scope of police cooperation and the fight against crime in general
Therefore , the choice of legal basis is an open one
of migratory flows
In this context , I shall not hide from the Chamber the fact that the Commission would prefer a legal basis which is based on the first Pillar
This could be in accordance either with No 2 , Article 62 , or under Article 66 of the EC Treaty
against cross-border crime , particularly in order to maintain police cooperation between Member States
instrument that we are discussing today will have to be integrated into a much larger system which will make the exchange of documents in general possible
the necessary measures to guarantee its management

Losses under loans for projects outside the Community
Africa) (COM(1999)142 - C5-0039/1999 - 1999/0080(CNS)
come up
because if possible , we want to decide before the Council and because we also want to make certain changes , which I shall refer to in detail
The provision of these guarantees concerns the countries of Central and Eastern Europe , the Mediterranean , Latin America , Asia and South Africa
and we shall then deal with it again or extend it until 31 January 2007
It involves a sum of EUR 9 475 million and the provision of guarantees amounting to a maximum of 60%
There are few inconsistencies in this regard
The inconsistencies are to be found in other areas
management , transparency and public work are concerned , is trailing rather far behind
is concerned
I therefore believe it is important that we deal with this subject more intensively
The European Investment Bank is the largest public bank in Europe , its general owners are the Member States and it works primarily with low-interest loans
equity capital , of 2
5 - market rates are usually over 10 - the Bank enjoys considerable confidence on the capital markets
This high level of confidence on the capital markets enables it to take up loans under favourable conditions and to on-lend at accordingly favourable rates
Furthermore , the Bank enjoys tax exemption and not least , guarantees from the EU budget for political risks too
past that was how it justified its relative inaccessibility for cooperation and monitoring to the public compared to other public institutions like the World Bank
In our view , that should and must now change as a matter of urgency
My report therefore also deals first and foremost with the subjects of accountability and transparency , that is , modern business practice
Over the last few years there has been a lot of criticism of the internal administration and business management of the EIB
Nevertheless , for a long time the Bank refused to allow the Court of Auditors or OLAF to inspect its books , invoking its special nature as a bank
control and allow OLAF , where necessary , to undertake inspections
inter-institutional agreement
"
We are now seeing the first signs that the Bank will open its books
However , in my view they are not yet adequate and there is still mistrust
to answers to his questions
draw up this report , and I should especially like to thank Mr Blak and Mrs Theato
efficiency
A business that cuts itself off will be taking its decisions on a very narrow basis
Dialogue with society in general , as the World Bank , among others , has been practising in the meantime , also provides information for investment decisions
the transport and environment sectors in Eastern Europe
duplication and to develop an acceptable and financially sustainable alternative
For this reason the Bank should undertake a public relations offensive in the regions that have received assistance
The European Parliament should therefore in the next few years direct its attention to the development of the EIB
The bases are set out in my report and I hope that they will be adopted tomorrow
Thank you very much
I have overrun a little , but I wanted you to understand what this report is all about because the report is all Greek to most people
I note , Mrs R√ºhle , that it is very difficult to stop you
You have overrun your allotted speaking time by 25%
That' s a huge amount
Mr President , Mrs R√ºhle has produced an excellent report on this subject
I am the newly appointed rapporteur on the EIB , the European Central Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
I agree with the amendments proposed by Mrs R√ºhle as they express clearly real concerns about the EIB's transparency , efficacy , accountability and conformity with the Community's objectives and policies
I will address briefly each of these concerns
Firstly , there is widespread concern about the EIB's transparency
opinion about the lack of transparency in the operations of the EIB
Even the World Bank and the East European NGO called Bankwatch have publicly stated this view
Secondly , let me turn to efficacy
Mrs R√ºhle states the need to evaluate the effectiveness of EIB operations
efficiency of the Bank
I am sorry to report to this House that Sir Brian has not even bothered to ring me or arrange to meet despite numerous telephone reminders
Such disregard for this new European Parliament will erode , yet again , public respect and confidence in the European Union
Thirdly , what about public accountability
activities , including in treasury operations , over the period 1993-1998
The questions are specific , detailed and relevant
They require a written response from the Bank
I have asked Sir Brian for such a response but , once again , he has chosen to ignore my request
not an EU institution obliged to respond to the European Parliament , the Court of Auditors or OLAF
Only matters relating to loans to non-EU countries where the Community gives loan guarantees can be discussed with Members of Parliament
I ask this House , what are the Member States
Are they not the governments of the people who live , work and pay taxes in the countries that we call Member States
Are we not , as the only elected representatives of the people of these Member States , expected to safeguard the interests of the people who live in the Member States
Does the Treaty specifically forbid the European Parliament from having access to information
Certainly not
Auditors and OLAF
Clearly , the Treaty needs to be amended to specify such access in bold print
I suggest that those involved in the IGC take note
to open its doors to OLAF and the Court of Auditors
open its doors to OLAF
It is about time this House told the Bank to open its doors to OLAF and the Court of Auditors
to the reconstruction of East Timor
risk cover by the Community budget
management by Community institutions

be developed with the utmost rigour and care
lost very considerable sums in short-term speculative operations , it became clear that there was a need to scrutinise the EIB' s investment policy thoroughly
The multiplying effect of a banking guarantee means that investments resulting from EIB credits are of crucial importance in the context of policies subsidised by the Community budget
It would not , therefore , be reasonable , through this guarantee , to support different policies from those decided on by the European Union
democratic decisions and for stringent , transparent rules
of view of the amounts of money that it has accumulated
We are sure that the EIB will continue to play this role in the future
Mr President , this report by Mrs R√ºhle is excellent , as it underlines the principles which the European Parliament has held as important when we have tried to improve our administration
The reports by Mrs R√ºhle and Mr Sepp√§nen both concern the same issue: guarantees against loans granted to the European Investment Bank
In itself , the European Investment Bank is an excellent instrument for financing specific projects
As the EIB has a high degree of creditworthiness , it can acquire cheap capital from the markets and target it at those areas the EU considers necessary
In this way the direct need for financial aid diminishes
There is a budget guarantee for those loans for which the EIB is responsible on behalf of the EU , which amounts to 70%
Now the matter being raised is the reduction of this figure
The Commission is proposing 60% , but the Council has decided on a provisional rate of 65%
For that reason , Parliament must first determine its position on what the correct rate should be
In determining the percentage figure our starting point is that the EU should bear the principal political risk relating to the financing of projects
to lending
That is normally the responsibility of the party granting the loan
In fact , the EU guarantee has also borne part of the financial risk , as these two different factors cannot be clearly distinguished from one another
EUR 200 million
be paid
Mr President , with these remarks I would like to express my support for the reports by Mrs R√ºhle and Mr Sepp√§nen
Mr President , the European Investment Bank' s activities are becoming ever more important , especially now that Eastern and Western Europe are to draw closer to each other
Bringing new countries from Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean area into the EU , like developing cooperation with other neighbouring countries , is not just a question of reaching good agreements
be integrated into
It is therefore a serious matter that it is now so unclear how much confidence can be placed in the Bank
The content and consequences of the EIB' s programmes must be developed in such a way that loans vigorously support the European Union' s political objectives
fight against poverty , the defence of democracy and human rights and the protection of the environment
Clearly , the European Union must continue to back the EIB and guarantee its loans , especially against political risks
and financing opportunities appear in different parts of the world
It is also important , however , not only to make improvements to the programmes themselves
Instead , there must also be improved public scrutiny of the Bank' s activities
For example , it is important that the Bank should work with clear , assessable objectives so that we might in actual fact ensure that the resources are used efficiently
the future
Many of my colleagues have spoken of the importance of openness
I shall just touch briefly upon this issue
All EU institutions , like the EIB , must now subject themselves to more stringent monitoring and supervision
That is why we are now demanding increased openness
It ought to be obvious that both OLAF and the Court of Auditors should have access to all documents which are required for the purposes of good supervision
That is the significance of the important amendment No 5 , and something which I understand that the Bank has now in fact begun to consider agreeing to
Mr President , as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control , I should like to thank Mrs Heide R√ºhle for the excellent teamwork
It has been a real pleasure to work together on this matter
The European Investment Bank is an important tool in connection with aid to developing countries but , in order to help , the Bank needs loan guarantees provided by the EU
The guarantees are necessary if the Bank' s potential is to be used fully
I should therefore like to recommend the report , but I also have just a couple of remarks about the Investment Bank
Combating fraud , muddle and incompetence in the EU' s systems is incredibly important
If we do not overcome the fraudulent use of taxpayers' money , the population of Europe is never going to regard us in a positive light
It makes cooperation more difficult
Combating fraud is therefore something which should be given the highest priority everywhere
This also applies to the Investment Bank
an agreement in regard to supervision of the Bank by the fraud office , OLAF
became at all possible to talk with its officials
It ought not to have been necessary for us to take steps of that kind
Bank
The fact that the Bank has now been opened up means that OLAF can ask for information from the Bank
It also means that the Bank should turn to OLAF whenever it discovers fraud
Then , things will really have started to move
Basically , the Investment Bank has now undertaken to cooperate to the maximum with OLAF in order to get to grips with fraud involving taxpayers' money
and properly
The Bank has therefore decided that OLAF must begin an investigation when it comes to the matter of EU resources
This is in actual fact a tremendous victory for Parliament , and I therefore want to say that it has been a pleasure for me to lead this struggle
Now , my colleague can take over , and I am quite sure that he will be a very popular man throughout the Bank
of the EIB , and another on the issues which I know concern this Parliament especially , those of transparency and the efficient use of the Bank' s resources
First point: In the ECOFIN of 8 November , a political agreement was reached on the Commission' s proposal of 23 April
It is true that the Member States still have some reservations
With the favourable opinion of the European Parliament we hope to approve this Council decision in the next meeting of the Council on the 29th of this month
the end of January and we need to reach a bilateral agreement between the Bank and the Commission
Therefore I would like to thank you for the work on the budget , especially Mrs R√ºhle , for her invaluable cooperation on this specific issue of the forecast of the issues
accept for either technical or economic reasons
Our positions are perfectly well known and I do not know if it is worth repeating them
I would simply insist perhaps on the last proposal , which refers to amendment 11
a Commission declaration to the Council rather than a modification of the decision
However the problem which has been of most concern in today' s debate is that of transparency and the efficient use of Community resources
some of you
Less negative in the sense that the framework of EIB relations with OLAF and the Court of Auditors is beginning to become clearer
will clearly have to be amended , if the European Investment Bank is receive the same treatment as the Community institutions
some decisions which , logically , do not correspond to other Community institutions
We are not talking about a greater or lesser degree of representation but rather simply a distribution of competences which at the time were defined in a particular way
Secondly: Having said that , in what respect do I believe we have moved forward
the loans subsidised with Community funds , which must undoubtedly be our main concern
It is true that we are still debating what will happen to the Bank' s activities in the cases where it uses own resources
from the Union
kind of issue
decided in accordance with the amendment of the Treaties
with the approval of the distribution of resources , the distribution of loans , as from next year and that Community procedures are not delayed

EIB loans to Turkey
guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans for projects for the reconstruction of the earthquake-stricken areas of Turkey (COM(1999) 498 - C5-0247/1999 - 1999/0212(CNS))
Mr President , in August Turkey experienced an earthquake which caused much destruction and suffering
In fact , we could describe it as a seismic storm , which is still affecting Turkey
It has been a time of insecurity there since August
The European Parliament has debated the issue of Turkey a good deal
At the Helsinki summit in December , Turkey will apparently become a candidate for membership , and it is expected to meet the EU membership criteria laid down at Copenhagen
We have often criticised Turkey here
We all know the problem regarding democracy in Turkey , which is the Kurdish problem
There are millions of people in the country who do not enjoy full political rights , and one of their leaders is awaiting execution in prison
There are other problems too , such as Cyprus
While discussing this report we have to set aside all the political problems
It is a question of humanitarian assistance to Turkey to repair the destruction caused by a mighty natural disaster
We should only be talking about how Turkey can be helped , and help is urgently needed
That is why the European Parliament must decide on the issue tomorrow
in accordance with the bank' s normal lending criteria
The bank has looked into Turkey' s ability to accept the loan and use the money to repair the damage caused by the earthquake
Turkey has the facilities for doing so
They are prepared to spend the money specifically on repairing the damage caused by the earthquake
The European Parliament is being asked to draft a report on the matter fast , as the EIB is ready to lend EUR 180 million this year already
For the purpose of the loan we have to activate the sum of EUR 16
4 million from the common guarantee reserves and transfer it into the guarantee fund for external action
according to normal procedure
In this connection there is a problem with regard to the competence of the various EU bodies , which has nothing to do with earthquake aid for Turkey
to be the right one
The emerging problem concerns the narrow framework imposed by the interinstitutional agreement on guarantees from the guarantee fund
The annual maximum amount the guarantee fund can cover is EUR 200 million
Mrs R√ºhle' s report , may approve its further reduction to 60% , as proposed by the Commission
reconciliation of the guarantee percentage rate with Mrs R√ºhle' s report
the guarantee fund that it eats into the fund for loans granted for other comparable unexpected emergencies
in respect of humanitarian disasters such as the one now being discussed
I have communicated this by way of a report to the Commission , and I hope they will give their replies today to the questions contained in it
The Commission is being asked to explain how the guarantee fund is generally used , and give a more detailed prognosis of the future use of marginals in reserves
threshold in the financial perspectives
This amendment may be adopted should the Commission's reply prove unsatisfactory
In my opinion , it is now time for the Commission to respond to the views expressed in the report
those wounded by the earthquake in Turkey last week , adding new wounds to those caused by the earthquake in August
We would like to assure the Turkish people of our support in these terribly trying times
and to relieve the hundreds of thousands of wounded
solely to restore the damage and relieve the wounded

Thank you , Mr Sepp√§nen , for your presentation and your report
I would like to make a few comments about your report
programme , whether a financial protocol or any other type
most recent earthquakes which have happened in Turkey
another in a programme of this type
Having made these initial comments , I would like to deal with the two problems mentioned in the report

According to our information , this is not the case
1999 of Euro 33 million , of 8
7 in 2000 , of 7 million -approximately- in 2001 and , although it is clear that in 2002 the situation will be completely different , there will also be surpluses in 2003
that we use the maximum forecast
Clearly you may ask me what would happen in the event that new situations such as this one may arise and we have to take further action

Report (A5-0066/1999) by Mr Napolitano , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on the amendments to the Rules of Procedure following the Interinstitutional Agreement of 25 May 1999 on
I have received a request for urgent procedure , in accordance with Rule 112 of the Rules of Procedure , from the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the
Madam President , yesterday I made a request , on behalf of my Group and the Liberal Group , and with the express support in the Assembly of the PPE-DE Group , for an
urgent debate and the approval of the interinstitutional agreement on OLAF , an agreement which was ratified during the last legislature , which was on the agenda for October and with regard
Madam President , I believe that we should show each other respect and consideration in this Assembly , and that we should not confuse freedom of expression with systematic insults and
First of all , I can say that our colleague Bar√≥n Crespo , whom I would describe not as an accomplice , but in all our political differences as an esteemed colleague ,
has given a correct account of the situation , as I explained orally to him , that we also , the Group of the European People' s Party and the European Democrats , wish
I gave this explanation orally to Baron Crespo , but did not sign the proposal , because just before his request that I sign it , I had a conversation with a representative
As the Group of the European People' s Party and the European Democrats , we said that we could and wished to help to carry it , if the problems in
the Napolitano report are resolved to a certain extent and they are indeed at the limit so that we can also vote , although in no way are we really happy
In the preamble to Mr Napolitano' s report , there is explicit reference to Article 199 of the Treaty of Amsterdam and this Article refers explicitly to the Rules of Procedure
The procedure that leads to this debate and to this decision - in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs as well - shows a large number of infringements of the Rules
I am therefore very surprised because the EPP started a discussion with the refusal of the qualified majority on the last vote in this House , which showed many Members
It is therefore incomprehensible that now , in view of the serious constitutional problems that this report raises , a course of action is chosen that is not covered by the
Nobody in this House - to make it clear once and for all - would speak out against expanding the efforts to combat fraud and on the responsibility of OLAF
But the fact that the Council has gone too far and has undermined the position of Parliament and openly questioned the independent mandate , the fact that investigations can be
carried out against independent Members of this House , because of undetermined legal notions - serious incidents - , because of a disciplinary law that does not exist , has rightly alarmed this
Rule 112 of our Rules of Procedure refers to Rule 60(1) , "A request that a debate on a proposal on which Parliament has been consulted pursuant to Rule 60(1)
As far as I am concerned , I consider - and once again this is what has influenced my thinking , but I shall ask Mr Napolitano if he agrees with
me - that the subject of Mr Napolitano' s report is the application of a text of a legislative nature , since it is to do with the Rules of Procedure
Considering that Mr Napolitano' s report concerns a text of a legislative nature , it seems to me that we are in the situation covered by Rule 60(1) , as referred
With the decision that we have now taken , that is to say , to place the Napolitano report on the agenda , there is a problem for the Committee on Citizens'

Madam President , just to clarify something to start with: We have been discussing the Eurodac report , that is to say , a system of control on the Member States' responsibility for
dealing with asylum and combating asylum abuse , for almost a year now and in spring this year the Social Democrats and the Greens , and others at the last minute , although
they had previously been in favour of the introduction of the system , changed tack and came out against the introduction of Eurodac , then in the form of the Convention and
We have discussed it at length in the Committee and are in full agreement with the Social Democrats and with the others , with the exception of the Greens who
On the vote in the Committee there were no proposals for amendment , but rather full agreement with the Social Democrats and also with the Liberals and with all the
That means that the same might happen as in the spring , that the Social Democrats will suddenly change tack for obscure reasons and suddenly vote against Eurodac , then they would
If against all expectations it does not come to that and the only alternative we had was to vote on it tomorrow , then it would be necessary to hold
We need a system for a common asylum procedure and to combat abuse in Europe and I have no time for party political games to the detriment of this
My committee has worked very hard to prepare Parliament's response to this proposal in time for the deadline set down by the Council and in time for the Council
However , if we are not able to have this debate this morning , if there are too many speakers down for the Napolitano report and the Giannakou report , then I would

The next item is the report (A5-0066/1999) by Mr Napolitano , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on the amendments to the Rules of Procedure following the interinstitutional agreement

Therefore , the requisite 24 hours laid down in the Rules of Procedure have not passed , either for the debate or for the vote , so I would like to ask
the President whether we are going to enforce an urgency that completely violates the Rules this time as well , because , in that case , we can throw the Rules of Procedure
I would therefore like to know whether this debate and the vote will take place in exactly the same way as the debate on the Napolitano report , in contravention
To tell the truth , given that the issue is considered very sensitive by many , I regret the fact that the debate and what I am about to say on
The text , which did not obtain the required qualified majority during October' s part-session in this Chamber , has been amended on the initiative of the largest political group , which
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has , in fact , adopted three amendments by Mr M√©ndez de Vigo , which , for the purposes of the implementation of the interinstitutional agreement within Parliament , give
In addition , the Committee has adopted an amendment by Mr Nassauer and Mr Brok , that is the new Article 4 of the model decision , and I shall quote the
Thus , we have further strengthened the guarantee , which was already present in several parts of the text , of full compliance with the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities - and , in
particular , I want to mention Article 10 of the Protocol , which is very precise and exhaustive - and full compliance with the related Rules , in particular , Rule 6 of the
So allow me to say to those Members who have expressed doubts and concerns that , thanks to these amendments tabled by Members from the European People' s Party , they can
However , I must immediately recall and reaffirm what the mandate given to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs was - President Fontaine reminded us too - and the subject of the
our internal regulations , so that it can be applied within Parliament , on the basis of an opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control; to amend the Rules of Procedure
Personally , I am in the same situation: Parliament gave its President the mandate to sign this interinstitutional agreement on 6 May last year , and it was signed on 25
I respect the opinion of those Members - newly elected or already Members of Parliament - who have expressed reservations and concerns about this Agreement , but I had to consider
What you perhaps consider worrying , what you will read , is not a Parliamentary decision; it is the model decision that is part of the interinstitutional agreement , already published -
I would like to conclude by pointing out that , if the experience of implementing this interinstitutional agreement suggests that that some of its aspects need to be discussed with the
It was the intention of the agreement to find a solution to the whistle-blower problem , that is to say , to the question of what an official should do if
I would have preferred to take up the original proposal by the Committee on Budgetary Control in its opinion for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , in which this whole
I believe he is right , that this is an issue that was difficult to incorporate into our Rules of Procedure and that , in the end , it has been resolved
That discussion which we held in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the means by which any possible illegal activity could be brought to the knowledge of OLAF , I
believe has led us to a suitable means , because a political body must have a filter which can examine whether this information is well-founded or not and whether or not
Therefore , Mr President , I believe that the amendments which we have introduced in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs fulfil the objective of reconciling the decision of the three institutions with
The other , who I consider to be the father of the current regulation , is Mr Napolitano , who has shown great moderation , intelligence and , above all , courage , in the quest

My group has considered it very carefully and we conclude that it is a technical putting into effect of the agreement that the Parliament has signed on parliamentary immunity ,
Parliament's assent to this agreement is already five months late , and the public simply would not appreciate a further refusal to make progress and to create a strict but
However , what we have not fought for and are most resolutely against and where we see the position of Parliament and of the independent mandate jeopardised to a great
extent , is if investigations can be initiated against freely elected Members of Parliament , not only on suspicion but on mere supposition if a system of compulsory informing is set up
Just imagine , that investigations against Members of Parliament for serious incidents in the performance of their duties - a completely fabricated undefined legal concept that contradicts the constitutional tradition of
each of the fifteen Member States - could be introduced , that investigations could be initiated if Members of Parliament contravene duties comparable with the disciplinary law for career public servants ,
That is an overall authorisation of an authority that not only exposes the Members of Parliament to all kinds of informing but which opens a system of informing and
I should like to say to Mr Corbett that a Member of the European Parliament has never been above the law , even if these Rules of Procedure are not
I am of the opinion that we must ensure that the freedom of the individual Members of Parliament , including those who belong to a minority , must be protected from
political pressure from outside and from within , so that they are not overrun with proceedings so that they are in the end so involved that they cannot deal with the

Mr President , I am speaking here not only as the rapporteur but also in my capacity as the spokesman of the European People' s Party , but first of all as
Ladies and gentlemen , I earlier appealed to you all to discuss Eurodac and to vote on it today , because Eurodac is a system that finally enables us to implement the
In this Dublin Convention , that was concluded in 1990 , the responsibility is established of a Member State' s competence to deal with an asylum procedure - according to this
Therefore under Eurodac , every Member State is bound to take the fingerprints of all asylum-seekers , all illegal immigrants who are picked up at the border in order to compare whether
On the vote in the Committee on the Eurodac system there was full agreement , only the Group of the Greens was against the system as a whole and introduced
That is , in the view of the Committee , with the full support of the Social Democrats as well , in Eurodac we have an instrument for an orderly asylum procedure
It is not a matter of criminalising somebody , but giving the Member States the responsibility , giving them the duty of dealing with the asylum procedure and also of protecting

The second point that I should like to make here is that when you express regret about the poor Social Democrats and the contradictions between them and the German government ,
In his letter , Mr Schily referred to the difficulties that we as Social Democrats have picked as a central theme in this consultation procedure and gave his opinion from
This letter arrived in the last few days and it gave rise to a lively debate in the Social Democratic Group that led to us asking you to give
, but we know your position and what you will say: We have the majority here , we will get it through and anyone who is not with us is actually
The Council has said , and there is some understanding in our Group for this , that we need to extend the registration system for asylum-seekers to other target groups and
protection from this persecution , from those who have , for example , entered a country illegally or who have smuggled people in , or from those who have been smuggled in against
Because we believe that this discussion is not yet at an end and because we also wish to discuss the subject again with Minister Schily , we have asked you
Member States will have little incentive to fingerprint third country nationals whom they find illegally on their territory , if there is a risk that they may become responsible for
Nonetheless , we believe that the debates in this House , in our committee , have been such that we have a good report drawn up here with the support of most
We will not support amendments 13 to 20: although we share concerns about finger-printing , we believe that the attempt to stop a register being created will fail to deal
Mr Prodi , Mr President , with regard to Eurodac and the viewpoint of the Greens and the European Free Alliance , I must say that I welcome the subtle distinctions made by
Neither would I wish to see the Greens held responsible for the organised crime in this world , as people will shortly be saying we are responsible because we are
This report hardly constitutes a foundation , in fact , it is even a little reprehensible , in my opinion , although the amendments submitted make it more acceptable and tone it down
When investigations are undertaken into organised crime , it is necessary to be completely clear on people' s identity in order to track down the criminals and for the benefit
It is now being proposed that illegal immigrants as young as 14 years of age should also be covered by the arrangements in question , while the Dublin Convention is
It just gives the authorities increased opportunities for exercising control and , in any state based on the rule of law , very serious attention must necessarily be given to the
We hope that Parliament will again dig in its heels over this frontal assault on the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the Convention on the
If a fingerprint register is to be established , we do not under any circumstances want asylum-seekers to be mixed together with either legal or illegal immigrants , and we want to
We think that this is a departure from the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which requires that we protect children and which recommends 18 years as the
If a register is to be established , we propose that it should be possible for a person' s records to be erased as soon as that person has received a
I can essentially go along with what Pernille Frahm has just said , and we shall also support her amendment which , in spite of everything , does nonetheless mitigate this dreadful piece
It is , of course , evident from Protocol No 5 to the Amsterdam Treaty on the position of Denmark , that Title IV of the Treaty does not apply to Denmark ,
Next , I should like to ask the Commissioner if this is to be viewed in connection with what is dealt with in Article 5 of the Protocol I mentioned ,
It is an effective defence mechanism , and what is being put in place is a complete and consistent absence of legal rights for one large group of people , namely
There are no elementary rules concerning legal rights in connection with the registration procedure and in connection with the right to pass on this information held by the Member
I want to say that this is the most repressive system we have experienced in Europe in this century , at any rate in the perspective of the Nordic legal
Ladies and gentlemen , I would remind you that this total absence of legal rights is to be established by virtue of conditions in the Treaty which concern and proclaim
What , in fact , we are dealing with here is the very opposite and , to crown it all , Mr Pirker' s report also attaches importance - and this is the
Mr President , in my own small country alone , we will have between 35 ,000 and 40 ,000 alleged asylum seekers this year , in addition to tens of thousands of asylum seekers of
the past few of years who are still waiting for their cases to be resolved , and on top of this , there are an estimated 150 ,000 illegal immigrants , which means that
We will gladly approve the Pirker report and I would ask the rapporteur to consider the criticism that follows as minor criticism of an otherwise sound report which represents
After all , it must be clear that the Eurodac database should not just serve the purpose of establishing which Member State might deal with a particular asylum seeker' s
After all , the fingerprints of illegal immigrants may not be kept ten but two years , may not be compared with each other - one wonders why - and may
I fear that this illustrates that , according to some , the Eurodac system should serve , perhaps not exclusively but largely , at any rate , to assign a particular Member State the
And while there are plenary sittings and meetings under way at the same time , it would be a good thing if all the rooms had screens , if that is
We have already rejected a report which intended , in unclear terms , and for who knows what reason , to take the fingerprints of the illegal immigrants who arrive in the
This new proposal says that the fingerprints of illegal immigrants - because we are talking about the extension of the existing EURODAC programme to illegal immigrants - will only be
taken in application of the Dublin Asylum Convention , that is to say , only in order to find out whether these immigrants have asked for asylum in another Member State of
We are not opposed to this idea , on the contrary , we are not against clarifying whether there is a Member State responsible for the handling of the case if it
But we have many doubts about this massive taking of fingerprints - because we believe it will be massive - of people who have crossed borders illegally or who
Although it is not necessary to mention it , I should nevertheless like to say to all those who agree with the criticism without knowing the position , that of course
Because we consider that a fair sharing of the burden is an important aspect of asylum policy , we are also in favour of introducing all relevant measures just as
Again , my group would agree with that , but we want to make certain of this , which is why safeguards are necessary to ensure that there are no abuses by
I believe that there are some on the right of this House who wish to muddy the waters and to draw no distinction between asylum seekers and illegal immigrants , third
There seem to be , though , Members of this House who have no sympathy with either group - and if there were aliens from another planet , they would probably have
The safeguards and the amendments that we are asking for are designed to ensure that any data collected is processed properly and that where people are granted asylum or
On the age limit , it is sometimes very difficult to tell the age of a young person , but there seems to be a consensus that 18 is a fair
I accept , as I am sure we all must do , that people do not leave their homes and families and travel half-way across Europe thousands of miles away for
They do not do just it on a whim , they do it for a real reason and we must accept and respect the fact that they need support and
I hope - and I am sure the Commissioner is listening - we can make certain that when this system comes into full operation , it is used positively , humanely
First of all , I would like to say to the honourable Members that in the view of the Commission , the EURODAC Regulation is instrumental to the implementation of the Dublin
If governments and citizens can be confident that we have effective arrangements in place to decide which state is responsible for considering an asylum claim and to tackle the problem
This will provide financial assistance from the Community budget for the reception , the integration and the voluntary return of refugees , displaced persons and asylum-seekers which is a relevant instrument
I shall also be unveiling a proposal for an instrument on asylum procedures after we have received the opinion of Parliament on our working document towards common standards on asylum
When we converted the EURODAC Convention and Protocol into a Community Regulation , we amended it to bring it fully into line with Community law on data protection including the new
The Commission can accept amendment No 1 to avoid the term 'alien' and instead refer to third country nationals , although we will have to make it clear that the Regulation
We can also accept the principle of amendment No 6 which makes it clear that there is only a match if fingerprints are identical and not if they are
just similar , and we accept also the principle of amendment No 12 which is intended to make it clear that data must never be sent to an asylum applicant's country
I take this opportunity to assure Mrs Terr√≥n i Cus√≠ that illegal immigrants' fingerprints are only used for the specific purpose of the Dublin Convention - which means for
On the minimum age-limit my approach is to stick to the compromise minimum age-limit of 14 years which was agreed in previous negotiations , but to accept your amendment which makes
As far as the rules on erasure of data are concerned , the amendments approved by the Committee on Citizens' Rights provide for the erasure of data as soon as anyone
I can accept this in relation to people who are apprehended irregularly crossing the external border of the European Union and who are fingerprinted under Article 8 of the
If we were to erase all data on asylum applicants as soon as they were granted any kind of legal status , EURODAC would no longer cover situations where an
asylum applicant is granted permission to remain in some other capacity for a short time and , at the end of this period , moves to another Member State and claims asylum
They have therefore argued that data on recognised refugees should be blocked in the central unit so that statistical data can be compiled to measure the scale of the
If people who have been recognised as refugees in one Member State seek asylum in another Member State this is likely to be because refugees do not enjoy the
We should seek to remedy this by including refugees within the scope of an instrument defining the circumstances in which a third country national who is legally resident in
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0063/1999) by Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou , on behalf of the Committee on Citizen' s Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Internal Affairs , on the
communication from the Commission to the Council , the European Parliament , the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions concerning a European Union action plan to combat drugs
However , the debate here today may help to raise Parliament' s awareness of the massive threat which drugs represent , on the basis of real rather than imaginary data , and
Let me say straight away , Mr President , that we approve and endorse the Commission' s programme; however we have formulated a number of reservations , the same reservations formulated by the
Over the last fifteen years , Mr President , drugs have not just been a vague threat: the number of synthetic drugs has increased , as has the quantity of cocaine imported
They have become a deliberate threat derived from the relationship between organised crime and drug trafficking , the trade in arms and nuclear materials and the emergence of new criminal
What is important is that we understand that , if we are to aim for long-term prevention , we must implement policies to abolish the drugs trade and provide treatment for
The Portuguese presidency therefore needs to take the initiative and create an inter-pillar council which will meet on a yearly basis in order to coordinate all the action taken
There must be full and correct application of the resolutions of the United Nations Organisation and the Special Session and , Mr President , Commissioner , a special anti-drugs clause which commands
Any unequivocal solution or any solution of an administrative nature which fails to take account of the full extent of the real public health problem and the medical aspects
It is a major political problem which basically accounts for or is linked to 80% of international crime , while 50% of transactions throughout Europe relate solely to the trade
If the Summit , which we feel should deal directly with this matter , fails to understand that this is a most serious political issue , which stretches far into the future and
that our inability to deal with it multilaterally , as we should , has started to become more and more apparent , creating disappointment among our citizens , then we shall be unable to
What is important is that we improve the indicators , improve the public health aspects and give a larger number of citizens the chance to realise the extent of the
Many within the Committee on Industry are also of the opinion that the fight against addiction cannot be undertaken without respect for the drug user but the Committee on Industry
I should also extend my sincerest gratitude to Parliament , particularly to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs and the rapporteur , Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou , for the quality
The main general targets for the European Union's strategy against drugs for the next five years can be summarised as follows: to reduce significantly the prevalence of illicit drug use
among young people under 18 years of age; to reduce substantially the number of drug-related deaths; to increase considerably the number of successfully treated addicts and to reduce substantially the
In the field of demand reduction , preventive measures and programmes for children and young people should , instead of focusing exclusively on illegal drugs , address addiction in general , including aspects of
The establishment of voluntary monitoring mechanisms for new chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of synthetic drugs , as well as enhanced cooperation with trade , will constitute the major priorities
Following the Tampere European Council , priority has to be given to the prevention of juvenile , urban and drug-related delinquency and to the progressive harmonisation of European Union legislation on
The implementation of five harmonised key indicators - demand for treatment by drug users , drug-related deaths , mortality and causes of death among drug-users , the incidence of drug-related infectious diseases , the
comparability of surveys of drug use , behaviour and attitudes towards drugs in the general population and finally , the comparability of the prevalence estimates of problem drug use - plays an
We will , as well , have the possibility of working together with European institutions on the organisation of an interinstitutional conference to discuss the implementation of the European Union drugs
The Commission's communication represents , in my opinion , a good starting point for a global , multidisciplinary and integrated European strategy to fight illicit drugs on the line that was approved by
I am , therefore , confident that we have the potential and will find the political will to respond to the new challenges in the perspective of the 2000-2004 European Union
Madam President , I would just like to remind you and the Members that the Radical Members present - Mr Della Vedova , Mr Cappato , Mr Dupuis , Mr Dell'Alba and Mr Turco

Madam President , rapporteur , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission very much welcomes the report by the rapporteur and it especially welcomes the proposal for an amendment , which has been submitted by
It would therefore request the Council to support this proposal in order to smooth the way so that by restructuring and reducing expenditure this year EUR 670 million can

A split vote has been requested on recital C from our side , but looking at the voting papers , I think that a word may have been included that should

There was an oral explanation by Mr Chichester , that against the amendment he wished to keep the words "free and fair" in any case and that we should take
If we get to vote on the original text of that paragraph , if we get past the vote on the amendment , at that point I want to propose a
That was also what Mrs Maes said first of all , so it would be easiest if we voted separately on each of these three words , then we shall have
In negotiations as important as the ones involved here , it is essential for our message to be extremely clear , and , if you agree , I think we may indeed create

Madam President , to save time , now that Amendment No 70 from the Europe of Nations Group has been rejected by an overwhelming majority , could you apply the provisions of Rule
130(7) , which states that the President may decide , following the adoption or rejection of a particular amendment , that several other amendments of similar content or with similar objectives be put
I should like to ask that group in future to check how many of individual Members can table amendments in plenary - 15 different Members of the EPP have
I agree those last few words have now been modified by one of the amendments we accepted , but we would still like to have a separate vote on those
Madam President , I believe that Mr Corbett , instead of concerning himself with the amendments of the Group of the European People' s Party , should concern himself with clarifying the situation
Madam President , we already mentioned this earlier this morning: The important report by Mr Pirker , according to what we have now voted on , although we proposed something else this morning ,
I would therefore request that we adjourn the vote on the Pirker and Giannakou reports and the debates until the December part-session in Brussels and would request that we vote
As far as I know , this evening and tomorrow too , most certainly , many of the Members of the European Parliament will be in attendance , as we have been able

Moreover , the result is a black day for the Parliament , because through it , what the majority of the Parliament has decided , the Parliament becomes an authority and the Members
If I think about it , the fact that the Members of Parliament according to this text are bound to assist in the work of OLAF and if they are
I should like to state that such a decision that destroys the parliamentary system can clearly not be accepted but that we , and not myself alone , but many others too ,
Although this office has been established with the excuse of supervising the officials and elected representatives of the European institutions , the way this office has been designated and the
We are in favour not only of total transparency regarding the operation of all European institutions , but also of the election and the admissibility , at any time , not only of
Given the non-democratic nature of the European Union' s decision-making bodies , the establishment of OLAF appears to be a derisory measure intended to provide a semblance of supervision even

It is true that the Court of Auditors does not get a good press in this House since the President refused it a press conference room , even though he happily

The names of the cases tell the whole story: Agusta in Belgium , Urba in France , Palermo in Italy , fictitious jobs in the Parisian public transport network - RPR , the
But , because we in the Front National do not suffer the anxiety affecting the potential accused in the other parties , we are rejecting the extension of police powers to that
Firstly , because OLAF contravenes the idea of the separation of authority , which is the bedrock of Western democracy , with officials who have no legitimacy supervising the representatives of the sovereign
Secondly , because OLAF is the thief set to catch the policeman , since the European Commission , at the centre of the suspicions of corruption , is in fact , by means of OLAF ,
or the democratic route , by creating a body at the heart of the European Union , as in Great Britain and the United States , which is the equivalent of the British
So , the expert body does exist , but with a connection to the representatives of the people who alone have the right to ask for explanations regarding the use of their
For example , the final mandate granted by the Council on 22 October , makes no mention of defending the principle of Community preference , a principle which had however been adopted
In every field , one might say that the internal concessions made in order to arrive at a unified European position , declared beforehand to be desirable , are leading us to
Secondly , the Commission was given a comprehensive negotiation mandate on a whole series of issues , some of which come under Community jurisdiction , but others , such as services or investment , which
Nonetheless , the Council , without explicitly saying so , has just set in train a process which may lead it , if it is not stopped , to an absolute negotiating mandate being
granted to the Commission and thus , in application of the new Article 133(5) of the Treaty of Amsterdam , to the ultimate power of ratification being taken away from the national
Thirdly , despite our requests , we note that the Seattle negotiations are going to be undertaken before a clear , specific and comprehensive report has been made of the consequences of the
But this study should have been carried out on many other points , such as the impact of liberalisation , in its current form , on the preservation of cultural and social
That being the case , we would have liked Parliament to propose a very political specification to the Commission , instead of drawing up a more diplomatic report which deplores , stresses
The tone of the report is still too liberal , then , for us to find any reflection of our own views , especially since none of our amendments is included in
As regards the MAI , which was rejected by the OECD and which is coming back again , a reinforced code of conduct must be drawn up for investment and strict
It stresses in particular the labelling of foodstuffs in order to ensure the implementation of food safety , and the necessity of adopting a stance that is more favourable to
At any event , we shall follow with great interest the way in which the Commission conducts the negotiations , and even though we still find this amended report too liberal in
We therefore consider that the overarching strategies and objectives , as described in the report , for the forthcoming round of World Trade Organisation negotiations are a step in the right
If , however , the objectives are to become a reality , we should particularly like to emphasise section I , to the effect that agriculture must be one of the areas in the
If this agreement is really to become the development agreement which helps reduce the gulf between the world' s rich and poor States , it is not acceptable to reject ,
The World Trade Organisation should support the work being done in terms of the global environment by , for example , incorporating basic principles of environmental policy , such as the precautionary principle ,
In fact , it is merely the representative of the most powerful industrialists and financial groups in the European Union , rivals to the American or Japanese trusts in systematically bleeding
But what of the protection of workers , particularly against the tragedy of unemployment , even in the richest countries of the European Union , precisely those which would easily have adequate
Any number of multinationals who employ a workforce with a practically zero wage , without the advantage of any form of social protection , in Africa or Asia , have their headquarters
We shall not vote in favour of the proposed report , nor shall we amend it , since it is the capitalist organisation of the economy , with or without the WTO , which
- (FR) The Millennium Round , which is due to start shortly within the World Trade Organisation , the WTO , must provide an opportunity for Europe , since we are bound by
the condition of speaking with a single voice , not only to present itself as unified for the duration of the negotiations , but also to demonstrate the utmost firmness with regard
While , however , the Fifteen have recently adopted a joint negotiation policy in the context of the new round , which promises to be an ambitious one , it must be acknowledged that
Indeed , there is no doubt but that this compromise text , whose birth was so painful , will be subject to many pressures from the American side in the negotiations , even though
the homogeneity of the Union is only a fa√ßade , and the Union has no legal arsenal available to it comparable with that in the hands of the United States , one
While the organisation of free and fairer world trade must be encouraged and reinforced within the framework of a multilateral commercial system , it must also ensure that all nations , rich
and poor , and I am thinking in particular of the countries of Africa , are guaranteed the possibility of making the most of the advantages which this round of negotiations is
Indeed , although we must wait for the round of negotiations to be completed before passing judgement on the content as far as the results achieved are concerned , the fact remains
that , as far as this context is concerned , the overall result could not be deemed completely negative if the nations of Europe were to manage to obtain stricter control of
The European Union' s starting negotiating position , which is ambitious in its objectives , is bound not to emerge stronger from a round of negotiations which is in danger of dragging
on and on and getting bogged down , particularly given the foreseeable attitude of the United States , which will not rest from attempting to progressively undermine the mandate which has been

Similarly for the countries of the third world , the question is knowing whether they will still be able to escape the clutches of the mega-multinationals produced by the mega-mergers
However , for the European Union , the establishment of an analysis shared with the countries of the third world could have been the foundation for the alliance which we are
Secondly , the DSB (Dispute Settlement Body) , created within the WTO , has demanded that the European Union give up its own standards in fields as fundamental as health and food safety
The question from now on is knowing if it is possible to accept a situation where , if one thing leads to another , decision after decision , ruling on everything on
the pretext of settling commercial differences , the DSB may end up establishing itself as a sort of world-wide Supreme Court , imposing its views in all areas on elected governments and
This is why we cannot accept challenges to the Lom√© Agreements and our policy of cooperation in the form in which we have constructed it in the Lom√© Agreements
It must promote a vision based on a multipolar world and encourage the formation of regional associations integrated both economically and politically , as we have been doing ourselves for
The second principle should be that the WTO must be "confined" to a strictly defined role , and sectors which should only come under the remit of the sovereignty of states
Public and social services such as education or health , but also those where consumer safety and collective interests are involved , such as public transport or air traffic control , culture
In the agreements on intellectual property , Europe must resist the patenting of living organisms , it must guarantee that derogations to the general trade regulations for medicinal products used to
Fundamental human rights and the Universal Declaration of 1948 , the conventions of the ILO (International Labour Organisation) or conventions on the environment , are in essence superior to the standards
We must reverse the unbalanced situation arising from the fact that having multilateral commercial agreements alone has led to the creation of a legal-style body , whereas this was not
Unfortunately , in the course of the plenary sitting , the rapporteur and the PPE and ELDR groups introduced a number of amendments into the text which tone down the social
Considering , furthermore , the unfavourable outcome reserved for the amendments proposed by myself and my fellow members of the French Socialist delegation and the GUE/NGL and Greens/ALE Groups , I abstained ,
But I believe that one of the most significant elements , on the eve of this new round , one which distinguishes it from the previous rounds , is the intrusion of society ,
I believe that we should be pleased at this , since it provides the best guarantee that it will not be possible to omit these issues in the course of
- (FR) The new round of negotiations of the World Trade Organisation , due to open in Seattle on 30 November , should provide an opportunity to establish better control of
The doubt concerns our capacity , and our real determination , to make the WTO an instrument of regulation in order to make the transition from globalisation sought by the few
Indeed it is this doubt which gives rise to my concern that if we do not succeed on this point , then we shall be forced to renege on longstanding commitments
At the risk of denting our clear conscience , I would at this point like to mention the example of the banana dispute , or the multinationals (Del Monte , Dole and
Chiquita) which , with the support of the United States , are flooding the European market with bananas which are the product of slavery , produced , what is more , in conditions of the
most dubious food safety and have managed to force us to our knees; a matter in which we are on the verge of unconditional surrender , abandoning hundreds of thousands of
And recent statements by the Commission are not such as to allay this concern , saying , for example , that it is necessary to put an end to the banana conflict since
The same applies to rum , since we have signed a unilateral agreement with the United States on the import of colourless spirits , and that includes rum , which will inevitably
What will happen tomorrow , unless we are particularly vigilant , in the case of sugar , which is a crucial element in the economic balance of ACP countries such as Mauritius
The truth is , I am afraid , that whatever our fine statements , often with a touch of paternalism , we are on the verge of writing off our policy with regard to
Therefore , even though the resolution put to the vote this morning is a text which is perfectly acceptable in terms of the general objective which we have set ourselves , particularly
thanks to the many amendments proposed by the members of my group , I did not vote in favour of this text , so as to fulfil the commitments which I have
- In the weeks leading up to the agreement of this resolution , many MEPs have sought to ensure Europe's stance is one which genuinely makes this a "Development Round"
in the WTO , that developing countries are enabled to be full partners in the negotiating process , and to underline that the benefits of trade must be focused to combat increasing
On the extension of the WTO too include investment , I welcome the fact that the European Parliament has reiterated it strongly held position that the mistakes of the MAI must
not be repeated , that investor responsibilities according to ILO and OECD guidelines must be dealt with alongside investor rights , and - by a clear majority - a European Code of
I condemn the Conservative group in this Parliament who sought to remove development considerations from the proposed Standing Forum with the ILO , and incredibly sought to remove from our objectives ,
But the fact that they were prepared to vote for protection of "strict legal requirements" met by European farmers , but against the destructive dumping of agricultural goods by us in
Increased coherence between trade , labour , environmental , animal welfare and other internationally accepted regulations and principles of 'corporate governance' through improved cooperation between the WTO , the ILO , the United Nations , the
- (PT) The importance of the negotiations about to take place under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation , which will open in Seattle on 30 November , is of
course due to an agenda that covers huge areas of human activity: from agriculture to cultural activities , transport to education and health , copyright and designations of origin to foreign investment ,
Some issues are particularly important - and they become particularly serious - because the guidelines which it is being sought to impose on them are obvious , such as liberalisation and
This type of objective is cropping up in such topical matters as food safety , public services and "intellectual property" , always in favour of a blind liberalisation of capital
It is , nevertheless , obvious that there other ways of achieving this , ways that are quite different from those currently in force and to those being planned , and this places
Apart from this , this regulation will always need to be guided by principles of cooperation and development; it will need to include respect for social and environmental standards adhered to
throughout the world; it will need to respect the wishes , interests , specific differences and different degrees of development of the States concerned; it will need to respect and promote preferential
A multilateral approach to this problem is required , whilst nothing is stopping the developing countries from adopting a sound agricultural policy , that is to say preventing or restricting , by means
As our chairman , Mr Pasqua , specified in the course of the general debate which took place during the part-session at the beginning of October , and as my colleague , Mr Berthu ,
has just mentioned , it is essential , before undertaking a new round of negotiations , to make a clear and specific assessment , one that is objective , and thus independent and takes into
The failure to carry out an assessment may be analysed as the wish to hide the very mixed reality of the effects of the deregulation of world trade from the

The Commission has acted and is continuing to act in these three case as if it wishes to ensure that there will be no outstanding disputes between the European Union
Instead of proclaiming the need for European concessions from the rooftops , the Commission would do better to forcefully assert the need to set right the errors and omissions of
The Commission therefore prefers , whether its representative is called Mr Brittan or Mr Lamy , to undermine our positions in advance regarding the precautionary principle , health safety and environmental protection ,
as well as economic interests in rural areas and , in the case of bananas , to make light of the special historic relations which our countries maintain in the form of

There is a refusal to see that the more federal Europe is becoming , the more distant it is becoming from the peoples of Europe , and the more disaffected they
Sweeping aside this niggling detail , and many others too , the Commission feels more comfortable in proposing yet more federalism , extending majority voting to the Council , and constitutionalisation of the
This can be clearly seen with the embargo on British beef and it is unrealistic to believe that it is possible to go further , with yet more constraints , within

The Swedish Christian Democrats in the European Parliament' s Committee on Constitutional Affairs have therefore , in the form of Amendment No 5 , pressed for the inclusion of the following

What other purpose can there be to all these proposals which we hear and which , generally speaking , are incorporated into the report , on voting changes in the Council , on
changes to the number or responsibilities of Commissioners , on reduced grass roots representation in the EC following the increase in the number of Member States , other than to strengthen the
position of the rich countries of the EU , to strengthen the position of monopoly undertakings , the majority of which are established in those countries and to play down grass roots
What purpose can there be to the attempt to generalise the voting rule and the substantive , perhaps even formal repeal of the veto , despite deceptive grievances deliberately expounded to the

This was proven by the campaign against Yugoslavia which , in addition to being illegal , was also unnecessary , at least for the reasons quoted , because it was made glaringly clear
The clearest proof of the type of security being promoted is provided by the Amsterdam Treaty itself , the incorporation of the Schengen acquis , the creation of a Community prosecution service

Where section 27 is concerned , we view as considerable progress the fact that the so-called Petersberg Tasks in the Cologne document (humanitarian and rescue tasks , peace-keeping tasks and tasks of
The Petersberg Tasks mean that non-aligned and neutral States have an opportunity to participate in conflict and crisis management and , for that reason , there is no basis for integrating
That is why we must also be careful not to place obstacles or stumbling blocks in the way of the Intergovernmental Conference's ending on time and of its results
Mr Dimitrakopoulos' s and Mr Leinen' s report paves the way for a very thorough overhaul which we do not think it will be possible to implement within the established

- (PT) I do not think that the report which has been approved by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and submitted for the approval of this plenary sitting merits
1 - It makes requirements for revision beyond those that are laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam , in such broad and general terms that it is not clear what
Particularly because it omits points for revision that I consider to be essential and that were agreed on in the opinions of other Parliamentary Committees , such as a revision
of own resources , a revision of social cohesion , reform of the CAP , the extension of first Pillar competences in terms of the Area of Freedom , Security and Justice , reform of
2 - The revision centres on an agenda that essentially only concerns issues of decision-making power and a corresponding new balance between Member States , which will reduce , in the name
of fairness , the weight of economically less developed States in favour of the more economically powerful ones , to which it is being attempted to give the mechanisms for strengthening their
3 - Consequently , it accepts , by giving the Commission carte blanche to propose it , a redistribution of the weighting that each State holds in the wake of what can already
be seen in the administrative and operational organisation of the Community executive , which threatens the historical and constituent principle of the European project which has always successfully stood firm on
4 - Consistent with the positions that I have always maintained in Parliament , regarding a revision of Maastricht and Amsterdam , with the aim of keeping sacrosanct the founding historical balance
between large and small countries , I cannot approve this resolution which will open up a "Pandora' s box" for a Treaty that accepts as fair the supremacy of some States
- (PT) The new Intergovernmental Conference which is due to open at the beginning or in the middle of next year' s first term obviously takes on great importance
Not so much because the issues are new - some of them were included in the last IGC and not resolved - but certainly because of the complexity and
With the argument for enlargement , the realisation of which does not present us with any fundamental problems , but which we do not envisage being achieved without consequences at various levels
This means giving up unanimity and extending decision making by qualified majority to new areas; it means a new weighting of votes in Council decision making by qualified majority;
and it means changing the composition and functioning of the institutions in terms of the number of Commissioners , the Council Presidency , the composition of the EP or even the choice
These are , in fact , changes that essentially target issues of power and influence within the EU and , where possible , aim to make viable or consolidate political boards of management
The marginal role that , in this context , it is sought to give to smaller , less developed countries causes us , naturally , to take a very reserved position , one of concern and
Our position is further reinforced by the solutions sought by some people in the area of security and defence and which aim for a militarisation of the EU , which

- (SV) We should like to emphasise that introducing a system for comparing asylum seekers' fingerprints is not in itself a guarantee of achieving the humane and generous asylum
In order to achieve an asylum policy of this kind , other measures and far-reaching efforts are required to further agreement between the Member States on the need for a

We have noted with great satisfaction that , at the meeting in the Council (legal and home affairs) on 29 October 1999 , the Danish government announced that it would participate
(PT) With the argument that we need to simplify the implementation of the Dublin Convention , the Council is trying to revive previous attempts to restrict the fundamental rights of
citizens of non-EU countries by means of the creation of a mechanism for collecting fingerprints controlled by a central unit , which will cover not only refugees and asylum seekers but
But even with the minor amendments that have been approved by the European Parliament , including a minimum age limit of 18 years and a limit on the number of comparisons
As the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market states , in normal circumstances , fingerprints will only be allowed to be taken from criminals or from individuals suspected of having
Thus , the protection of the fundamental rights of the individuals concerned requires that we do not proceed with the creation of a central control system for personal data because , in
To make the situation worse , no measures for monitoring and protecting data are being proposed , which leaves open the question of how we can guarantee the implementation of effective sanctions
Next , because , at the insistence of the Socialist/ecologist/Communist government of my country , to my great shame , the regulation itself scandalously omits the filing of the fingerprints of illegal immigrants
In building the Europe of Brussels , Maastricht and Amsterdam , you have created an area of high insecurity where illegal immigrants , drugs , trafficking of many different kinds , and crime may

Thousands of these weapons are to be found on aircraft , on aircraft carriers and on land , ready for firing , despite the fact that there are no threats to use
The risk of nuclear war by mistake was one of the reasons for the Canberra Commission' s proposal that no nuclear weapons should any longer be held in readiness for
This view was promoted in particular by the man formerly responsible for the United States' strategic nuclear weapons , General Lee Butler , who himself literally had his finger on the
The second demand we made in order to reduce the risk of nuclear war was to the effect that all nuclear weapons should be separated from their weapon carriers so
Nuclear power too relies upon the commercial electricity network in order , for example , to maintain the supply of cooling water and to cool down the radioactive core and the spent
If only a part of this protective network is knocked out because of computer errors , an estimated 100 metric tons of heavy uranium core in the reactor will melt

These concerns , combined with the statements of our fellow Member on the subject of the reaction of the Japanese Government , and of other international bodies , inviting people to take

This motion for a resolution is a clear signal to the international community that , in spite of the fact that news about Timor has disappeared from the major European newspapers
and that it is no longer the leading item on the most important European television news broadcasts , the international community and the European Union must continue to be attentive to
Firstly , because abuses of the human dignity and of the human rights of the Timorese who are refugees in other parts of Timor , particularly in West Timor , and who want
Secondly , there must be greater vigilance by the peacekeeping forces at the border so that those Timorese who do have the right to return to West Timor can do so
On the other hand , those responsible for the massacres and for the attacks on human life must be punished , not just to ensure that justice is done in Timor ,
but , indeed , to set an example for other parts of the world where , sadly , attacks on dignity and , above all , on life , which we feel is an inalienable right , still
Finally , Mr President , our intention is for the Commission and the Council to match the condemnations and political speeches with an appropriate expression of financial and technical support for the
With regard to the situation in East Timor we really need to put as much pressure as possible on the Indonesian authorities , because they seem to be turning a

Since then , some countries have woken up to the fact that they can no longer stand by idly and watch Indonesia with the support of the militia organisations in
In spite of the positive measures that were taken following Parliament' s resolution on September 16 last , specifically the entry of the international peace and security force under the
auspices of the UN and INTERFET , the humanitarian safety situation remains serious both in East Timor itself , which it is essential to provide with resources to support reconstruction , and for
Therefore , it is crucial that the European Union , the Member States and the whole international community maintain firm pressure on the Indonesian authorities so that they disarm and control the
so-called "militias" with the utmost urgency and they create the necessary conditions of safety for the refugees to return to East Timor , whose territorial integrity should be respected in its
And as approval of the budgetary line for the next few years has been positive , it is vital that the necessary sums be provided for economic and financial support
This means respecting its sovereignty , so decisions on its present and its future must be taken in close collaboration with the National Council for Timorese Resistance , as it is
Therefore this is an appeal for all Member States , the institutions of the European Union and the whole international community to keep support for the people of East Timor on
The situation of delay , made worse by the vindictive destruction perpetrated by the Indonesian armed forces , the small size of the territory together with the fact that there is
another half to the island , the coexistence with neighbours and powerful interests and the lack of an administration are all factors that contribute to the complexity of the task and
We must build basic infrastructures , establish bases for production , install an administration where none currently exists and do so taking into account the will and the involvement of the
With regard to international solidarity , it is clear that the joint assessment mission , coordinated by the World Bank and in which elements of the Commission participated , has finished its work

In line with this desire , when , at first reading , we took a stand on Budget 2000 , we established a specific point of a multiannual nature with EUR 30 million
In conclusion , I would like to highlight the tragic situation of the 250 thousand refugees outside East Timor: the whereabouts of several dozen thousands of people is not known and
The situation is intolerable and is affecting a third of East Timor' s population , which has the right to a free and informed choice as to whether they stay
Mr President , on behalf of my group , the Union for a Europe of Nations , I would like to state that I am one of the authors of this report and
There is no doubt at all that there are still many problems , both in the area of humanitarian aid and in that of support for reconstruction , and also because we
are still seeing serious violations of human rights , particularly in West Timor , with the activity of the militias which have prevented the refugees from East Timor regrouping and returning to
These are the reasons that lead me to agree wholeheartedly with this resolution , and also even to highlight again the need for there to be a specific investigation into who
I would also like to highlight the proposal that has been made to send a new delegation from the European Parliament to East Timor precisely to verify in loco
how this process of reconstruction is taking place and being handled , and in order to have all the necessary facts to enable us to continue maintaining East Timor as an

Mr President , I would like to tell you briefly that I belong to a generation which was fortunate not to live through the massacre of Algerians in Paris in 1961 ,
not to experience , on 9 November 1938 , Kristallnacht or the start of Jewish persecution in various European countries and fortunate , above , all to see the end of apartheid in South

China , the self-styled democratic Republic of the Congo , the United States and Iran have the sad record of coming at the top of the list of the countries which
In these countries , the right of life or death over prisoners is all the more intolerable in the light of the ridiculously limited budgets allocated to crime prevention policies
There is absolutely no doubt that the seventeen years that Mumia Abu-Jamal has just spent rotting on death row following a travesty of justice are linked to the fact
that he is black , to his fight against institutional racism , to the freedom of thought which this journalist practised by having the courage to denounce the corruption prevailing in the
It is important that European businesses should refuse to invest in the states of the United States or anywhere else in the world where the death penalty continues to
The Member States of the European Union must refuse to extradite any person to a country where it is known that their death sentence is automatically programmed as soon

Mr President , the events that led up to the withdrawal of the motion on the moratorium are described and evaluated , in the resolution we are preparing to vote on , in
I am afraid that the reasons behind the withdrawal of this resolution are , at the very least , suspect , and have more to do with a kind of boycott than the
I truly hope that Parliament will be attentive to this subject , because it is clear that the attitude of some of the Member States has been ambiguous , to say
As the Group of the Greens , we have taken note of these events , as well as the somewhat half-hearted wording of this resolution , which , however , we consider it important to
Nevertheless , I would stress once again that , from this point of view , the European Union' s ambiguity is apparent to everyone , and I therefore think that we should express
Despite what our colleague has just said , I think that on this occasion there is more than sufficient reason to congratulate ourselves on the fact that the European Union
What I would like to say , Mr President , is that we have done this because we are convinced that everybody has the unalienable right to the respect for life and
We have all seen the horrendous pictures of the last death sentence passed by the Florida Court and it will therefore not surprise any of you that the first
person to appear in the text of the joint resolution should be the Spanish - and hence European Union - citizen , Joaqu√≠n Jos√© Mart√≠nez , whose sentence we ask to be
In this case there has been a series of coincidences which have inspired an enthusiastic solidarity movement in our country in which the Government , all the political parties and the
However , Mr President , what is serious - and his case is serious enough as it is - are not the conditions of this trial , nor the fact that the
I therefore believe , Mr President , that as a European Parliament we have to show , in this and all other similar cases , a firm and resolute commitment to the right
It is founded upon an Old Testament "eye for an eye , tooth for a tooth" mindset which is not worthy of humanity now that we are approaching a new
But what the resolution really ought to be concerned with - a subject which my colleagues too have taken up - is the memorandum concerning the death penalty throughout
We would encourage the Commission and the Council to pursue this issue vigorously and to unite the European Union in unanimously condemning the death penalty in every forum so
The abolition of the death penalty would be a fantastic step forward in the fight for human rights and also a big step forward for the recognition of human
According to a report released recently , since 1973 and in the United States alone , 75 prisoners condemned to death were released when it was discovered that they had been
According to Amnesty International , for every six prisoners executed since the restoration of the death penalty in the United States , one innocent person was condemned to death and later
Therefore , it seems to me that the Council' s proposal to the United Nations , however important and positive the initiative may be , is very timid because calls on those States
That is why we ask the Council , in section 9 of this resolution , in the negotiations with third countries , to examine the possibility of incorporating the abolition of the

It seems to us an enormous and terrifying cruelty that anybody should consider executing ill people of this type and that people should be kept in prison for 21
Mr President , I am in complete agreement with Mrs D√≠ez Gonz√°lez on the need to seek to convince the Council to introduce a clause on capital punishment and the abolition
The problem clearly , therefore , lies in the lack of political will , and we can imagine the reasons for this: pressure from some major countries , such as the People' s
It is no longer possible for this dossier to be placed in the hands of presidencies which , as we know , change over every six months; we need a permanent
spokesman who can , on his own authority , organise the work of the various Member State delegations in New York so that , next year , we have a position which is consistent
from beginning to end , thus avoiding this truly tragic situation , one that has made things difficult for a number of third countries friendly to the European Union , starting with Mexico ,
We must therefore amend today' s motion for a resolution in order to firmly condemn the Council and ask it , as firmly , to entrust this dossier to Mr Solana ,
Mr President , Parliament has today , for the umpteenth time , expressed its repugnance of the anachronistic , anti-democratic methods of punishment of dubious efficacy which continue to be used throughout the world ,
However , even underage children are executed in the USA and , according to statistics , the criminal justice system operates selectively at the expense of the weakest economic and social groups ,
And while all this is going on , the 54th General Assembly of the UN has rejected the motion by the Finnish Presidency of the Council of the European Union
On the contrary , the death penalty is the preferred weapon of totalitarian regimes because it is a symbol of the power of the state and of the humility of
This is why , on the basis of our European values and in the name of respect for human rights , we call on the governments of all the countries in which
We also call on the USA to allow a retrial of the journalist Abu Jamal in Pennsylvania , of Mart√≠nez in Florida and of Robinson so that they may have

I shall vote in favour of the resolution asking for a moratorium on capital punishment , since it is the best on offer , but I consider that not having the courage
Among the many cases of death sentences where the sentence is so unfair that carrying out the sentence would be a heinous act , I wish to draw attention to the
And if these sentences show the worth of the regime of oppression and terror which is that of Iran , they are just as indicative of the essence and worth
It also shows the worth of the pronouncements on human rights by Europe' s Heads of State and Government who received the President of Iran with great pomp and
Finally , while I am delighted to see that Mumia Abu-Jamal , the victim of the schemes of a corrupt and racist police force , was not executed , I consider that the fight

The outrages committed against KFOR personnel are also unacceptable and , on behalf of my Group (the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party) , I should like strongly
I should also like to appeal to all parties to cease committing such outrages and to lay down their weapons and together embark upon the long and difficult road
Mr President , it is an insult to our conscience and political ethics that , after the military intervention by NATO and the European Union against Yugoslavia , under a humanitarian flag , as
a result of the unforgivable ethnic cleansing by Yugoslavia against the Albanians , we are now remaining calm and accepting the violence against the Serbs , gypsies and other minorities , this time
Therefore , we think that , if the European Union does not condemn and put an end to this criminal behaviour , the conclusions would be clear: firstly , the European Union would become
an accomplice in the killings of Serbs and gypsies organised by the criminal and mafia groups of the KLA; and secondly , it would demonstrate that the West has two different
Mr President , at the beginning of this year , anyone who was no longer able to stand by and watch the murders , expulsions , looting and pillaging by the Serbian army and
militia in Kosovo and for that reason spoke out in favour of so-called humanitarian intervention , must now wonder whether the war - that was unfortunately not waged against those who
committed the crimes , but against the Yugoslavian population , - the war that we conducted for over two and a half months and that cost several billion euros , really brought about
Secondly , it is no longer the Yugoslavian army in Kosovo , but our armies , which on the one hand are completing a fantastic undertaking in reconstruction , in protecting people , bringing
law and order , in every respect and on the other hand are despairing because they are not able to really protect the people that they should protect and that they
The former KLA - I say "former" because it supposedly no longer exists , because it was supposedly disarmed - believes that it has won a war and that it
We would assure the UN representative , Mr Kouchner , and his former colleagues , of our full support , if he would finally begin to set up an administration in Kosovo and
not leave that to the bogus and illegitimate government of the KLA , even if the local authorities and the city and local councils were not formed by the KLA , but
The reason is simply that we only concentrate on economic aid and forget the crucial things , that is to say , the practise of tolerance , the practise of democracy and
Mr President , the situation in Kosovo is marked by great uncertainty and violence and even by murder from time to time and in the end , as we have heard , that
Over eight years of an apartheid regime in Kosovo the Albanians did not do anything to anyone , neither to the Serbs nor to the Roma , nor to the Croats , nor
We must therefore ensure that in the communities where there is persecution , even the reconstruction be suspended , so that every single citizen in this country takes responsibility himself and
KFOR cannot be everywhere , it cannot stand behind everyone and so every decent Albanian - and there are more of them than we think - really must feel that
The problem is also that the Albanian leaders or those people who think they are , are not really in a position jointly to build the future for this land , for
Secondly , at local level , we need really responsible people and if these people cannot be Albanians or Serbs where they are in the majority , then it must be someone from
Now - this is of course a difficult task which must be carried out by UNMIG - the problem is that this is something that is easier to solve on
We must do that , but the first need is to create jobs , we must create infrastructure , so that the young people who are now going around with Kalashnikovs , can
Then we shall be on the right path and Mr Kouchner must also be a little more effective than he is at the moment , whoever may be hampering him
We are ourselves to blame , at least those who held this attitude , for the fact that Rugova was frozen out , because he was left alone for 10 years with
It is quite clear that in a desperate situation , in which hundreds of thousands of people were driven out by systematic state violence - and that is the big
We should for a start see clearly that condemning others can be a good thing , but it would also be a good thing to exercise some self-criticism: We have above
We therefore have a duty to stop every expulsion , including those in Kosovo , and we have a duty to speak up so that the ban on expulsions and the
Mr President , the fact is , and I can only endorse what my colleagues have just said , that we are running a considerable risk of missing the goal and failing to
In this very House , Mrs Pack and many others including myself have for years pointed out what could happen in Kosovo if we continue to look on and thereby
When we were in Kosovo a short while ago - the President of this House and Mrs Pack - , we saw that where "ethnic cleansing" occurred , the situation is going
It is unacceptable that if Serbs or Albanians need to go to hospital , they actually run a risk of being more injured once they get there than they would
It is unacceptable that every Albanian who has a liberal , open attitude , like the former speaker of the delegation at Rambouillet , is threatened because he speaks out in favour
As was already mentioned , it also has to do with the fact that we unfortunately have Albanian politicians in Kosovo who do not conduct policy that is geared to the
It was the speaker of the delegation in Rambouillet who made a great impression on us when he said: "Ask an Albanian politician any minor date , any minor event
But it must also examine very carefully who it is and then it must become clear and unambiguous that it is the UN that is also at stake along
With great sadness , I say , since all we are doing today is observing the results of our on-going hypocrisy in the case of Kosovo , not to say our blindness
Hypocrisy , since we were well aware that in opting for warfare last spring , that is to say , turning our backs on balance , the only condition for peace between the
By stirring up the entire planet in support of a gang of terrorists , the KLA , which was , unfortunately , supported for a long time by one of our Member States , since
We were well aware that our activism had nothing , indeed , to do with human rights , since it promoted chain reactions of terror , to the point where henceforth , we are
We are sorry to have to be reminding you of these obvious facts , but Europe has lost sight of the national principle to the extent that it is necessary
A nation goes beyond ethnic groupings , forming a pluralist body which erases the primary membership of a racial or family group , or at least relegates this to the private
Let us destroy nations , and what the Yugoslav association may have become in time , especially if Europe had opened its arms to it earlier , let us destroy nations , and
Because Europeans went into this war , as we well know , only out of weakness in its attitude to the United States , that is to say , to an empire which
So we can no longer do anything but look upon , Mrs Pack , the ruins which are only the initial results , alas , of a federal vision of the Europe which , starting
with the proud foundation of Serbia , a country that so often distinguished itself valiantly in history , is slowly leading the peoples of Europe to disorder , discord and , I say again ,
After all , they do not have one , not a dignified one that is , "wedged between Albanian terror in Kosovo , dislike and discrimination within other countries and dwindling humanitarian aid
One of the essential components of the Northern dimension that was decided on in Helsinki is the issue of cleaning the Arctic Ocean and averting the danger that could
We must therefore intervene more forcefully here so that Alexander Nikitin can finally be released and so that the accusations are dropped , because we all know that these proceedings
It is therefore necessary for the EU Mission in Moscow at least to observe this case , but also to intervene in the political dialogue , so that it is declared
Mr President , the European Convention on Human Rights that also applies to Russia as a Member State of the Council of Europe , has , as it were , its headquarters here in
That means that what is happening in Russia is not an internal affair of a far-off land but that it is an internal affair of a European institution at
We , as the EU , are also bound under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement , which not only commits Russia but ourselves too and it contains a human rights clause , to
speak out most fervently on behalf of Mr Nikitin for an improvement in his conditions of detention on the spot , for his release and as I said , for fair and
This is an extreme sanction and this House and the European institutions should send a very powerful message to Russia that it should re-think this issue , the charges should
In the context of the earlier debate on ending the death penalty , it is very relevant that we should call upon the Russian authorities to respect our views , the views
Firstly , as regards the matter of capital punishment , I would like to devote a few words not to the substance of the question , which you deal with in your draft
Indeed , as far as we are concerned , the abolition of capital punishment is an intrinsic part of our human rights policy , whereas for many countries this is exclusively a
In fact , we felt that some of the many amendments submitted by the countries for whom our position is a problem are , in our view , unacceptable , particularly the amendment
to introduce into the resolution a reference to article 2 , paragraph 7 of the United Nations Charter , in the terms of which , "Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorise
As far as we were concerned , the inclusion in the resolution of a reference specific to the principle of sovereignty of states would have entailed a risk of challenging
the body of legislation in the system of the United Nations , and , in particular , of the World Conference of 1993 , which said that the promotion and protection of human rights
It was not therefore , as I have heard , in order to yield to some sort of pressure that we preferred to close the debate in this way , at least
You must not , therefore , see this decision as indicative of a lack of a foreign policy , or that we caved under pressure , but of the Union' s assessment of
I believe that the Commission and , with it , the entire European Union has made it clear , from the start , that we condemn any sort of ethnic violence , regardless of
Thanks to programmes of assistance in democratisation and human rights , the Commission continues to provide support for measures intended to re-establish confidence and to promote dialogue between the different
We were already active in this way , without much success , unfortunately , even before the conflict , and I share , from this point of view , the suggestions that some of you
In addition , we support fully and absolutely the action undertaken by MINUK in order to set up an operational civil administration , capable of taking on the police functions which
MINUK approached the Commission with regard to the financing of the Kosovo protection force and the Member States shall take a decision , in the weeks to come , regarding the
In this context , we are asking all people of goodwill in Kosovo and outside , to also work towards these objectives in order to help us to ensure that MINUK
And if I may switch to English for convenience without breaching the rules of this House , I will answer that the European Commission has been following very closely and with
Representatives of EU Member States attended the court session in St Petersburg in October 1998 and were present when the Supreme Court delivered its latest decision in February 1999
In line with previous statements , the European Commission has made it clear that any further judicial proceedings regarding the contribution made by Mr Nikitin to the Bellona report should be
I am aware that Mr Nikitin's lawyers have lodged an application to the European Court of Human Rights and I am certain the Council of Europe's institutions will pursue
While respecting the judicial procedures of a sovereign country , the European Commission will remain vigilant to ensure that Mr Nikitin is granted an impartial and public trial based on the
Would the European Union be prepared , Mr Lamy , to play a role in this regard , in order to , in future , prevent this type of blunder which is catastrophic in the
Finally , being particularly attentive , of course , to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda , so that the duty to remember this conflict which already seems far off , some people think too
A people that has today been truly betrayed by the release of Jean Bosco Barayagwiza , who was , need one be reminded , the founder of hate radio , the notorious Radio-T√©l√©vision
The reaction of the Kigali authorities is understandable , but I invite them to resume their cooperation with the ICTR which is still , in spite of everything , the best instrument
It is essential for the international justice system to regain control if it wishes to ensure its own credibility , but we must also give it the resources it needs to
Mr President , we visited Nassau in the capacity of MEPs together with some colleagues from the ACP countries and two days prior to our visit , Saskia von Meyenfeldt , a UNICEF
Well , in this resolution , we mention an independent inquiry , and this enables us to make it clear that we would like not just the parties involved , so not just the
Sometimes it is good to quote these figures , because in the light of what is happening on our doorstep in Kosovo , we sometimes forget that a conflict of such
It remains an urgent requirement to promote a stability pact using all contacts we have through the European Commission' s links with the United Nations and to promote the political
I hope we succeed in sending out a clear message from within Europe that human rights cannot and should not be split up , and that we do not only attach
Today , indeed , we can only be outraged at the release of Jean Bosco Barayagwiza , supposedly for technical reasons , even though he was one of the most significant parties in
His release , indeed , is quite symptomatic of the lack of will to make an evaluation of the genocide and , more especially , of the wish to hush up the involvement
Let us also stress that the Rwandan situation , as worrying as it is , more particularly affects the stability of neighbouring countries , and the situation in the Congo is quite tragic
It is essential today for the European Parliament to assert clearly that , in order to ensure stability in this region , the conditions must be created for a peace which is
Without some action of this sort , the populations of Rwanda are likely to feel they have been wronged and ethnic conflict is likely to start up again with renewed
This week , I heard the advisor of the Council , the High Representative for the common foreign and security policy , and I hope that we will be able , at some
Mr President , Commissioner and Colleagues , as someone who has worked in and known Rwanda since 1984 , as someone born in Tanzania where I lived for many years , as someone speaking
The International Criminal Tribunal in Arusha must do its work efficiently , and we hope that those doing this work will take measures to bring this process to a just
We need to evaluate the work of the tribunal to identify the weaknesses so that we can furnish appropriate assistance to ensure high standards of justice without wasting time
The innocent victims of genocide and conflict cannot wait for ever to rebuild their lives in order to live in peace in their own villages and in their own
They need to cooperate fully with the EU special envoy , the EU , the United Nations , the OAU and all humanitarian aid agencies in doing what is needed to support
Because the Member States apparently cannot agree on how to tackle the crisis in the Great Lakes Region , we leave Burundi to African countries , some of which are involved
We link our aid to the Arusha peace process where Tanzania acts as mediator but at the same time condone the fact that rebels carry out attacks on Burundi
Mr President , of the great number of problems affecting Rwanda and Burundi I should like on behalf of my Group to speak about the latest events , that is say , what
We took some pride in the fact that this Tribunal was set up at all - with our assistance too - whether it was adequate is a more complicated matter
We cannot understand - and I express myself carefully here - that the presumed architect of the genocide , Barayagwiza , on the basis of procedural issues - and this is
He was , after all , the political director in the foreign ministry of a regime that was responsible for the deaths of 800 000 people - we should really say
This person , who has now been released , was a leading official in the state radio at the very time when the radio was urging and inciting people on to
As far as Rwanda is concerned , the Commission shares the concerns which have been expressed regarding the effectiveness of the system of justice , if I may use this diplomatic term ,
To answer Mrs Ries , regarding the Rwandan national system of justice , the Commission targeted its interventions at institutional support to the government departments in the area of reinforcement of defence
rights and civil cases , in the area of improving living standards in prisons and in the area of support for the survivors of genocide , as well as in the area
It is working on defining a system of courts of arbitration along the lines of traditional practice , where the courts are made up of citizens elected to the various
levels of local administration , and they would be established to judge three categories of defendant: firstly , ordinary murderers , secondly , those who assaulted but did not kill , and thirdly , finally , the
looters , leaving the instigators and ideologists of the genocide and massacres to be judged effectively by ordinary courts , which must be organised in some way to be able to take
This evaluation will include support for the International Criminal Tribunal and its conclusions will enable us to identify any new support according to the methods we shall assess in
We have supported the peace process by financing the talks taking place in Arusha , with a contribution of EUR 2 million , which is far from being the largest contribution and
The intensification of the confrontations , in recent months , has given rise to the displacement of some tens of thousands of people who have , in effect , as has been mentioned in
We intervened immediately to provide humanitarian aid , with aid of more than EUR one million over three operations , and we are prepared to continue to intervene in order to
At a meeting in New York at the start of the year , the backers of Burundi decided to contribute towards improving the living conditions of the most vulnerable sectors
We feel that the complete resumption of cooperation is linked to the results of the peace process , and to the establishment of a political and constitutional framework which will
I trust that the Portuguese Presidency will use its renowned skills and experience to develop European Union appreciation of the problems that confront Pakistan and I would welcome Mr Lamy's
Mr President , the military coup that took place in Pakistan in October immediately after the army Chief-of-Staff , General Musharraf was stood down is condemned in the strongest possible terms by
Even if the take-over of power by the military occurred without great protests from the population , there is no alternative to a properly functioning democracy brought about by free
The attempt to prove that the former Prime Minister Mr Sharif had participated in a criminal conspiracy and had built up a system of nepotism , should not become a
There is therefore no reason why the EU should be prepared to follow other states , which think that the stability programme that has been announced has a good chance
The first signs are quite hopeful: the assurance of a climate favourable to investment , tax relief , the thinning out of the bureaucracy and the ending of the personal enrichment
The suspension of both Commonwealth membership and the European Union Cooperation Agreement can only be reversed when all the conditions for the urgently needed economic , social and humanitarian reforms
For decades elected , but altogether corrupt governments and most recently that of Mr Nawaz Sharif , have allowed violations of human rights , slave labour , social disasters and a foreign debt
The same governments supported the fundamentalist murderous regime of the Taliban in Afghanistan and represent a constant incalculable risk to peace in the region because they support and stir up
We condemn most strongly the military coup in Pakistan and urge those in power to restore the rule of law and constitutional order immediately by setting up a civil
The EU as a whole must adopt an unambiguous position towards Pakistan , which stresses that for us , democratic principles can neither be negotiable nor the subject of compromises and
I too like many colleagues was interested in the response of many people of Pakistani origin and background to this coup - people who are themselves involved in democratic politics
So that reaction adds weight to our awareness of much that was wrong under the previous regime , for example the lack of protection for the rights of religious minorities
We believe that the conduct of the trial of the former prime minister will also be a clear sign as to the military's good intentions to return to , or
The Union , and I believe this is clear to everyone , is extremely concerned at this coup d' √©tat and fervently hopes for the restoration of democracy in the near
The Council is waiting to see that the assurances given by the interim administration , as it is called , relating to respect for human rights and civil liberties , are respected
As regards the specific points you have raised in the resolutions relating to the Commission' s development aid programmes and projects in Pakistan , it must be stressed that these are
Many of these projects are implemented by NGOs and are intended to improve the scope and quality of social sector services , particularly in the fields of primary education and
We are perfectly aware of the deplorable situation of a great many children in Pakistan , especially girls , but we feel that the most effective means of improving this situation
We acknowledge the need to assist the NGOs and civilian sector associations in order to strengthen the democratic institutions of the country , and you doubtless know that the capacity
In addition , we have established contact with several NGOs and associations , but we feel that care must be taken not to overload these organisations with funds and assistance , which
In order to reply specifically to Mr Duff' s question , following the coup d' √©tat , the Union cancelled the signing of the new cooperation agreement between the Community and Pakistan ,
and we suspended our political dialogue so as to send a message , loud and clear , to the new masters in Pakistan regarding our concerns about the coup d' √©tat and
I should just like to say that in principle of course I was in favour of this resolution , but that I do feel that something very dangerous has been started
We should take this Charter of Fundamental Rights so seriously that we prepare it with a considerable , almost constitutional majority here in the House by consensus and not by
I believe that this Charter on Fundamental Rights must be discussed carefully and that it should not detach the rights of the child from the parents' rights , the rights
- (FR) At this time when we are about to vote on the resolution on the rights of the child , I wish to declare the importance which I attach
It reminds me of my motive for taking up politics , which may be summed up as follows: to improve , as far as may be possible , the daily lot of
And even though I know that this vote will not radically change the tragic situation of thousands of children here or elsewhere , it does testify to the political will of
Declaring that it is intolerable for children to be forced to go to work instead of to school , for children not to be able to eat their fill , for children
to be sold as if they were marketable goods , for children to be the victims of adult physical or moral violence , already represents a great step forward , one which must
The aims of the Convention account for the unprecedented international reaction: measures to be implemented in international law to protect the rights of the most innocent , most vulnerable of
The state , in its attempt to provide a legal basis for the protection and treatment of children must bow to the pre-eminent right which parents have in protecting , raising
We must ensure that the family , to quote the Convention on the Rights of the Child , is 'afforded the necessary protection and assistance so that it can fully assume
The preamble to the Convention states that the child , in order to realise 'the full and harmonious development of his or her personality , should grow up in a family
It is in families that children learn the values of 'peace , dignity , tolerance , freedom , equality and solidarity' (preamble) , as well as the skills necessary to implement these values in
The Convention on the Rights of the Child recognises the responsibilities of parents in providing the proper care and attention to their children , as well as the child's right to
I am happy to support the motion on the floor today which will ensure that these rights are supported - the rights of parents to raise their children , and
Mr President , those of us who represent the Stateless nations of Europe passionately denounce the latest aggression which , at this turn of the century , is being committed by the Russian
All of this because a new Rasputin wants to gain popularity in Russia and take power as a new President , and to this end he thinks nothing of seriously
Mr President , this resolution on Chechnya is the most far-reaching there has ever been at international level and that is a credit to this House , for in the first war
However , I am disappointed that our amendment , which on the basis of the human rights clause in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement of this agreement will be placed on
I have the impression that we need much stricter measures than in the resolution we have so far shown to arrive at a cease-fire at all and to ensure
I believe that today at the OSCE meeting - this subject is being discussed at the same time over in Istanbul - , it is necessary for there to be a
real possibility that will lead to peace negotiations , for the problem in the Caucasus cannot be resolved in the way the Russians want and I therefore feel it is very
important for us not to just stand still , but that in particular the Commission also takes up this appeal and threatens to take action such as freezing new TACIS agreements
The Russian army is chiefly making attacks on the civilian population , an increasing proportion of whom are being forced to flee to neighbouring regions , only to be packed together
At a time when the transition to a capitalist economy is having the effect of causing a fall in production levels and the considerable impoverishment of the majority of
We denounce the Russian leaders who are responsible for this war , but we also denounce the leaders of the Western world who make do with a mild reproach , while supporting
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report (A5-0063/1999) by Ms Giannakou-Koutsikou , on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs ,
Mr President , first of all let me thank Marietta Giannakou most warmly because she has opened up the opportunity today by means of an exchange , to deal with the vote
First , we are dealing with the drug trade that in the meantime represents 8% of the volume of trade and makes billions in profits at the expense of young
As far as the consumption of drugs is concerned , it is a fact that as many as 5 million young people take synthetic drugs and some 20% have tried
These are ambitious goals , but in reality it will not be easy , as up to now it has not been possible to obtain comparable data for individual Member States and
to compare the methods and as long as we do not have this comparison of methods and dates it will also not be possible to achieve 'best practice' as a
I can see that there is quite a good chance of us attempting on a voluntary basis to declare schools as drug-free areas , to make it clear to schoolchildren
Secondly , we must urge the Member States most emphatically that we should finally obtain a standardised system of data and method registration so that it is possible to find the
best models in the battle against drugs We must encourage cooperation between the police and the judiciary in the countries of Europe in the battle against drug crime and to
It is , however , a matter of getting to work on turning this programme into action in the battle against drugs and for young people and for a drug-free society
Mr President , we would have liked the debate and the vote on this report not to have to take place today because - and I should like to say this
right at the beginning - owing to the circumstances that led to the agenda being amended today and because of the fact that the voting time took so long because
I venture to make this comment because it is a glaring contradiction to the other assertion that Mrs Giannakou' s report is so important and it should therefore absolutely
In fact , our colleague' s report is an important report and must be discussed very carefully , among other reasons because the debate on the report has once again shown that
I believe that Mrs Giannakou has taken a lot of trouble to give an opinion on the action plan in a form that was geared to a consensus and
was determined in such a way as to integrate the different ways of looking at the situation that not only go right through the political "families" but are also characterised
I will say on behalf of my absent colleague Jan Andersson , who as a Swedish Member of Parliament - I shall speak about that again in a minute - was
in a very difficult position , because Sweden is one of the Member States that has a very special approach to drugs policy , owing to its national experience and national tradition
and which despite this I believe , as you do , Mrs Giannakou , with the compromise amendments have ensured that this report is actually structured in such a way that it will
128 amendments were submitted and you finally formulated 17 or 18 compromise amendments that should help to focus this profusion of amendments so that in the end a logical and
Firstly , all of us , whether on the right or left of this House must be clear and I do believe that the approach to drug policy must start from one
Because the way in which we help these people to reintegrate into society , the way in which we reduce their personal , individual suffering must derive from specific regional , local
So there cannot be an officially prescribed European drugs policy but there must be a European framework within which help can be provided to the people affected who are
The second aspect is that in our drugs policy we must bear in mind that in hardly any other branch of crime in Europe is more money earned than in
That means that we can talk about reducing the supply , which is a very important factor but it still means that those people who supply drugs on the market
Everywhere we succeed in preventing illegal income from drug dealing from being converted into legal income , we have made great progress , that is to say , the battle against the
Policy on combating drugs - I address this to the Commissioner for internal security - therefore means that by reducing the supply there will be the resulting prosecution of
The Dutch model which allows drug shops , which in the Netherlands are given the unfortunate English term "coffee shops" , presupposes a division between soft drugs , namely marihuana , and
These two groups , the followers of the Swedish model and those of the Dutch model , do not want too much European cooperation in this field because they fear that their
Alongside these two groups , there is a third trend represented in this Parliament , namely those who do advocate more extensive and intensive European cooperation in the drugs policy , so
This means that countries like France and Germany should do more to treat their drug addicts but that a country like the Netherlands , for example , should focus on controlling
But it gives cause for hope that bad practices can be compared on the basis of accurate data and that a humane and effective drugs policy will become a
Possibilities other than rehabilitation are still not mentioned in this report , although it is established practice in more and more Member States to supply drugs in a controlled manner , sometimes
We had no traffic from Third World countries , and nor did we have very much money so , even if the supply of drugs had been there , we would not ,
The fact which has to be faced is that the criminal forces which are involved in the manufacture and trading of drugs have a network , resources and powers which have
That is why there is a need for a Community policy for , in the situation in which the European Union finds itself , we must necessarily work together to combat
The report we have before us is quite excellent in what it says on a number of matters , and it points out with some clarity that , if we do not
Naturally , we all of us want to , and what we immediately think about in this connection is treatment , which is to say efforts involving a variety of social and
I am well aware that it affects people who feel isolated or who are in social need , but these in fact constitute only a few of the people who
What our problem today is , is that young people , who may have good home lives , at the same time feel that their lives are so empty that they need
I think it is dangerous for young people because it tempts them into believing - and I quote her - that "one can live with drugs , as is the
However , there is a crucial difference in the case of tobacco and alcohol because , in the vast majority of cases , it is possible for people to control their use
I therefore want to say that it is important that , in the work that is being done within the EU , we give a very central place to having an
information campaign for young people , who may today all too easily be enticed by friends of their own age and by others to try substances which are presented to them
So let us get away from this nonsense about decriminalisation and this tendency to trivialise the whole problem area by closing our eyes to the criminals who exploit our
My group is a keen participant in the work which has been taking place in the Committee , and I should like to thank Mrs Giannakou for the sterling work she
We do not consider that , with the report we have before us and with what it contains , the definitive and best outcome has been obtained , and we very much
Mr President , the report of the rapporteur , Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou , describing the Commission' s plan of action regarding drug control is a powerful document in which the European Parliament strongly opposes
He claimed that this clearly calls for coordination of policy , even legislative harmonisation within those countries which , on account of their diverging policy , are playing into the hands of
Alas , my country does not only have the dubious honour of being known as a transit country for drugs , it is now also building itself a reputation for producing
I would urge Mr Prodi to call a spade a spade; the Netherlands is one of those countries that play into the hands of the trade on account of
Mr President , as the rapporteur pointed out , the European Commission affirms that neither the regulatory instruments nor the programmes for the Action Plan on the fight against drugs 1995-1999 have
Given that we are talking about the fight against drugs , the Commission' s Communication is not included on the agenda of the Court of Auditors or even OLAF , but on
You will all agree - right as well as left - because when we discuss drugs you restrict yourselves to having simple differences of opinion , and no group is brave
Indeed , when drugs are under discussion , the vast majority of you renounce your role as a government Member who , when faced with a problem , takes a lead on the
You do not want to examine the possibility of changing the prohibitionist policy on drugs , because , when it comes to political choices , you impose moral convictions and beliefs which are
In short , on this subject , you prevent true , scientific , secular debate by choosing an ethical approach which proves to be frustrating , ineffective and disastrous: disastrous because you try to
You refuse to carry out a cost-efficiency assessment because you would have to admit that with your policy you have handed over control of the production and trade in
Thanks are due to all who have contributed to formulating it including , naturally enough on this particular day , the rapporteur Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou , but also Sir Jack Stewart-Clark who has
May I perhaps emphasise that it is rather striking that I in particular , as a Swede , am very impressed indeed by this Parliament' s ability to produce what I consider
There are features which will mean that we embark upon a common road towards fewer drugs and with the goal of leading both society and individuals away from drugs
Once these measures which are now being proposed have taken effect , I believe that there will emerge in the Member States a greater sympathetic understanding of the differences between their
We should , however , also like to be present when assessments of on-going projects are carried out so that we might see which road the European Union will continue to
If we do not want to comply with our legislation , we must change our legislation and not pursue some kind of policy which does not follow the rules of
Mr President , given the fact that there are so few of us left and given the concerns for tomorrow morning' s vote , we should perhaps think about the significance of
A hard-line approach on hard drugs , including XTC , is , at the same time , an effective way of lifting victims from the criminal circuit via a health-care approach and is
What we have before us is the product of a long and emotionally-laden process and we have not finished by a long way because we are about to vote
Until such time , until we have won this war and our society is free from drugs , we are conducting an uncompromising battle against not only the drugs Mafia but
The militarisation of these societies , together with the fact that these poor people are not being given any effective help , means there are no truly sustainable prospects for the
Are drugs really at least as important as human rights , as suggested by the rapporteur , and why do we not learn from an effective approach as adopted in the
Perhaps it is so that the call made to the Presidency for an inter-pillar council could be seen as signalling a new opportunity , because this document still feels like
I belong to a growing minority in the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party and also in this House which believes a radical change to our approach
Quite apart from the ethical flaw in the prohibitionist argument - the state has no right to prevent a responsible adult from taking drugs - the fact is that
It is filling our prisons with people who need care rather than incarceration , and it discriminates disproportionately against ethnic minorities , some of which have cultures in which drug abuse
Irrespective of the age group , country and drug concerned , drug taking is increasing or stagnating despite the harsh penalties and much greater number of prosecutions at national and increasingly
We cannot escape the conclusion that the very fact of this programme' s existence is all that matters , and that in fact it serves different aims to those that
Fourthly , city cooperation should be promoted , taken from the idea of the European Cities Drug Policy as a prime example of a project that recognises - legal and illegal
Two groups of people are attracted to these: adults who , because of the free market , are at the mercy of social insecurity and tension and young people who want
As far as I am concerned , Mr Prodi' s statement is actually an important reason why I would reject this proposal out of hand , despite all the balanced views
But I do not believe that in the name of efficiency , we can lay aside principles , and I shall start with such just such a matter of principle: we believe
They are a vice that weakens the will , which ensnares the individual in a dependency which enslaves and depersonalises him or her , which destroys social bonds and relationships , which
We know that drugs affect all countries and all social classes , and we also know that Europe' s enlargement towards the East dramatically shows the urgent need for efficient
According to the report by the European Monitoring Centre , cannabis is still the most widely consumed drug throughout the European Union , although it is heroin that causes the most
The same report , furthermore , shows an increase in the consumption in Europe of new synthetic drugs such as ecstasy , as well as an increase in the consumption of more traditional
In the area of treatment , we must give support to high-quality programmes aimed at the whole community , using educational methods , including those targeting the prison population , together with initiatives
With regard to reducing the availability of drugs , we must continue and increase our support to producing countries , so that they include in their priorities the reduction of demand and
This Parliament does not have the right to ask the Member States for greater commitment and greater investment in the fight against drugs if it does not lead by
We expect a great deal from its work , in terms of a better understanding of the phenomenon , in terms of the existence of data and comparable information , and , above
We must take decisions and release resources which correspond to the commitment that we claim to have in this vital fight against organised crime for the sake of human
I would like to congratulate Mrs Giannakou on her highly substantive report , especially the emphasis on international collaboration and the introduction of a systematic , yearly inter-pillar Council meeting to
In the light of the international agreement concluded by the Special Session of the United Nations Organisation in June 1998 for a balanced approach to the problem which aims to
The European Union action plan for the period from 2000 to 2004 must therefore include , over and above what is mentioned in the report , practices and programmes directed towards
Similarly , we need to focus our attention on and give priority funding to programmes to evaluate practices aimed at prevention , treatment and reintegration and in connection with the consequences to
Finally , I would like to point out that the European monitoring centre in Lisbon is carrying out important work and I trust that the information and data collected by
Mr President , I am speaking in place of my colleague , Mr Hern√°ndez Mollar and , on his behalf , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou on the excellent work
It is clear that the drug problem , not only on a European level but also on a world level , requires the special attention of politicians , institutions and the whole
On 26 October , in this Parliament , the President of Colombia , a country which unfortunately has strong links with the drug problem , told us: "Drug trafficking has been the great
And we are not talking here about an issue which only affects the Member States nor the European Union , but an issue which directly affects human beings in any
Our first concern in this Parliament should be to point out that the responsibility is collective , that it requires collaboration , cooperation and coordination between the judicial and penal authorities and
To this end , the European Parliament , in this resolution , has highlighted and strengthened the role which the European Observatory on Drugs and Drug Addiction must play by giving it
I would like particularly to stress the importance of the fight against traffickers who use and exploit illegal immigrants , especially on the Southern border of Europe , in Andalucia , Ceuta
If we add to this the considerable increase which has been observed in the consumption of alcohol by young people , which in many cases goes hand in hand with
Action in the field of education and families , economic cooperation with associations and NGOs , especially in the field of leisure and sport , will complement the actions which must banish
Both the Member States and the European Union itself must prioritise , in their budgets , the economic means which will allow the implementation of the measures proposed , including prevention , suppression
We need a multi-pronged policy , we need to act together to stop the growers and the traders and the pushers , but we also need policies on education and health
If we simply cut the supply and not the demand , then we will end up with a higher price for the drugs on the street and with more crime
We need role models from music and fashion and film to get the message across to young people: not just by saying "no" , that does not work , but by
I shall never forget , as a minister responsible for fighting drugs , going and meeting a young man who had lost his health and his friends and his relationships , his
But how much better if we could destroy this evil by persuading future generations of young people that it is simply not for them; it is simply not worth
Mr President , in my intervention I will attempt to summarise the opinions of my Italian colleagues , Mr Costa and Mr Nistic√≤ , too , who were previously down to speak , but are
At the same time , we must also initiate different types of relations between the Union as a whole and the activities of the individual states , and between the principle
of subsidiarity and the need - which has also , rightly , been expressed - for the Union to equip itself with a common policy on this phenomenon which is a real
I said that the report is excellent , not just because it rightly puts the two elements of the matter back into the spotlight - a combined action to reduce demand
and to reduce supply - but also , may I say , because of the frankness with which Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou criticises what is still insufficient in the Commission proposal , both from a
financial and economic point of view - we cannot state the importance of a battle and then not follow through in financial terms - and from the point of view ,
In conclusion , I would just like to emphasise two points that , in our experience as Italians , are particularly important and significant: firstly , the importance of supporting basic scientific research as
well so that we gain a greater understanding of the phenomenon , and , if possible , receive early warning of what the alleged drugs of the future will be , especially finding out
the devastating effects of synthetic drugs; secondly , the importance of involving in these actions those principally concerned , those who are in the front line every day , who help drug addicts ,
I think that , in future , when we address this subject again , it will be useful to come back to the point of who is managing and helping drug addicts
The next item is the report (A5-0050/1999) by Mr Newton Dunn on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs on the initiative of the
Now the history of this proposal is that in January of this year , the Commission put forward the same proposal and said its purpose was to detect documents brought in
The fact that the German Government has sought to avoid parliamentary scrutiny altogether by keeping this under the third pillar and the fact that the Finnish Presidency has not
even turned up to answer our questions either in committee or in plenary is , I am sorry to say , a great stain on the reputation of the Finns , who previously
To conclude , the committee has voted to change the legal base so that this matter comes back under the first pillar , because this proposal is primarily about detecting forged documents
I am asking everyone who is here to vote tomorrow morning to support the committee , to establish parliamentary control over this new area of policy , which is our remit
It is a system for registration and comparison and thus an instrument that also helps to combat illegal entry and illegal immigration or the committing of criminal acts under
If the figures are correct , then we have in the meantime learned that almost the same criminal earnings are obtained from smuggling as from drug crime and with considerably
I have been given access to figures that show that of the 400 ,000 to 500 ,000 illegal immigrants who come to the European Union every year , at least 200 ,000 are
That means that the aim should not be to run two parallel systems side by side , but to unite both of them in one system in the interests of
But we should try to be more efficient so that two systems do not run in parallel but are associated with each other so that something is achieved: so
We cannot allow ourselves the intellectual freedom to be afraid of a few poor creatures who sneak in with forged documents and at the same time guarantee serious criminals
The Legal Committee that has dealt with this matter was also unanimous and , I repeat , unanimous , in this opinion with all the other Groups after an in-depth examination and ,
Mr President , I too would like to support the substance of the German Council initiative to improve on the exchange of information on counterfeit travel documents and to strengthen the
security of the European Union's borders both for Member States such as my own , the United Kingdom , which are outside of Schengen as well as those that are at the

We in the UK are currently witnessing something of the order of 7 ,000 new applicants for asylum every month and over 80% of these eventually turn out after investigation
I personally have come across a Nigerian asylum seeker being granted asylum on the strength of a false Liberian passport , an Albanian family who passed themselves off as Kosovans , another
Nigerian who had loaned his British passport to his cousin who was able to enter the United Kingdom under the identity of his cousin and then commit a crime , and
We have a duty to remember that this constant flow of illegal immigration is posing an enormous burden , in particular in inner cities , on our national health service , social
Unfortunately , there is evidence that large numbers of asylum-seekers have been waved through Continental Europe with a suggestion that they head towards our Channel ports in the knowledge that
Although the British Conservative Party is formally opposed in principle to commissioning under Article 63 of the Treaty of Amsterdam to the first pillar of policies on visas , immigration and
asylum - and I therefore have to disagree with our rapporteur on this issue - nevertheless we welcome intergovernmental cooperation under the third pillar through Council joint action on the
There is evidence that organised crime has spotted a soft and lucrative target in the illegal traffic of human beings who are often prepared to spend their life savings to
This initiative is , therefore , in my view , a step in the right direction with the use of modern computer image digitalising technology to aid law enforcement agencies and interior
It is a good example in my view of the sort of European Union venture that my party in the United Kingdom can support so long as it is
The German government has taken an initiative to restrict and gain better control of the counterfeiting of travel documents - and that is in the context of the freedom
Mr Newton Dunn has now , on the pretext that the Parliament could not have such a strong influence under the third pillar as with his legal base , chosen the
approach to amend the legal base and in doing so he has limited the target group taken into consideration to those who are affected under the first pillar within the
The debate here shows that not all of our efforts bear fruit , because the government cooperation is not sufficient to convert the needs resulting from the internal market structure and
Because we are arguing here about the legal bases , we are conducting some stupid debates about illegal immigration - that is something for the Tory Party conference , but ineffective
for Europe - and we are completely neglecting what we should do , that is , create effective legislation to restrict the counterfeiting of documents , both by those who illegally provide access
Mr Newton Dunn , because we are of the view that in weighing up your proposal , that is a very worthy one , and the intention that the German Council Presidency had
in its time , we must decide in favour of the greater target area , we shall reject your amendment , not only because of the legal base , but as a consequence of

This is what has been happening for some time , and , with this new piece of news , I think that the pot will be heated even more so that even
In addition to the serious harm that they know they have to suffer , there is also the fact that , unfortunately , being elderly , they more than other people are more likely
to be the targets of the criminal acts which , throughout the European Community , are sadly being perpetrated by many people who illegally enter the Union and then commit them once
I would therefore like to say to my friends and fellow Members , Mr Gebhardt and Mr Schulz , that , firstly , in the amendments tabled by Mr Newton Dunn , the need to
I would also like to say that if these criminals do not enter illegally , then they will not commit crimes either; if , on the other hand , they are decent
It is precisely for this reason that we are saying that what this measure is doing is positive - even if it reminds us of Ars√®ne Lupin , the gentleman
I think that Parliament knows that , on this matter , it has long been the Commission' s intention that the battle against document fraud and the counterfeiting and abuse of travel
I would like to draw the Chamber' s attention , however , to the fact that , in this area , the conclusions of the Tampere European Council took a certain view of the
situation by appealing for the continuation of efforts seeking to implement an active common policy on visas and on combating the counterfeiting of documents in order to guarantee better management
But , of course , the fact that we prefer a legal basis which is based upon the first Pillar does not exclude the possibility of using this instrument in the battle
In any event , the Commission would like to say that , from our point of view , we agree with the rapporteur' s analysis , according to which , in the long term , this
I would therefore like to remind you that , at the time the FABO (Archiving and Image Exchange System) was adopted , the Commission , had already announced that it would take
For reasons of consistency and even to save resources , the Commission intends shortly to put forward proposals to this effect , that is , proposals that will seek the integration of
the exchange of counterfeit or falsified documents , the object of the present proposal , into a broader system of technical cooperation that will implement the exchange of information on all kinds
This more advanced system of technical cooperation will thus decisively contribute to citizens' safety and to the fight against organised crime , improving the monitoring of our external borders in terms
In this way , we will be creating conditions which will allow us to safeguard the security of the Union' s citizens , the monitoring of illegal immigration flows and also the

However , today and tomorrow I should like to be able to vote on the procedures of guarantees by the Community for the European Investment Bank , the EIB for short ,
It relates to the period up to the year 2003 under my proposal , to be precise until 31 January 2003 , then there will be a review half way through
The main problem area with which my report deals , which became clearer as I worked on the report , is that the European Investment Bank , as far as modern business
Some of the people I have spoken to have explained that the European Investment Bank is trailing some twenty years behind the World Bank as far as modern business management
Owing to the fact that its shareholders do not expect high interest rates and the thus possible low gearing rate , that is the ratio of the lending volume to
Despite this direct and indirect assistance to the Bank from the European Union , the EIB is keen to appear to the public as a quite ordinary bank and in the
The particular "constipation" of the EIB in matters of public monitoring and transparency even led the ECOFIN Council on 8 August 1999 to state the following , and I quote:
"In view of the important financial task assigned to the European Investment Bank by the Treaty and a series of Community regulations , it must take an exemplary attitude to fraud
The Council does not doubt that the governing body of the Bank will shortly submit a proposal to their board of governors for a decision in accordance with the
This mistrust is increased further by its dealings to date with Mr Blak , the rapporteur of the Committee on Budgetary Control , who has been waiting for a long time
I should like once again to thank the Committee on Budgetary Control for its preparatory work in this regard , which has allowed me in the short time available to
In the future we shall also have to watch the development of the EIB with regard to more transparency and for all sceptics , it is also a matter of economic
Here , also , the Bank has been criticised in the past , both regarding its investments in the health sector in my own country , that particularly consolidate antiquated structures and in
It cannot and may not suffice in the future for the Bank to restrict itself to the isolated inspection of individual projects - such as , for example a section
of motorway - , it must also inspect the projects in context - for example within a transport development plan in a particular country , in order to be able to identify
My predecessor from the Socialist Group , Mr Freddy Blak , Mrs R√ºhle , the author of the report , many Members of Parliament and the Court of Auditors have all expressed their
I , as the new rapporteur for the Bank , requested Sir Brian Unwin , the President of the EIB , for an initial meeting to set out a framework to assess the

I have been told by Mr Mart√≠ , one of his vice-presidents , that the EIB is owned by the Member States and , as such , according to the Treaty , it is

Clearly there is support for this as Ecofin , in its meeting on 8 October in Tampere , reinforced its previous criticisms of the EIB's management and performance by directing it
I have seen the decision taken by the EIB concerning this directive and according to paragraphs 5 and 6 of the decision taken by the Bank it will not
Mr President , the succession of earthquakes that have wrought destruction on north-eastern Turkey have led us to consider it crucial to increase the sums allocated to that country , and therefore ,
we voted , on the first reading , in favour of a revision of the financial perspectives which include emergency support for Turkey on a par with the priority that we gave
In addition to this budgetary boost , it is also essential to strengthen support for Turkey by means of credit on favourable terms , and we therefore support the rate of
At the same time , it was with a certain amount of pleasure that we received the news , recently , that the European Investment Bank has finally accepted the scrutiny of its
In any event , we think that it is essential for the forthcoming revision of the Treaty to establish the European Investment Bank as an institution under the full control
of the Community , under the supervision of the Court of Auditors and the European Parliament , so that it does not merely answer to a general assembly of Member States , as
As soon as all the Bank' s activity is supported by a considerable Community budget effort , which guarantees the risks linked to banking activity , the scrutiny of its accounts must
When both Parliament and public opinion were surprised at information published in the press , according to which an institution that we thought was involved entirely in structural investments had
This is not a question of interfering in commercial lending policy , a matter which is the sole competence of the EIB' s management , but merely of guaranteeing respect for
The EIB is the trustee of a valuable Community inheritance , both from the point of view of the actions that it has helped to implement and from the point
This means that if the political situation in a country in which a project is to be carried out continues as predicted , there is only a financial risk attached
The percentage rate obviously has a bearing on how many loans can be guaranteed by a sum that is contained in the financial perspectives and which is at present
In practice , changing the rate may not have an effect except as a means of regulating the overall amount of loans , as the guarantees do not often have to
It is at least as much a question of in actual fact developing these countries' societies and economies so that they can manage the new environment they are to
The rapporteur and the Committee on Budgets particularly point out that the Bank' s projects must support important objectives , including the European Parliament' s decisions concerning , for example , the
We take a favourable view of the desire that now exists to carry out assessments in such a way that differentiation takes place on the basis of how risks
This is also important in order for us to be able to learn from the results of the Bank' s activities and use our analyses to develop activities in
In the Committee on Budgetary Control , we have fought a hard struggle over six years to obtain an insight into the Bank' s affairs and , yesterday , we finally got
I think , however , that it is incredible that it should have been necessary to exert pressure on the Bank in connection with its guarantees from the EU before it
I will put it like this: it would have been easier to enter Fort Knox in the United States than it was to enter the doors of the Investment
The only way in which we can obtain a better relationship with the population of Europe is by being open and showing that we are using their money honestly
Mr President , I would like to make two comments , one concerning the main objective of the subject of today' s debate , the guarantee by Union budgets of the external loans
The issue is especially relevant , given its urgency , insofar as we do not have a lot of time to implement the new procedure , since the current system ends at
Having said this , I would also like to tell her that , with regard to the report , many issues have been accepted , while others we have not been able to
As we have already told you , we think that it is much better , on the subject of the definition of policies , to speak of a solution by means of
It is clearly not a new issue and many of you have worked on it for many years , and I would like to be a little less negative than
It is true - and some of you have said so - that , with regard to relations with the Court of Auditors , there is a problem of primary legislation which
I insist once again that this issue is well-known , but no less important for being so: the Member States are the Bank' s shareholders and the Member States must take
I believe that we have moved forward greatly in the sense that the European Investment Bank has accepted that OLAF has all the information and means necessary to analyse
And when we talk of own resources we are in fact talking about two different realities: loans with own resources and guarantees from the Union or loans without guarantees
I would like this principle of openness which has developed in relations with the Bank to move forward and that finally we may arrive at a result which is satisfactory
to the Parliament and the European Investment Bank , without forgetting , as I said before , that the EIB is a financial institution which can provide information with no restriction on any
It can provide information , with some restriction , to OLAF and , of course , with regard to the Court of Justice , the final position will have to be that which is
In any case , the debate has been enormously interesting and I hope that what I have heard today will not be an obstacle , however , so that we can move forward
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0054/99) by Mr Sepp√§nen on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the Proposal for a Council Decision granting a Community
The Commission is proposing , at the request of the Council , that a decision be made to grant a loan to Turkey of EUR 600 million out of EIB funds ,
The Committee on Budgets , for its part , has prepared the ground for a swift transfer of funds from the guarantee reserves to the guarantee fund headings in the budget
We are all unanimous on the need for humanitarian assistance , and we consider the Council' s decision to designate for that purpose EUR 600 million out of EIB funds
At present , the general figure of 70% is granted to the EIB; in the Council they have already agreed to lowering it to 65% , and Parliament , in connection with
For these reasons , I have recommended three amendments to the Commission' s proposal , the first of which concerns the general ceiling for the guarantee fund , and the two others the
Over the years to come , we will have a problem if the especially large credit being granted to Turkey that we are discussing accounts for so large a proportion of
As a result , we should reach an agreement with the Commission so that it would propose raising the guarantee fund ceiling in case there are new , unexpected aid requirements
Depending on their replies , the Committee and Parliament may deem it necessary to propose an amendment , in which the Commission will be reminded that it may revise the excessiveness
Mr President , I would like on behalf of the Greek Communist Party and the Greek people as a whole to express our condolences for the victims and our support for
It is vital and urgent that we take all the measures and provide all the funding needed to help deal with the consequences of the recent earthquake disaster in Turkey
The Council and the Commission must ensure that the funding proposals needed are implemented as quickly as possible and , at the same time , ensure that these funds are used
However , the earthquakes must not be used as an excuse for releasing financial protocols and granting other funds to the Turkish Government which has failed to honour its commitments and
comply with the conditions imposed with respect to democratisation , respect for human rights , minority rights , compliance with international law , the settlement of the Cyprus question and cessation of hostilities towards
This is why we wish to reiterate our opposition to funding in connection with the implementation of Customs Union and the corresponding proposals in the draft budget for the year
We would like to take this opportunity to stress the more general need for adequate funding to be made available for fast and immediate intervention in order to relieve
Firstly - and here I would like to address Mr Korakas' concerns - we are talking of humanitarian aid , of a process which is different to any other Union aid
This humanitarian aid was initially granted as a result of the earthquakes which took place in August , but the Commission would also like to extend its scope to the
We believe that the quantity will not be altered significantly , but we do think that it would be difficult to differentiate between the damage caused by one earthquake or
We have carried out a thorough and detailed analysis , and , according to the information available , on the basis of the maximum use envisaged there is still a surplus in
This leads us to believe that there is little sense therefore in modifying the system of reserves at the moment , because this difficulty would only arise in the event
For this reason the Commission always has the margin to confront this possibility of an increase in the reserve Fund , although we feel that it is not necessary to
With regard to the possibility of the 60 or 65% , we could agree with your idea of accepting 60 rather than 65% , which seems to us to be a coherent
This would require a modification of the regulations which are currently applicable , which in turn would lead to a delay in the decision-making process on humanitarian aid , one of
Therefore I would hope that my explanations are satisfactory , that Parliament may reconsider its requests , that the acceptance of this decision may be dealt with as a matter of the
greatest urgency with the guarantee that , if there are financial problems in the future , the Commission would bear in mind the need to go further with regard to the reserve
Transitional arrangements for bilateral investment agreements between Member States and third countries (debate)
Council establishing transitional arrangements for bilateral investment agreements between Member States and third countries
- C7-0172/2010 -
Madam President , this has been a complicated issue to deal with
We have over a thousand bilateral investment agreements
According to the Treaty of Lisbon , this falls within the competence of the EU
How should we handle this situation
It is not proving to be very easy
We have had a lot of meetings and we have tried to find a common position , but without success
I might as well be honest about that
We will have to vote on it and see what Parliament's position will be
I would have liked us to have had a position that we all agreed on in order to be better placed to enter into negotiations with the Council
We would then have been able to defend Parliament's powers and principles as laid down in the Treaty
That was not to be , on account of the fact that this is a sensitive subject , particularly when it comes to how to deal with the old agreements
is a reasonable balance between the rights of investors and other rights
This was difficult to do with regard to the old agreements , however , and I have therefore retained the compromises that we proposed in committee , as the vote was very even
who invested in other countries
Nowadays , we have at least as many investments coming into our Member States
environment and social matters
We must defend this part of the Treaty
Investment policy cannot fail to take it into account , either
As I said , we will have to see how the vote goes tomorrow
Another problem we have here is the fact that we cannot even use the reasoning of providing maximum protection for investments
That is not the right way to create legal certainty
Since the new trade policy is more balanced , we must also have a more balanced view of what maximum protection can entail
We surely do not want to provide maximum protection here to foreign state-owned companies , or even companies owned by dictatorships , at the expense of human rights and the environment
This is a balance that I hope we will be able to achieve
The idea is not that we should use investment agreements to achieve social objectives , but neither should they prevent us from achieving social and environmental objectives
This is a far-reaching debate
Another important debate concerns transparency
We recognise that Parliament and the EU have been given new competences
The Commission is now responsible
Therefore , it must also have access to the documents
We must increase transparency
Many of these agreements were written at a time when there were hardly any cases of dispute settlements
Now we have more than 300 cases and ongoing procedures
This must , therefore , be opened up to better scrutiny
we can stand united and defend openness and the new competences bestowed on us by the Treaty
I truly hope that that will be the case
I therefore hope that Amendment 13 will receive support
Without it , we will have absolutely no democratic control over these procedures
We need this if we are to retain and defend legal certainty
We are also seeing a tendency for many other countries , like the United States , Australia and Canada for example , to start to look at renewing their agreements
and made more transparent
Then we will have an investment policy for the future
That will be dealt with in a different context - the debate about the future itself
Member of the Commission
- Madam President , the regulation on transitional arrangements for bilateral investment treaties is an important legislative initiative
The Lisbon Treaty has entrusted the Union with a new exclusive competence on foreign direct investment
The continued existence , since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty , of more than 1 200 investment-related international agreements concluded by Member States is not questioned under international law
However , it is incompatible , under EU law , with the new exclusive competence on foreign direct investment
At the same time , these agreements serve as a valuable source of legal protection for European investors operating abroad
continued existence
arise with regard to the content of the agreements and their interaction with EU investment policy
We have to reserve appropriate mechanisms for Union action to permit the development and implementation of the policy at EU level
I understand that , in relation to the Commission proposal , the scope for such action is the most difficult issue - for Parliament and even more so for the Council
So the challenge we have here is to find a solution that safeguards the principles I have just outlined and is acceptable to both Parliament and the Council
find a compromise in the interests of the EU and of its investors
We believe that the amendments adopted by the Committee on International Trade constitute a basis for finding such a solution
They maintain fundamental trust in the Commission's proposal but , at the same time , seek a potential compromise
problems
Given the positions of the main protagonists in this process , we will all have to show some level of flexibility
The Commission is ready to play its part , to be flexible and to facilitate an agreement between Parliament and the Council , but this cannot be at any cost
We will be vigilant on the basic principles of our proposal
The existence of the bilateral investment agreements needs to be safeguarded but , at the same time , we cannot unconditionally bless agreements if they create significant problems
The Commission fully shares Parliament's sentiment that the competence on investment should be exercised primarily at EU level , and we support the objective of Europeanisation of investment negotiations
However , I need to make clear that the Commission will not be able to negotiate with all countries targeted for investment protection by Member States
Our Member States have investment treaties with more than 100 countries
Replacing those will be a very gradual exercise , taking years
That is why it is important to create an effective mechanism empowering the Member States , under certain conditions , to continue negotiating and concluding bilateral investment agreements
Such a mechanism should respect the procedures and prerogatives of the institutions involved
Finally , it needs to be emphasised that we are approaching a decisive stage of the legislative process , and time is becoming a major factor
It is important because the longer the adoption of the regulation takes , the longer the limbo period lasts , with the potential to create legal uncertainty for investors
I hope that , after the vote , Parliament and the Council can sit down together to find an early agreement on this issue
We are ready actively to support them in that endeavour
to draw up a proposal which will achieve - and has achieved - a committee majority
As Mr Schlyter said , whatever happens tomorrow - the voting results are anyone's guess - I hope they will reflect what has been done by the committee
Creating a common investment policy for the European Union is a very important step forward in the integration of the European Union
legal protection
I also agree with Mr De Gucht
up good prospects for the Union's investment policy in the future , serving the Union as a whole
by Member States so that a common system of protection for the entire European Union could at last be established
It is important that the resolution which will be voted on tomorrow should be quickly agreed with the Council
This is something which is very important
I hope it will happen this year , with the active participation and support of the Commission
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen
In the era of the globalised economy , the European Union's common commercial policy seems quite natural to us
In this light , an initiative for the European Union to coordinate investment policy seems just as normal
investment agreements consistent with the horizontal objectives of EU policies
Personally , I would be in favour of placing the main emphasis on development policy
rules of which should be established in advance so as to avoid any legal uncertainty
Without such a timeline , the regulation would allow parallel , potentially incompatible investment schemes to emerge
investment policy is fully within the competence of the European Union
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am grateful to Mr Schlyter for his excellent report on a sensitive issue on which a great deal of common sense is needed
placing the emphasis on transparency
Ideally , we should have a clause that automatically repeals the 1 200 agreements currently in force
Unfortunately , however , that would mean legal uncertainty for investors and too much work , perhaps , for the Commission
be guaranteed
and the shadow rapporteurs in particular , to come up with a balanced measure that is acceptable to all
European Parliament , to find a satisfactory compromise for all sides , and looking for the best solution and developing this on a cooperative basis
This is not a simple issue
and workers on the other
That is why it is important that such an agreement should be reached on a democratic basis and that citizen's should remain confident in the controlling role of Parliament
For this reason , I hope that tomorrow's vote will show that the compromise that has been sought is supported by Parliament
on behalf of the EFD Group
will impact , and impact adversely , on the commerce of Member States
I know we are discussing transitional arrangements but what matters is that the Lisbon Treaty has removed from Member States the right to negotiate bilateral investment treaties
Some time in the future , and it is still not clear when , bilateral investment treaties will fall under the Commission
try to advance their political programme , and we have seen that in the trade treaties time after time
Attempts will be made to tack on to every investment treaty the full Green agenda
Now the Greens are talented politicians - and I say this in admiration
They will often succeed , and in consequence , investment and hence commerce in all Member States will be hamstrung and hobbled
By contrast , countries outside the EU will not be subject to the Greens' Pantomime of the Ents , if you remember those characters in the Lord of the Rings
It is all very , very depressing
(DE) Madam President , the security of investments both at home and abroad is of key importance for economic development both in Europe and in the relevant partner countries
The only way to secure existing jobs or to create new employment is by safeguarding investments
That is why there are two things that I regard as being important
Firstly , the over one thousand agreements already in existence must be retained
It makes no sense to cast investors , Member States and others into a state of legal uncertainty
Member States if we are also to have a uniform level of protection within the European internal market
succeeded in finding a broad consensus
solution that tries to cater to all needs
For my own group , I would like to state clearly once again that we want a good solution for investors , workers and Member States
We are looking for speedy negotiations with the Council , so that this issue is not put on the long finger , but that a solution is found soon
On account of the differences between the groups , my group favours completing the first reading this week
agreement
Once again , I would like to thank all those involved
reasonable timeframe
foreign investment policy
There will therefore be a transition period during which the competences relating to bilateral investment agreements between Member States and third countries will be transferred at EU level
In this situation , I believe that adopting an EU-level procedure for verifying and reviewing bilateral investment agreements is preferable to a formal intergovernmental arrangement
interest
all the European Union's Member States
through working together
The Dutch business community is amongst the largest investors worldwide
Indeed , the Netherlands has entered into 98 bilateral investment agreements with a very high level of protection
The proposed authorisation system gives the Commission overly extensive powers to withdraw approval from current investment agreements and too little certainty for these
level of protection is unacceptable
Authorisations should only be withdrawn when the EU has negotiated a new agreement with an identical level of protection
(DE) Madam President , there are four issues I would like to address very briefly
in the EU who wish to invest elsewhere
Both groups must be able to rely on the support of the existing contracts
Secondly: while we should be very grateful to the rapporteur for his truly comprehensive work , we should avoid trying to pack too much into trade agreements
by compromises
Accordingly , I should like to thank the rapporteur for his fairness in our cooperation
Let us wait and see how the vote goes tomorrow
Thirdly , I welcome Mr De Gucht's statement that the Commission was not questioning the existing agreements
This does not mean that the EU should not quickly conclude new agreements now that the Union has been reconstituted under the Treaty of Lisbon
on in an amendment , and with the limitation of the reasons for withdrawing approval to four clear criteria
on how many bilateral agreements one's own country has concluded
That is why it is a good thing that a transitional period is clearly defined in this directive
Madam President , out of some 2 500 bilateral investment treaties in the world , 1 500 concern EU Member States
Outside trade and investment are essential for economic recovery
Member States' economies
What sort of effect will EU exclusive competency on bilateral investment have on Member States
of Nations
gain or maintain advantages that may substantially support domestic economies
I would like to ask the Commission whether it actually recognises pacta sunt servanda in international law
(EL) Madam President , the adoption of a common foreign investment policy which safeguards equal treatment for all European investors is a very important move
to be avoided and the necessary security of law must exist for European investors
I would point out that the legislation of the Member States of the Union , in conjunction with unifying legislation , provide every guarantee needed for third country investors
of the Union need to remain in force
The draft resolution does not , in my opinion , safeguard the necessary security of law in any way whatsoever
current or execute new agreements; secondly , the provision to review the legal framework within five years; and thirdly , the extremely time-consuming procedures for executing new agreements
The amendments adopted by the Committee on International Trade are , in my view , a move in the right direction
I repeat , the objective should be to maintain existing and simplify the procedure for executing and applying new bilateral agreements
(RO) Madam President , Member States' investment policies must be harmonised at EU level as part of a common commercial policy
Member States should ensure that bilateral investment agreements are compatible with the Union's development policies
The Commission must gradually replace existing agreements with new ones which will offer an ideal system for protecting investments
Due to the risky nature of direct foreign investments , a high level of legal certainty must be guaranteed during the transition period
In this regard , I welcome the approach adopted by the Commission and rapporteur , based on coexistence
It is vital for bilateral agreements to remain in force and for Member States to be able to finalise negotiations or initiate new ones
Finally , I support setting a timeframe with a deadline for the transition from Member States' bilateral agreements to EU international agreements
(SK) Madam President , Commissioner , the protection of EU Member States' cross-border investments has become an extremely complex and delicate issue following the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon
impairing the rights of the parties involved
under preparation
parties
Member of the Commission
- Madam President , I would simply like to touch upon the question that has been raised by several Members of this Parliament on compatibility with EU policies
We aim to be flexible and to achieve a good compromise for the transitional regulation
of major concern for Member States and many Members of Parliament
as opening the door to all sorts of additional requirements that existing investment agreements should meet
I believe such an approach would be strongly opposed by Member States as considerably increasing the level of legal uncertainty for investors benefiting from these agreements
the Council as regards the legislative procedure
The outcome of tomorrow's vote will be discussed with the Ministers during the public debate next Friday
Next Friday , we have a Foreign Affairs Council on trade , and this will be one of the topics that we will discuss
I hope - and I am confident - that your votes will provide the basis for an agreement
I hope that this will not hinder us from reaching an early agreement at second reading
Madam President , I would like to thank everyone who has participated in the debate
It has been difficult
Some points that were taken up by Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl and others relate to security and fairness
That is precisely what we are all agreed on: investments must be fair , people should be treated fairly and we must have a reasonable level of security
At the same time , we cannot over-protect them like molly-coddled infants
It is like a minefield sometimes; we take hits occasionally and we develop our awareness
On the other hand , the risks must be reasonably predictable and we must be able to understand what risks we are taking
new decisions
That would be unfortunate
the ones who interpret how it is to be applied
We are very well aware that you cannot review every single agreement and query everything , but can only look at serious violations
It is also good that we are in agreement that Articles 5 and 6 should be retained
It would be unfortunate if the Commission's only means of querying an agreement were to be to take the matter to the European Court of Justice
If an agreement is called into question and the European Court of Justice says that the agreement is invalid , hundreds of agreements would suddenly become invalid without warning
That would certainly not be a practice that would result in legal certainty
It is important for Articles 5 and 6 to be retained
I completely agree with Mr Caspary that our negotiations should be conducted quickly
Irrespective of how the vote goes tomorrow , it is important that we conduct the negotiations quickly
I have already spoken to the Hungarian Presidency and it is ready and willing to deal with this matter as soon as we have voted
It could also conceive of a decision at first reading , but it does not look as if that will be the case here
I do not think that the Earl of Dartmouth need worry that the Greens will take over investment policy
There are many forces that wish to keep it precisely as it has been for the last 50 years
I have to say that even if you admire our political capability to get proposals through , please do not exaggerate it
For my part , I admire your rhetorical skills
With their help , perhaps we could get even more green policy through
As I have already said , we will have to vote this week and see how it goes
I would like to thank those involved and also the Hungarian Presidency , which I have met with on a number of occasions
The debate is closed
The vote will take place on Tuesday , 10 May 2011
Written statements (Rule 149)
An attempt has been made at both WTO and OECD level to introduce comprehensive multinational regulations for foreign direct investment , or FDI , that would apply to all economic sectors
millions
The EU is both a recipient and provider of foreign direct investment
judgments based on international law entail commitments to investors by Member States that give rise to EU Treaty infringement proceedings
Direct investment is certainly not the miracle cure claimed during the economic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe , for example
local population of redundancies and wage cuts due to outsourcing and the relocation of production , should not be swept under the carpet
the independence of the legal system , and political stability
I believe there is a lack of honesty in relation to this pseudo-humanitarian development aid
The next item is the report by Carl Schlyter , on behalf of the Committee on International Trade , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the
With regard to the new agreements that the Member States are continuing and are entitled to enter into , we could undoubtedly have agreed on a policy in which there
I still hope that we have a more up-to-date view of the investment agreements than was the case with many of these old agreements , where we were the ones
We must therefore make sure that we have the necessary scope in our policy and also that investments are adapted to more developed , modern work in relation to the
We cannot have this total secrecy and I very much hope that , irrespective of what we think about this link between policy and investment , when it comes to transparency ,
It will be good if we can agree to update the existing dispute mechanisms and judicial procedures , because these are outdated and need to be brought up to date
Because the Lisbon Treaty does not contain arrangements clarifying the status of bilateral agreements , we need to establish legal certainty for investors benefiting from these agreements by authorising their
While it is important to authorise existing investment agreements , it is also important to foresee the possibility of taking action in a cooperative manner to address important issues that could
We realise , in this respect , that there are still some considerable gaps to be bridged between the institutions but , at the end of the day , we will have to
We note with satisfaction here that Articles 5 and 6 would still leave the Commission the power to review investment agreements and withdraw authorisation should such agreements create major
Madam President , I would like to begin by thanking Mr Schlyter , who , as the main rapporteur , created the appropriate framework for the committee's work in building a majority , in order
If firms within the European Union compete jointly within the same framework , on the same principles , the same should be true externally; they should have the same system of
I am very pleased that he is supporting the proposal negotiated by the committee , because it really is a very good compromise between various standpoints: a compromise between the
Commission's standpoint , on the one hand , and the opinions presented by the Member States , and , on the other , it is compatible with investors' interests , but most of all , it opens
It is very important that we are creating a new system , beginning by establishing a solid legal basis created by the agreements currently in force , and which were negotiated
The current system , relying on Member States' numerous overlapping , and sometimes conflicting , bilateral investment agreements , should be replaced within a reasonable timeframe by a new framework of European Union
I agree with the rapporteur that the transition to the new regime should not take place overnight but should play out within a predetermined transitional period , the duration and
A sufficiently long transition is needed to make the open-ended duality in EU investment policy unacceptable for Parliament , as the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that
Not all investment agreements can be replaced by European agreements , but not even the Commission can ignore agreements that infringe European provisions , and we agree with the rapporteur about
Our amendments in the Committee on International Trade have been successful , firstly , in ensuring that the Commission's powers are fully respected and , secondly , in stating that legal certainty should
Some of the amendments on which we will be voting tomorrow in plenary may now alter this compromise and balance , and I call on my fellow Members , and the rapporteur
Madam President , Mr De Gucht , ladies and gentlemen , I would also like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Schlyter , for his hard work and for trying , in the spirit of the
It involves a common European Union investment policy in the context of international trade policy with all their concomitant effects on the situation in the EU and the Member States
with regard to social , economic and employment policy , weighing up the interests of financial groups , big business and economic enterprises , on the one hand , and those of the trade unions
- Madam President , the Lisbon Treaty is normally regarded as having been constitutional in its scope; but what we have here is an example of how the Lisbon Treaty
Because of Lisbon , investment treaties can become an instrument for the Commission's political objectives - and not just the Commission's: we can be absolutely sure that the Greens will
Secondly , and this is particularly important for us: in future , we will have to have many common European agreements that apply to all 27 Member States and investors from these
For this reason , I am very grateful to my fellow Members - Mr Schlyter , as well as Mr Zalewski , Mr Sturdy and Mr Rinaldi - because they have tried and
I think it would be a good thing if the other groups would reconsider this issue and recognise that the compromise on the table is actually a very good
Finally , I would like to add that we would be very open to finding a swift solution in the second reading - and we would be very grateful if
this were possible - in other words , we would suggest that , rather than following the normal procedure of the second reading , we should try to find a so-called early second-reading
I think that by adopting this legislative process , the Committee on International Trade is showing that we are capable of dealing with complex issues and complex dossiers within a
(RO) Madam President , since 2009 , commercial policy has come under the exclusive remit of the European Union and we must now find a common denominator for a large part of
The role of completing the implementation of the changes must be given to the European Commission and not to Member States , so as to ensure protection of the common
This is why the European executive has to guarantee both legal certainty for the investors due to be affected by the transition process and equivalent investment conditions for companies from
(NL) Madam President , the Netherlands , my native Member State , has been a trading nation for centuries , and the Commissioner ought to respect that , because we have formed a single country
The threat that Member States might have to cancel their current bilateral investment agreements at the Commission's instigation before the EU enters into a new agreement with an equivalent
The first is that this project should come under an enormous banner guaranteeing security and reliability for investors who wish to invest in the EU , as well as investors
I must contradict the rapporteur because this is quite a typical process for dealing with differences of opinion at committee or parliamentary level and not everything can be accommodated
However , if Mr De Gucht believes this to be the case , he will certainly agree with the significant weakening of the instrument for examining existing agreements , which we voted
Which brings me to my final point: it has been made quite plain in these discussions and during the committee's work that there are different interests at stake here , depending
I doubt whether many external markets trust trade packages with the EU in the light of the failing euro and the Commission's botched attempts to save three of its
The UK has a trade deficit with the EU and relies on negotiations with third countries , many of which have been in place for years and relate to our Commonwealth
I am appalled that the EU is seeking to implement a device to proffer national packages at Union level by majority voting , undermining the ability of individual Member States to
However , until such time as it is possible to conclude investment agreements at Union level , a legal vacuum - the legal uncertainty referred to by Mr Caspary - needs
On the other hand , if a high level of protection is to be safeguarded for Europeans investing in third countries , the current bilateral agreements executed by individual Member States
I refer , in particular , to the points relating to: firstly , the Commission's discretionary powers to withdraw the authorisation to maintain existing agreements or to approve new negotiations to amend
More than 1 200 bilateral investment agreements concluded by Member States under different , frequently incompatible , legal regimes need to be placed comprehensively under the auspices of the European Union without
The only possible way out of the legal stagnation brought about by transferring Member States' powers to the European Union would appear to be a principle allowing both sets
of agreements to coexist over a transitional period , in order for Member States to renegotiate existing bilateral agreements or , in line with EU investment policy , to complete negotiations on agreements
Even so , proper cooperation between the Commission and Member States must be maintained throughout this process , so that there is absolutely no loss of legal certainty for investors and contracting
These amendments go even further than the Commission's initial proposal for the regulation , as they considerably expand the scope of the review and withdrawal mechanisms which are already a source
These new criteria , relating to incompatibilities with established policies of the Union or general principles of the Union set out in Article 21 of the Treaty , could be regarded
To return to the next steps in this procedure , I believe that tomorrow's vote will be an important signal for all stakeholders in this process , and most notably also for
I understand that tomorrow , there will be a vote on the amendments and on the report as a whole but - as Mr Caspary , among others , has said -
If we are too over-protective , we will retain our old industries and miss out on the change and renewal that we need because we do not dare to take
Therefore , I do not quite understand the Commissioner's criticism of some of the compromises that are being tabled again here , as we refer to the Treaty and you are
The legal protection offered by the bilateral investment treaties (BITs) is important in ensuring that businesses are encouraged to take the step of investing abroad , which can cost many
It remains to be seen whether a move to coordinate the good 200 BITs in operation in the European Union can finally resolve the problem whereby binding BIT arbitration
Although greater predictability in relation to FDI opportunities for EU investors is something to be welcomed , the potential negative aspects of investment policy , for example , the fear among the
Likewise , we need to make it clear to developing countries that FDI can only improve living standards if the fundamental institutional requirements are met , such as clear property rights ,
Review of the European Neighbourhood Policy - Eastern Dimension - Review of the European Neighbourhood Policy - Southern Dimension
The next item is the joint debate on the Commission statements on:
Review of the European Neighbourhood Policy - Eastern Dimension
Review of the European Neighbourhood Policy - Southern Dimension
Member of the Commission
- Madam President , I am delighted to have this opportunity to have an exchange of views with Parliament on the European Neighbourhood Policy
In the context of the current events in the Southern Mediterranean , redeveloping this policy could not be more important
In fact , over the past nine months , the Commission has undertaken a review of the policy
I want to take this opportunity to thank Members for their input into the consultation , which took responses from partner countries , EU Member States , academics and civil society groups
I have read both M√°rio David's report on the south and Marek Siwiec's report on the east and find them both significant and useful
I am pleased that our thoughts are along the same lines
March
Now , we are preparing for the wider communication on the results of the review , which is due to be published in May
A key outcome of the review is a new emphasis on differentiation of the Neighbourhood Policy , according to the needs and wishes of each partner country
While the policy will continue to offer engagement to all partners , every neighbour is different and has different aspirations
of other benefits of the Neighbourhood Policy
So it will deliver more for more , in a specific and differentiated way , alongside stronger political steering of our relationship with our partners
heart of the revised Neighbourhood Policy for all partner countries
They should find their expression in stronger joint commitments to the elements indispensable to democratisation
I am thinking , in particular , of free and fair elections , freedom of expression and association , judicial independence , the fight against corruption and security sector reform
As highlighted in both reports , the revised Neighbourhood Policy will also recognise and act on the importance of the civil society
Non-governmental organisations have the expertise and experience to deliver democratic and market-oriented reforms from the bottom up , based on shared values
civil society
This is also important at a regional and sub-regional level where , for example , the Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum has been making good progress
The forthcoming communication will offer more detail on the approach towards the two sub-regions of our neighbourhood
It will spell out how we see the Eastern Partnership developing further in the wake of the summit under the Polish Presidency
In the south , the Union for the Mediterranean has the potential to make a real difference but , frankly , it has not yet done so , and must be revitalised
Its promise lies in developing concrete economic projects with a focus on employment , innovations and growth
economic projects
economic integration to help advance stability and prosperity in partner countries
The most significant vehicle to achieve this is the deep and comprehensive free trade area
A successful DFCTA has a transformative power
Regulatory reforms made by a partner country are encouraged through trade
Next , the need for improved mobility between partner countries and the European Union since there is no better way to promote European values than through sharing experience person to person
The Neighbourhood Policy will seek improvements to mobility without losing sight of security
Finally , the desire expressed in the consultation by many partner countries for greater political engagement with the European Union
Closer and more substantial political dialogue across all areas of our relationship will help us resolve difficult issues in a spirit of mutual confidence
Thank you very much for your attention
I very much look forward to the coming debate and I will take your views on board
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the historic times we are living through demand firm and determined action
Like many of you , we have been watching the events unfolding in the Mediterranean region with a mixture of hope , concern and expectation
will lead to a greater EU presence in this area , not only as a customer , but also as a committed partner
The absolute necessity of advocating our fundamental values in our relations with our neighbouring countries must be stressed from the outset
We can no longer acquiesce in our defence of democracy , human rights and , especially , social justice
with a particular focus on women's rights
In the future , the Union must favour a bottom-up approach to its Neighbourhood Policy
It is vital that this happens
Only greater involvement by local communities and civil society will ensure maximum effectiveness in implementing it
to the south
state , with clear benchmarks and careful assessment that could lead to a future Mediterranean economic area , incorporating the new democracies of the south
policy
Madam President , Commissioner , we have reached the final , today , or rather the semi-final , of work in connection with a review of the European Union's Eastern policy
We might say that the Neighbourhood Policy was once designed as a kind of 'consolation prize' for countries which were not going to accede to the European Union
What is the situation like today
What are the countries like which are included in the policy
been achieved in those years by Moldova in comparison with Ukraine and , for example , with the tragic situation in Belarus
economies are working much more efficiently - and we have played our part in this
This is the effect of Eastern policy , which today is called the Eastern Partnership
these countries , in a variety of ways and at different speeds , are going to move towards our values - towards what the European Union offers them
If it is an √† la carte policy , then let those countries show initiative , and let us respond well to those initiatives
We want , to a greater degree , and this is written in the report , to make Neighbourhood Policy something for the citizens , the elite , journalists and young people
We want them to see what our life is like , and that it is worth organising life in the way we do
We want , in the long run , to make it easier to travel to the European Union - we want the visa system to be easier
Let us also say , as we do in the report directly: yes , this policy needs money
state administration which is capable of wasting that money
Finally , let us say something about the conflict
For there is a conflict in this Chamber about the fact that we are not able or do not want to say clearly what the wording is
(The President cut off the speaker)
debate on the urgency of reforming the Eastern and Southern Dimensions of the European Neighbourhood Policy
necessity following the dramatic changes and processes which have unfolded in the region
the events unfolded , is today a complete document
It emphasises our responsibility to develop relations with the countries in the region on the basis of modern values , democratic freedoms and human rights
women , recognition of diversity and protection of all minorities
All of this should become an integral part of the policy which the European Union promotes in its neighbourhood in the future , including through its diplomatic service
for a fair exploitation of natural resources
are effective
introduction of new technologies
outstanding problems in the region
on the road to peace , reconciliation and a new development framework in the region
(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))
Madam President , I wonder if Mr Vajgl has considered the cost to the EU taxpayer of these extra-territorial initiatives proposed in the report and which he is also endorsing
very beneficial when compared with the damage that might arise if we do not engage more in this area
on the part of the European Union
Madam President , the Eastern Partnership is still very new
Therefore , it is important for us to evaluate , as we do in this report , whether our Eastern European neighbours have come any closer to the objectives of democratic reform
It is clear that there has been progress in this area , but we have also seen setbacks
and repression , is obviously more attractive and provides more guidance than what the EU has to offer
we must rely on forces other than corrupt governments
self-organisation of civil society
The Civil Society Forum , founded as part of the Eastern Partnership , is a good start
It is also currently the only body in which the Belarus opposition is involved
Unfortunately , the seats at Euronest will remain empty while there is no freely and correctly elected parliament in the country
The Civil Society Forum needs our support , as we have described in paragraph 20 of the report
However , it will remain a mere declaration of intent unless we back it up with effective measures
Therefore , I am calling on you urgently to support Amendment 5 tomorrow which provides for continuous financial support and a secretariat for the organisation
Please support Amendment 5 tomorrow so that we can make progress on developing a civil society
This really is an excellent approach
I have experienced myself in Berlin how people can achieve objectives of this kind by working from the grassroots upwards
on behalf of the ECR Group
- Madam President , the Middle East and North African countries of the Southern Neighbourhood clearly need the EU's long-term political and - where appropriate - financial support
In countries such as Egypt , Tunisia and Libya , we should concentrate our efforts on consolidating nascent democratic awakenings into a lasting legacy of stable , secular and enlightened governance
Korea to develop a nuclear weapon and his political support for Iran and for terrorism
Inevitably , the ongoing turbulence demands a refocusing of ENP priorities towards the South
However , this should not happen at the expense of our partners in the Eastern Dimension
Some of those countries have also embarked on a long-term process of democratic transition , openness and reform
Dimension has more acute need of the EU's attentions now
On Libya , I strongly support the no-fly zone and the pressing need for regime change
even to buy arms
legislation appears to transpose 1970 incorrectly , with a blanket arms embargo
(The President cut off the speaker)
Madam President , Mr F√ºle , Mr Siwiec , thank you for devoting yourself to this subject
Parliament's almost unanimous opinion is that Neighbourhood Policy has not produced the expected results
I agree with that
However , I do not agree with the analysis of the causes
The results do not meet our expectations because we have not focused on the interests which we have in common with our neighbours
Instead , we have concentrated on our own interests and on our ideas of how neighbouring countries should develop
Quite obviously , what we need is a different approach
future without outside interference
joint problems
We will not make any progress in our Neighbourhood Policy unless we change our views and develop new political approaches

Lukashenko
She writes , quote , 'Our people are afraid of a revolution , too
However , nobody wants to carry on living like this anymore
Before the election , the political dialogue in our society had only just begun , but you blatantly nipped it in the bud straightaway
Our country has been paralysed by fear again
' Unquote
Alexeyivich urged Lukashenko to resume dialogue with the people
Was that perhaps a na√Øve idea
nation hostage and as a dictator with small man syndrome over whom only the Kremlin could exert any real influence
However , the point is that there is no evidence that Lukashenko is happy to place all his eggs in Moscow's basket
In view of that , the European institutions could provide a strategic opening , despite the current difficult situation
I wish Commissioner F√ºle much wisdom , perseverance and , indeed , the full support of our Parliament in establishing and making the most of responsible contact with Belarus
(EL) Madam President , I thank the Commissioner for his comments
It is true that the European Neighbourhood Policy and Eastern Dimension were decisive steps in efforts to deepen relations with our neighbours to the East
Nonetheless , today , there is an urgent need to give new impetus to this effort
the Eastern Dimension has faced , and still faces , similar challenges
Events in Belarus are very clearly a message and wake-up call for the European Union in terms of the responsibilities which it must assume in such cases
We need a long-term strategic plan for growth and stability in the region
Consequently , the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy - and the Eastern Dimension - must reflect an assumption of greater political obligation on the part of our partners
points in evaluating the progress made by our partners
That is why we need clear priorities and quantifiable targets in advance
terms of the progress it has made , based on clearly defined criteria
Democracy and human rights brook no ambiguity; the European Union was founded on the basis of these principles and , therefore , has a moral obligation to maintain them in the future
Within this framework , the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy needs to give new impetus to efforts to promote a substantive political framework for cooperation with our eastern partners
(DE) Madam President , I would like to say something very briefly in response to my fellow Member's objection about the costs , despite the fact that he has disappeared again

I would like to say a few words about the Eastern Partnership
Other Members will be speaking about the Southern Partnership
positive and democratic development from the inside out
In response to Mr Schulz , who earlier said that Belarus and Ukraine were in the same situation , I would like to explain that the differences between them are very great
In Ukraine , we should look at the problems , but also at what is going well and at the positive changes
A brief comment on the Southern Caucasus , because it is important for us to focus on this area , too
The developments in Azerbaijan , where bloggers and demonstrators are being imprisoned , are alarming
It is shameful for a country like Azerbaijan and for its President to do things of this kind

Madam President , I would like to draw your attention to the frozen conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region , which is an inseparable part of the Republic of Azerbaijan

politically by the Kremlin authorities
This acknowledgement should always be reflected in documents and statements both in Parliament , the Council and the Commission
and in the region
(FR) Madam President , Commissioner , the popular movements in the Southern Mediterranean have clearly highlighted weaknesses in our European Neighbourhood Policy
promoting and respecting human rights and democracy - which are also social objectives - but rather in our flawed implementation of those objectives
Consequently , we need to learn lessons for the future
This is what is being done in the current work on reviewing the policy
in terms of trade or strategy , or their political situation
When neighbouring countries are in a state of transition , this is extremely useful and necessary
issue , that we need to learn to address effectively
at the highest political level
other bodies , such as the Justice and Home Affairs Council (JHA)
I support the communication on a partnership for democracy and shared prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean , which I believe is pivotal
It seems to me that we should also add a separate target for social justice and combating inequalities
Naturally , we will also need to rethink our understanding of mobility in the Mediterranean region
between the Northern and Southern Mediterranean and for both the host nation and the country of origin
We will also need to factor these changing movements into basic rights for those who cross the Mediterranean and settle in Europe
(PL) Madam President , the present discussion is taking place at a time when we are adopting a new approach to Neighbourhood Policy
to gain concessions in the areas of human rights and the principles of democracy
Therefore , I would like to take this opportunity to draw attention to the holistic approach to Neighbourhood Policy
Let us not think back over just the last few months; let us also remember earlier events , such as those which have taken place in Belarus

We are not thinking about sharing wealth but about sharing security

(FR) Madam President , the Arab revolutions have given rise to a great deal of hope in the countries concerned and beyond
They have demonstrated that democracy and human rights can be universal values
However , the people of these countries remain very sceptical about the European Union
I can understand that in the light of past history and of the support given to dictators
by these countries - and worse , when I see that some governments , including my national government , are still demanding that European aid be conditional on readmission agreements
This is a strange understanding of mobility

I would like a detailed answer to my question , Commissioner
underbelly of Africa to the underbelly of Russia
same time , the failure of the economic and social reforms in these countries supported by the Union
The autocratic regimes in Libya , Tunisia , Egypt and other countries have been in place for years and we cooperate with them
Now , all of a sudden , we are taking action against them
We therefore need to review the European Neighbourhood Policy strategy by promoting democracy and human rights and controlling planned financing
European citizens are in exactly the same position
Madam President , developments in the Southern Neighbourhood have provoked a lot of criticism of the EU Neighbourhood Policy as pursued so far
We should be critical , of course , but we should also be fair
one of the main issues now to be added to the review of Neighbourhood Policy
These developments , to some extent , follow the engagement of the European Union with those countries
So , in that respect , we need to review this policy , and to adapt it , but we should not simply criticise what has been done so far
As such , the EP reports are an important contribution to the ENP review and I hope they will be taken into consideration by the Commission
I would like to warn against the attempts to oppose East and South , not only as regards refocusing attention , but also , maybe , as regards reallocating funds and resources
peaceful solution of frozen conflicts and to consolidate democracies
(FI) Madam President , it is very important that , in addition to the Southern Neighbourhood Policy , we should also be talking about an Eastern Neighbourhood Policy
There are very many internal administrative problems associated with it , and the administration of Russian programmes , at least , should be transferred to the DirectorateGeneral for Regional Policy
The reason for this is that the authorities administering the programmes would be able to revise them to reflect more particular regional features and conditions
This would also be a way to guarantee their continuity
We have to remember that this change would not , in itself , require any special amendments to the legal basis of the programmes or the EU budget
It would instead be more a case of an internal decision on the part of the Commission
At present , there are very many problems within these programmes , and we should effect some structural changes to them
This would constitute a clear message , and I hope that the Commission will also do what it can to back this decision
(PL) Madam President , European Neighbourhood Policy and , as part of this , the Eastern Partnership , is a key area and challenge for the European Union
It is an important political framework for strengthening relations with the partner countries - countries with which we should be moving towards economic and political integration
this , it is essential for there to be greater political commitment from the authorities in Kiev
Let us not forget the Europeans in Belarus , a country with a civilisation similar to our own , but one which is kept closed by the Lukashenko regime
Let us do everything we can for Belarusians to see that Europe remembers them and supports their endeavours to gain democracy

By facilitating travel and contacts between the Union and Belarus , we can undermine the Lukashenko regime much more effectively than with dozens of statements or resolutions

A debate on the Eastern Partnership is also necessary due to the fact that it is not entirely clear that we all accord the same importance to this project
and for the six neighbouring states
Confusion has been caused by the statements of some politicians , who talk of a Black Sea synergy or of a democratic buffer zone
At this point , the Eastern Partnership ceases to be an instrument
(The President cut off the speaker)
neighbouring countries
The EU's cooperation with the countries of the Eastern Partnership creates an opportunity for these countries to make political progress towards the values of freedom and democracy
partners that are prepared to go further and faster in fulfilling their obligations
We could do more to encourage Ukraine and Moldova , in particular , to make headway in negotiations and to try and reach agreement on a broad and comprehensive free trade zone
In my opinion , we should also continue negotiations with Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia
Belarus will have to find a form of communications appropriate to the political situation
The inhabitants of the country must not , however , become hostage to their political representatives , who have decided to implement their own version of democracy
(NL) Madam President , today , we are laying down an important foundation for the development of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI)
I would highlight just one point here , a specific point for the Commissioner on the programmes for external borders , the cross-border programmes
We have 15 programmes with a budget of EUR 1
1 billion
However , we keep hearing from all sides that they are not going well
Development has been slow
Flexibility is very limited and I understand , from what I have heard today , that the Polish Presidency intends to tackle this
which we have been familiar with for years
My question to the Commissioner is: how are you going to address this
Actually , according to the ENPI Regulation , you were already supposed to have carried out an evaluation last year
I have not seen the documents pertaining to that
could invite the people most concerned and hear about their experiences
I have a feeling that some things really need to be modified
(IT) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , with this review of the EU's neighbourhood policies , we are setting forth on a journey that will not end any time soon
The events in the Mediterranean signal a process of profound change and they will have lasting consequences , not only for the countries of the region , but also for Europe
We must be aware that the transition to full democracy will not be easy and that these transitions are accompanied by many risks and uncertainties
For this reason , there are numerous things we must do and these will take time
Europe's response must be characterised by a strategy based on immediate and long-term actions
We must facilitate access to European markets and allow greater mobility
financial resources available and provide assistance to the democratic process by strengthening parliamentary institutions and political parties , ensuring the full participation of all citizens
This should all happen within the framework of a revitalised Euro-Mediterranean dialogue
At stake is the strategic , political future of Europe
I believe that Europe must understand that we have to work to the east and the south , but right now , there is a special priority to the south
These policies need fundamental change; we must finally open a new chapter
(PL) Madam President , the Eastern Dimension is one of the most important areas for the European Union's development under the European Neighbourhood Policy
It includes such countries as Ukraine , Belarus , Moldova , Georgia , Azerbaijan and Armenia
to energy
It is through some of these countries that alternative energy routes to Russian pipelines , such as Sarmatia and the Nabucco gas pipeline , may be built
done and would bring these countries closer to the European Union , and the Union is , after all , already the biggest economic partner of these countries today
Ultimately , of course , we should think about a free trade area , which would naturally bring us together in a particular way
young people from the EU
Eastern Dimension of Neighbourhood Policy as well as the Southern Dimension
- about the situation in Abkhazia and in South Ossetia
A consistent European Union policy is needed on these matters today
and other members of the European Commission , and also by the Member States
Union Observation Mission should be given access to Abkhazia and South Ossetia as quickly as possible
freedom , justice and opportunity for all human beings
As a result , the EU has redefined its priorities for the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) to the south
I agree with the new orientations , dubbed 'the three Ms': 'money , market access and mobility'
democratisation processes
There is no democracy without political parties
began the Arab Spring
respect for human rights
This must be a fundamental orientation of EU political support for the Southern Mediterranean
should not be isolated but rather invited to play the democratic game
(PL) Madam President , for the policy we are discussing to bring the expected positive result , it will need to have money
We should , therefore , stick to the gentleman's agreement over a one third to two thirds division of the money available
This is necessary to be able to pursue the policy effectively
Secondly , we need a clear diagnosis of the situation
with the problems of democratisation
Thirdly , such a policy offers the prospect of membership to countries which are trying to achieve it
is an attainable goal , then it will certainly be more likely to be achieved
(ES) Madam President , Commissioner , I regret the Council's absence in today's debate
With regard to the Southern Neighbourhood , I shall make three points
Firstly , the European Union must support and facilitate the processes of democratic change
In the past , neighbouring authorities used their concerns over stability as a way of justifying their inaction
the North , but also South-South trade , which is currently non-existent
she appears to be advising those countries to specialise in agricultural exports to European markets
I disagree
Commissioner F√ºle is well aware of this , although he seems to be shaking his head
These countries need diversified economies and agriculture
I repeat: diversified
They also need to attend to their domestic food needs and not restrict themselves to a few export products which , in addition , cause concern for European farmers
We therefore need common sense and prudence on this issue
Thirdly , we need to revitalise the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) and its projects , which can help in the economic modernisation of the Mediterranean countries
Unfortunately , the UfM is still in deadlock , there is no General Secretary , and it cannot continue to be hijacked by the lack of progress between Israel and Palestine
Ladies and gentlemen , we are facing a major challenge
Madam President , the EU Eastern Neighbourhood could prove to be the best test for EU foreign policy
border'
It should also implement this in its own comprehensive strategy in order to bring about positive change
the region's instability and political and economic problems
It is enough to mention today's blast in Transnistria , which severely damaged the gas pipeline
There is an urgent need for the EU to support conflict settlement efforts , including through direct mediation , confidence building and humanitarian assistance to the millions of IDPs and refugees
That is why the EU should ensure that its considerable financial and technical support in the region is accompanied by a reinforced political presence and a well-defined conditionality
Policy , Mr Siwiec
These congratulations are not offered simply out of courtesy
for us , are the most important: respect for human rights , freedom of the media and democratic governments
there , particularly young people , are not only demanding more bread; they are also demanding greater freedom and more respect for their rights as citizens and people
The same is true of our neighbours in the East and , in particular , in a country which is an immediate neighbour of the European Union , Belarus
to us , Members of the European Parliament , at tomorrow's sitting of the Belarusian delegation
These are scandalous practices
European Neighbourhood Policy should help us prevent situations such as the one which occurred this afternoon in the case of Andrzej Poczobut
(SV) Madam President , I am grateful that the Commission has chosen to present this review of the European Neighbourhood Policy's Southern Dimension
It is certainly needed
We need to acknowledge that Europe has met dictatorships with tolerance rather than with tough demands for democracy
That has cost us in trust for Europe
We therefore need a new policy , a policy that will help to rebuild these countries after decades of misrule
Europe can do a great deal in this respect , above all , as the region's most important trade partner
The best approach would probably be to invest precisely in this rebuilding and trade in order to regain the trust that we have lost
order to help them to use trade to bring them prosperity
However , it is currently the European customs barriers , particularly in the agricultural sector , that are a major obstacle to development
be paid on them
That is an obstacle to development and prosperity
free market access in Europe
That is something we did for the Western Balkans following the war in Yugoslavia , and why not learn from this example
We are building Europe's prosperity on free trade in Europe , so why not help our North African neighbours to build their prosperity on free trade with us
(EL) Madam President , the European Neighbourhood Policy is , without doubt , a successful policy
However , we need to make it more dynamic and more effective
The adverse economic climate we face at the moment should not be used as an alibi or pretext for failing to strengthen it still further
This should apply mainly to its Southern Dimension
This is now urgently needed in the wake of the recent dramatic developments , the recent dramatic incidents in North Africa
These societies need our support; they need our essential but discreet support and I stress the word 'discreet' for obvious historic and political reasons
We need to support civil society in these countries , its democratic action and its demand for more freedom
countries through the Neighbourhood Policy
Madam President , I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on the communication on partnerships , which adopted a quick and far-sighted approach
We are seeing a redesign of the Neighbourhood Policy and the Commission is the guardian of the holistic approach
I find it fatal to oppose the Southern neighbourhood and the Eastern neighbourhood
We are redesigning , and while there is good news about what is happening in the South , the importance of this redesign and rethinking goes beyond the South
It also includes the East
We should move from government-related or oriented policy towards society-oriented policy , and from short-sighted economic interest policy towards human rights and democracy-oriented policy
We should become , in our policy , generous towards societies and much more demanding and severe towards governments
Also , we should not mix up status quo with stability
We should move into a kind of transitional approach
Building this new paradigm for a Neighbourhood Policy brings with it the necessity to change the Eastern policy in the same direction
We should pay equal attention to both South and East
There should be symmetric financing , as there is a false dilemma in opposing both , and it should be smart financing
There is structural under-financing here
Each year , we are paying to the Neighbourhood Policy countries 20% of what we are paying to the rest of the world
I know how difficult it is to talk about financing today
But this policy has to be redesigned and that also requires additional financing
Madam President , at this time , it is important to consider carefully , and strike the right balance between , both the European Neighbourhood Policy factors
The ENP should become more flexible , proactive and optimised
If we want to create an area of stability , shared values and progress surrounding in Europe , we should , firstly , no longer limit ourselves with predefined quotas
Financial assistance should be balanced according to political involvement and the will to move closer to EU values , freedoms and standards
It should be result-oriented and tied to objective and clear criteria on democratisation and the progress achieved in reforms
neighbourhood
Thirdly , the attractiveness of EU assistance is also important
The simplification of EU fund allocation procedures and active sharing of expertise by the Member States at the early stages of programming would be an additional incentive
(RO) Madam President , I come from Gala≈£i , a Romanian city situated at the European Union's border with the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine
This is why I am going to mention specifically the review of the Eastern Dimension of the European Neighbourhood Policy
I must stress its importance both to the implementation of the European Union strategy for the Danube region and to the European Union's energy security
effectively
and to these countries' security
On the subject of the Union's priority energy projects , I should emphasise the importance of the Southern Gas Corridor
I think that the Nabucco gas pipeline , along with the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline , the Pan-European Oil Pipeline , the Turkey-Greece-Italy Interconnector or the
(The President cut off the speaker)
justified
of the judiciary and the fight against corruption
and Estonia and the suspicion of corruption in our Parliament
I hope very much that we will maintain a
(The President cut off the speaker)
Madam President , neighbourhood is the key word here
Even in private lives , having good neighbours is a great asset to anybody
A good neighbour is a person who is friendly , does not interfere unduly with one's affairs , but is willing to extend the hand of friendship in time of need
That is something that the European Union should practise as a policy
It is easy enough when your neighbouring countries are equally friendly and stable and democratic
If they are not , then one has more of a problem
The suggestion that we should engage with civil society , particularly in these countries , is a very good one
My colleague , Mr van Nistelrooij , pointed out that we are spending EUR 1
1 billion on border activities and that we need a more cohesive approach
I agree with that
and we can hear directly from them
(FR) Madam President , Commissioner , in your description of the outlook for the European Neighbourhood Policy in the Southern Mediterranean , you referred to potential catalysts
However , you forgot to mention one group , to which I myself belong
In Europe , people like me -immigrants and the children of immigrants - who come from the area that was once colonised by Europe , are still stigmatised
Yet we are , and we could become , human resources: influential mediators between north and south at this historic time
Commissioner F√ºle , what are your thoughts on that option
Will you take it into consideration
(LT) Madam President , the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy is one of our most important tasks
do not care about human rights , and that they are used to living under dictatorial regimes
The revolution in the Arab world has shown this to be a fallacy
A few weeks ago , I visited Egypt on the day the referendum was taking place in the country on amendments to the constitution
Everyone we met talked about freedom , justice and democracy
Most stressed that they need a different kind of support from the European Union
Support is needed to strengthen civil society , establish political parties and defend human rights , so that future parliamentary and presidential elections are democratic , free and fair
The democratic processes taking place there are very fragile and vulnerable , and we must help them in a timely manner
Member of the Commission
- Madam President , I appreciate one very important element , namely , that we , the Commission and Parliament , are approaching the review of our Neighbourhood Policy in parallel
It is not a situation , as with many other policies , where we come here with a product that has already been finalised and then have a discussion
a number of our ideas
The long list of speakers who have made a number of valuable suggestions and asked good questions is proof that this approach was the right one
In the Lisbon Treaty , which was also agreed and voted in this House , we set high ambitions
We agreed to have the European Union as a global player
our neighbourhood , including the protracted conflict
It was with that in mind that together , we started the review process in June last year
At that time , our ambitions were , firstly , to reflect on the new instruments brought in by the Lisbon Treaty
that is guaranteed by a person with a dual role , combining the CFSP Community instrument , and also having for the first time capacities in the External Action Service
Embassies have also been upgraded in order to represent not only the Commission but also the European Union
These are huge things
policy on external action
We wanted that to be reflected in our Neighbourhood Policy
We also wanted to do one of the important things that we sensed was missing
Looking at neighbourhood , we were lacking the feeling of ownership of these countries in the Neighbourhood Policy
Some of our partners were saying that the Neighbourhood Policy had been imposed on them and that they had actually never been consulted
account
But then the Arab Revolution came
and there and associate stability with autocracy , accepting that we have not always had the values in the same place as our interests
only those that related to the emerging democracies
We left the more difficult questions for the strategic ENP review
Many of them still need to be answered
In that communication of 8 March , we defined three basic pillars , which you will also see reflected in the strategic review
The first one supports the democratic transformation and institution building in our neighbouring states
In the second , the focus is on the relationship with societies and support for civil societies
The third gives support to inclusive and sustainable growth among our neighbours
Many countries in the South are changing , change which is not limited to those countries but to the whole region
neighbourhood
It will have repercussions in the East and there is a lesson-learned process in our joint thinking with our Eastern partners
South are not at the expense of our interest in the East
The ENP review process will strengthen the need for a balanced approach to our neighbourhood , whether it is the East or the South
There is a new momentum to substitute , sometimes , preferred real politics in our neighbourhood by an ambitious and much more proactive policy based on our values
There is also a momentum to be clear on what we want to achieve with , or through , the instruments of the Neighbourhood Policy
A couple of years ago , we referred to the peace , stability and prosperity zone
It is an important concept , which is still valid , but the partners want more
In the East , some of them are very clear as far as European aspirations are concerned
Those in the South want to have a more institutionally defined framework for economic integration
Should we shy away from offering our thoughts on these issues
I do not think so
way for them to build more of the European Union inside their countries
decision making , but decision shaping
Do not expect a very technical straightjacket for bilateral relations with our neighbours
Expect only very few , but very clear and very important benchmarks
and technical and financial assistance on the other
It is not going to be an easy process
a reality check , will be an important quality incorporated in this review of the ENP
Many of you talked about money
The higher our ambitions are , the more resources they will require
The logic here is very clear
But is it only about money
Absolutely not
issue are concerned
The Jasmine Revolution was very much about dignity and equity
Let us then turn these two issues - dignity and equity - into the principles our policy will be based upon
Parliament has a very important role to play in this regard
I have received two motions for resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure
The debate is closed
The vote will take place on Thursday , 7 April
Written statements (Rule 149)
in writing
- All European countries which fulfil the EU accession criteria should have the prospect of EU membership
of future membership
The strongest incentive for democratic and political reforms and creating civil society is , and will remain , the prospect of EU membership
While future applicants should do their homework in full , the EU has to prove without any doubt that our commitment to enlargement remains valid and credible
and foremost , on democratic values , respect for human rights and the rule of law
States
The same principles should be applied to relations with Russia , where the rule of law and human rights situation is worse than in most ENP countries
I have to confess that I was quite amazed on reading the resolution proposed by the Committee on Foreign Affairs
prices and unemployment , is quite beyond my understanding
In my opinion , the absurd conclusion is typical of the absurdity of so-called politicians
Mr Siwiec clearly did not notice the demonstrations involving dozens of deaths in the monarchies of the Arab world , or the war in Libya
That is clearly just as it should be
In point 12 , there is no statement on the negative developments in Moldova
the government has managed to improve the economic and political situation of the country substantially over the past year
In my opinion , the call in point 13 for multilateral support for the development of democratic parties in Belarus constitutes direct intervention in the internal affairs of another state
It is a pity that we do not see similar efforts to develop democracy in EU states such as Hungary , for example
and European Radio for Belarus
It reminds me very much of the Cold War period , as we know it from the history books
In today's debate in the European Parliament , we have held a further discussion about the Eastern Dimension of the European Union's Neighbourhood Policy
of civic , social and economic initiatives
countries , study and develop their passions and interests
It is very important to ensure better implementation of agreements on simpler visa procedures and an EU-Ukraine free trade area
We should also extend the stipend system for students from the Eastern countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy and encourage them to engage in greater social and political activity
and east
I want to stress , first of all , that it is counterproductive for us to make both geographical regions compete with each other
our Neighbourhood Policy
I am thinking , in particular , about respect for human rights , democracy and the rule of law
Moldova , but also the adverse developments , as has happened , unfortunately , with Belarus or Ukraine
Differentiation must be the basic criterion , which also applies to the Southern Neighbourhood
On the other hand , our demands in terms of our European partners' respect for the Union's common values must be consistent and very high
When we review the European Neighbourhood Policy , it is important to assess the impact of this policy on migration
No Neighbourhood Policy can be fully effective in this area without tackling the causes of instability that trigger migration
This entails regional cooperation , potentially via bilateral agreements , with both the countries of origin and with transit countries
We must cooperate with transit countries and with countries of origin for migration so as to prevent surges
We must help the migrants' countries of origin to democratise and attain good governance by giving them access to our values and our experience
With regard to the European Neighbourhood Policy , we need an economic agenda which can increase levels of employment and trade agreements that can generate real , market-driven , economic development
of democratic reforms and respect for human rights
This approach should be encouraged , as it is consistent with our values , effective for development , and does right by European taxpayers
for a genuine democratic transition and establishing the foundations for deep political , social and institutional reforms
corruption , but it is also necessary to reconsider and to examine carefully the EU's Mediterranean strategy in order to strengthen political dialogue and to support all democratic and social forces
The crisis of the Arab world has demonstrated that the direction pursued so far in the Neighbourhood Policy has failed
Financing instruments must be made more transparent , and a result-oriented approach must be applied during the disbursement of aid
This also holds true with regard to the Eastern Dimension of the policy
Partnership also have the prospect of obtaining candidate status
The matter of the mutual visa exemption between Ukraine and the EU should be treated pragmatically and should not be used to exert political pressure
The Ukrainian Government has much work to do in the area of reinforcing human rights and democracy
However , the last people we should be punishing for this are the Ukrainian citizens
If the European Council supports the Belarusian citizens while imposing sanctions on Belarus , it should not apply a different standard to Ukraine either
Granting visa exemption as soon as possible - hopefully still in this year - could lay the foundations of the economic trust required for creating a free trade area
I trust that the Polish Presidency will treat this matter as a priority
It is unfortunate that the Eastern Partnership summit could not take place during the Hungarian Presidency
several relations over the past years
in writing
- The European Neighbourhood Policy should remain European , not French , Romanian or Polish
but it would put an end to the European Neighbourhood Policy
The pressure brought to bear by France to fund the South while starving the programmes for the East could set an unfortunate precedent
Europe should deal with its neighbourhood , and not with prioritised neighbours
A transfer of funds from East to South would send a disastrous signal to our eastern partners
It does not make sense to support democracy in the South by weakening it in the East
The European aspirations and democratic values of Eastern partners could be further damaged by an impulsive visa liberalisation policy
There is no place for a 'Russia first' policy in this domain
Russian citizens have a right to free travel , but not before our partners in the East
Granting a visa-free regime to Russia would transform the Russian passport into a golden document sought after in Georgia , Moldova and Ukraine
It would internally destabilise these countries
I insist that the EU should seriously consider these problems
You will have noticed that the results of our previous discussions on Neighbourhood Policy are already reflected in the communication on a partnership for democracy and shared prosperity of 8
Some partner countries want to progress as far as they can towards the European Union - indeed as far as accession - but others prefer to make the most
Nevertheless , as both Mr David and Mr Siwiec recommend in their reports , our shared values of democracy , the rule of law and respect for human rights will be at the

I am , however , pleased with the proactive stance that Parliament is preparing to adopt on the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) - Southern Dimension , which I hope
We can no longer focus on short-term stability at the expense of the best interests of our citizens , of constantly defending them , and of their individual and collective freedom ,
However , I cannot help but voice my frustration: I regret the fact that Parliament and the Commission have not been willing to make the most of this opportunity to
differentiate once and for all between the ENP to the east - with countries that could , in the future , potentially become our partners in the Union - and the ENP
I also challenge the Commission to show , in its review process on 20 April , the ambition that the current situation demands , namely , with a tailor-made Neighbourhood Policy adapted to each
To finish , Commissioner , we trust that the good atmosphere and cooperation that have characterised work on this subject will lead to Parliament being permanently involved in planning and evaluating this
It can be said that the policy is a list of successes - different kinds of success - because it is not possible to say in a word what has
It can , however , be said that in these countries , more European values have appeared , more and better law is being made , greater concern for people is in evidence and
If we are talking , today , about the fact that we want to conduct a review of this policy , then it is crucial to say that we want to see that

This is particularly true of the Union for the Mediterranean where it is evident that we need more elaborate instruments in order to develop some kind of effective policy

As for the Eastern Dimension , I would like to draw particular attention to what are known as frozen conflicts , to the situation in Moldova and , in particular , to the

(PL) Madam President , Commissioner , I would like to begin by congratulating the authors of both reports and , in particular , the author of the report on the Eastern Dimension of Neighbourhood
They come from my sincere conviction that at last we have reports which show that European Neighbourhood Policy should , to a much greater extent , be based on values which ,

I would like to tell you about the scandalous events which have taken place this afternoon in Grodno in Belarus , where a journalist , Andrzej Poczobut , who is accused of

I would therefore like to propose that the first step the Commission could take is to give those countries in North Africa that have begun the journey towards democracy
In addition , we must not forget that the Mediterranean is turning into an immigration time bomb; this is another reason for us to support stability , democracy and growth in these

I welcome the accession of Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova to the Energy Community Treaty , which will make an important contribution to achieving the Union's energy security objectives
Madam President , I do support the European Neighbourhood Policy as a meaningful political framework for strengthening democracy in both the Eastern and Southern Dimensions , but I have now asked for
the floor in order to pose the following question to all of us: whether the European Union's moral right to show third countries the way towards real democracy is well
Both motions for resolutions recall such ENP values as democracy , the rule of law , and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the freedom of the media , the independence
Is the European Union itself a champion in all these fields , taking into account , for example , the situation of the media in Italy and Hungary , mass statelessness in Latvia
Also , the suggestion that we should have regular hearings , especially with civil society from undemocratic regimes , is a good one , so that they can hear what we have to say ,

Catherine Ashton , Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy , and I are both of the opinion that we could hardly

There are big changes with regard to external action with the substitution of the six months' Presidency and its priorities in external relations by the consistent and coherent policy
I know that there are a lot of challenges , questions and even criticisms here and there , but I am confident that these changes will deliver on a more coherent EU
So , they believe that their views were not being taken into account and that there was one scheme that was being applied to all , without taking the specificities into
It has offered us a mirror - which , I think , was very much needed - for asking important questions , such as how ready we are to complement the aspirations
of emerging democracies , how far we are ready to go to deal with the situations like the one we face in Libya , and how long we should make compromises here
Our communication of 8 March was an attempt to answer some of those questions - to be absolutely frank with you , the easy questions - because we have actually answered
They are also changing us and the way we react to the situation - the way in which we will proactively react and pursue these new phenomena in our

'The Council considers transparency as a principle of paramount importance for the European Union
openly as possible and that decisions shall be taken as openly and as closely as possible to the citizens
'In line with these provisions , the Council remains committed to giving the fullest possible effect to the principle of transparency
It also recognises that citizens expect that those who act on their behalf at the EU level respect the highest possible standards
'The Council therefore welcomes and supports the initiative undertaken by the European Parliament and the Commission to establish a joint "Transparency Register‚Äù

'The Council has received the invitation of the European Parliament and the Commission to join the Register
The Council is ready to consider having a role in the Register and looks forward to discuss the possible modalities with the two other institutions

It would be the best solution if all the European institutions were to have the same register for outside interests
Now I would like to invite my colleagues and the Vice-President of the Commission to join me in front of the podium for the signing of the document
For the official signing , I should like to welcome Minister Gy≈ëri and Maro≈° ≈†efƒçoviƒç , Vice-President of the European Commission , and our colleagues Diana Wallis , Vice-President of the European Parliament , who

The SET Plan can be effective and credible only if it is properly financed , and this includes finance from private sources

During the debate before the vote , I tabled a proposal that Cuba should be presented with an ultimatum
The embargo will be lifted and within six months all prisoners of conscience must be released and reforms must be introduced

Furthermore , the EU is aiming to set an example globally in saving resources and protecting the environment
These ambitious targets can only be achieved if the EU as a whole and each of the Member States individually make clear commitments to deadlines
Investments in low carbon energy technologies are key to meeting the targets proposed for 2020 , which is not as far away as it seems
Attaining these targets requires a considerable financial effort: EUR 58 billion , according to some meticulous calculations , from both public and private sources
opening up new prospects in the field of research , which has been unjustly underfunded for decades
The investments in developing low carbon energy sources will yield results in the medium and long term , making a positive impact across the whole European Union
It is vital to insist on a radical change in society based on the sustainability of cities , decentralised energy production and industrial competitiveness

The SET Plan intends to contribute specifically to the development of clean technologies

However , it is essential to increase public funding of scientific research in the area of clean technologies
Europe still has to create conditions for there to be more private investment in scientific research , in technological development and demonstration in the energy field
It is vital to move beyond words to action
The next EU financial perspective and the 8th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development should prioritise energy security , the fight against climate change and the environment
Only in this way will it be possible to maintain the competitiveness of our industry , promote economic growth and job creation

investment in research and more environmentally-friendly technologies so that we can maintain European competitiveness and allow job creation within a framework of an innovative and sustainable economy
I welcome the objectives of the SET Plan (Strategic Energy Technology Plan) , which insist on the development of a low-carbon society
The SET Plan seeks to accelerate the development and roll-out of low-carbon technologies
This plan includes measures relating to planning , implementation , resources and international cooperation in the area of innovative technologies in the energy sector
Several studies estimate that promoting the European target of 20% renewable energy penetration will result in millions of new jobs by 2020
Furthermore , roughly two thirds of these jobs will be created in small and medium-sized enterprises
The solution requires the development of green technologies
Therefore , we need more funding for the SET Plan , which I advocate should be provided in the next review of the financial perspective
We also need to promote green technologies and skilled labour through investment in education and research
The sooner we begin to achieve a low-carbon society , the sooner we will emerge from the crisis

'to promote world-wide carbon emission trading'
The use of low-carbon technologies which naturally produce less carbon dioxide is positive and desirable
However , we cannot accept that , at the expense of technological development and strengthening of the so-called SET Plan , yet another excuse is being sought to weaken national energy policies
the European Commission to weaken the sovereignty of Member States in such an important area as national energy strategies

Our group therefore voted against

- Mr President , Sustainable and effective low-carbon technologies are the core essentials in the huge task of decarbonisation we in the EU , and globally , are facing

If we are serious with our mission , it is evident that we need all forms of low-carbon technologies , including sustainable nuclear power

This recital may have had negative implications on the concept of 'sustainable low-carbon technologies' suggesting that nuclear is not part of that
The fact however is that we in the EU cannot afford not to use it if we want to take climate change seriously
Until renewable energies really can deliver effective results and secure constant energy flow , it is such low-carbon technologies which we must rely on
Investment in low-carbon technologies must be a priority , since it is one of the most effective ways to tackle climate change , preparing the EU for a green economy
Intelligent low-carbon solutions should therefore receive special attention , not least with regard to their Community funding , to achieve the environmental targets set by the EU for 2020

effects of the storm Xynthia in Europe
I believe that the European Union must show solidarity to those who suffer as a result of these natural disasters
They have hit regions in Portugal , western France , various regions in Spain , in particular the Canary Islands and Andalusia , as well as Belgium , Germany and the Netherlands
In western France the storm caused the death of roughly 60 people and the disappearance of a number of people , not to mention the destruction of several thousand homes
The European Commission can provide financial support to the affected regions through the European Union's Solidarity Fund
It is of paramount importance that there is a sense of solidarity between Member States in the event of major natural disasters
There must be coordination between the authorities at local , national and European level in their efforts to rebuild the affected areas
Effective prevention policies must not be overlooked either

The natural disaster that affected Madeira on 20 February has left a desolate scene , human suffering and widespread destruction , with devastating consequences for the respective economic and production structures
One week later , another natural disaster - storm Xynthia - had devastating consequences on a region in western France and several regions of Spain
I would like to join with the feeling of grief and express my solidarity with all those affected by this tragedy , in terms of both the human and material losses
It is vital to provide aid to people , as well as to rebuild infrastructure , public facilities and essential services
It is true that the Solidarity Fund can only be paid after the completion of the procedures to mobilise the Fund and the respective approval by the Council and Parliament
However , in the current situation , it is very difficult to ask people facing immense difficulties in resuming their normal way of life to wait
Therefore , we ask for the greatest urgency and flexibility both in making funds available and taking exceptional measures to help Madeira

I also voted in favour of the amendment supporting the proposal made by Mr Barnier in 2006 to create a European civil protection force
I regret that it has not been adopted; implementing this proposal would improve the EU's crisis response capacity
The recent natural tragedy that occurred on Madeira has left the island in a state of chaos
Other regions in Europe have been equally devastated by the impact of storm Xynthia
The EU should unreservedly help in a joint effort to express solidarity , mobilising the European Union Solidarity Fund for this purpose

citizens and guarantee them the best possible conditions for survival after a crisis
Our efforts , however , must not concentrate only on giving help after the event

In relation to this , the appropriate EU institutions must take specific steps to supervise the regions and their abilities to undertake preventative action

I would like to begin by expressing my solidarity with the families of the victims of the natural disasters in Madeira and of the victims of storm Xynthia

This is why we must ensure that the European Union is prepared to respond as quickly and efficiently as possible

Hand in hand with this there should be a strengthening of the role of the European Investment Bank in financing projects in the area of energy , and especially projects

The resolution by the European Parliament , the pretext for which is the death of the Cuban prisoner Orlando Zapata Tamayo , who died following a hunger strike , despite the efforts of

The development and implementation of low-carbon technologies is extremely important not only for environmental reasons - which include the need to reduce atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide - but also

(INI))] , and
objectives
This is indeed a very coherent package
regards the commitment required in connection with the EU 2020 strategy
agreement on a number of underlying matters
We are talking about the direction , and also about implementation in the near future
Take , for example , the flagship projects that will also require our joint support before long
It is really important , therefore , that we invest enough time in this now
Europe
The beauty of it is that we can do better; indeed we must do better
Our activities are rather fragmented in various fields - if we look at developments in the world , competition and the kind of things we want to tackle
To summarise: things must be made smarter , greener , more sustainable and more inclusive
The reports tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs also concern governance and ensuring sufficient financial resources , including for education
In short , it is my hope that , this afternoon , we shall lay clear foundations for this resolution
I do not know whether a vote will be held tomorrow , whether a consensus will be achieved on governance
In any case , however , I anticipate that Parliament will be able to adopt a final position on the EU 2020 strategy in June
Returning to my report: it is an implementation report
good result
What have we laid down
1
In Europe , we have first-class research
Yet what is lagging behind is the utilisation of this research
Knowledge is free; it travels around the world , and cannot be kept to oneself
production in this part of the world
2
My report notes that we are currently spending one quarter of regional funds on research infrastructure and innovation
That is a substantial change , a prioritisation that has been working in the current period thanks to Commission initiatives
Earmarking is among the instruments that have been effective and have also definitely influenced the agenda in the regions , towns and cities
It leads to a better profile in the knowledge-based economy into which we are evolving , and to greater specialisation
3
In my report , together with my fellow Members , I have made a series of proposals for improvements throughout the research/innovation/production chain with a view to greater effectiveness
We must also realise the importance of the territorial dimension laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon
principle of specialisation is an old one in the European Union - provided that good links exist for transmitting that knowledge (broadband or traditional infrastructure)
If the Union invests money , there should also be cooperation between the
(The President cut off the speaker)

on their debt
Unfortunately , no risk assessment can be carried out in the deeply uncertain context in which the global economy now finds itself
Such an assessment is all the more important in the European Union , where the production capacity utilisation rate is at an all-time low
Instead of investing , companies are mothballing machines because , despite the initial signs of recovery at the end of 2009 , demand is lacking
Growth would even end up going into reverse if restrictive measures were to nip the recovery in the bud
The first aim of our report was precisely to determine the optimum time for launching policies for emerging from the crisis
We proposed maintaining the support measures until the normal production capacity utilisation rate was restored
line with the spirit of the reform of the 2005 Stability Pact
to borrow the resources necessary for stimulus packages at the bottom of the cycle
We are currently at the bottom of the cycle
Interest rates are definitely under pressure and are threatening the sustainability of the debt
This being the case , the European Central Bank was right to announce that it would buy back some debt to enable Member States to diversify their sources of finance
Nevertheless , in addition to the fact that this concept of sustainability has never been defined in the economic literature , can the risk premiums demanded by the markets be deemed justifiable
No , if we consider that risk in the mortgage derivatives market , just as in the public-debt market , is impossible to assess
This is why , in our report , we proposed that particular attention be paid to the structural deficit indicator rather than the focus being
(The President cut off the speaker)
of which is due to the deterioration in the actual budget deficit
This is the result of the crisis , which has weakened growth and concomitant tax revenue
This revenue has also been adversely affected by the lowering of taxes , which did not have the expected impact on supply
Our report seeks to offer three recommendations combined with some operational indicators
The first is to maintain support measures until the recovery has been consolidated
the markets as to the state of public finances
The third is to assess the efficiency of tax expenditure and , in particular , of certain tax reductions which are related to the fall in tax revenue
fact that the massive debt is also due to the bank bail-out plans counts for little
Only their blind faith in the efficiency of the financial markets counts; only dogmatic compliance with a manifestly out-of-date Stability Pact counts
They do not see any need to create the tools required for economic governance , which is essential in order to strengthen the Union
risk of destroying the recovery , and too bad for social cohesion
That is the position that they have defended in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs
Since that vote , the economic health of Europe has deteriorated further
The European Central Bank and the Commission have finally come up with monetary and budgetary instruments which should enable us to improve economic governance in the euro area
However , the markets have fallen once again , unsettled as they are by the austerity plans
The Ecofin Council had to start all over again on Monday
Against this background , the amendments which we are tabling are , all in all , very moderate; and we are tabling some new ones too
They argue for flexible implementation of the Stability Pact , so that an unwelcome austerity cure can be avoided
They advocate a public credit rating agency to shield Member States from the diktat of the markets
These are the signals that Parliament must send out
Mr Karas , the time for ideological knee-jerk reactions has passed , as has the time for short-term national electoral moves
Europe needs policies which are motivated by a real desire to strengthen the Union

The report was approved practically unanimously by the Committee on Regional Development: 40 votes in favour , 1 abstention and 1 vote against
regional and local authorities , of the social , economic and civil society actors in the Lisbon Strategy , which made its adoption , communication and effectiveness difficult
The report also calls for the need for assessments , not only of the actual expenditure , but of the real impact as well

Thus , a certain flexibility should be allowed for
Strategic Reference Frameworks and the National Reform Programmes , as well as greater coordination and coherence between the different European , national and regional policies linked to strategy objectives
medium-sized enterprises

comprehensive agreement which is inclusive of all Member States and which focuses primarily on the priorities that the Member States are truly willing to take on
interests , by the consumers by defending their rights , and by small and medium enterprises by providing them with the right incentives
My report proposes a series of strategic legislative and non-legislative initiatives , geared towards the rehabilitation of the European Single Market
These initiatives reach their pinnacle in the creation of the Single Market Act , which combines immediate action (2012) together with the long term vision of the 2020 strategy
I have also put forward specific non-legislative proposals on the drawing up of the citizens' charter which lays down their rights and what they are entitled to
the creation of a collective remedy mechanism and on a communication strategy specifically targeted at every day problems experienced by our citizens
tasks to be undertaken by the European Union
Only in this way can we achieve a truly social market economy as is stipulated in the Treaty of Lisbon
Unfortunately , in the past years , the Single Market has not managed to convince our citizens that it represents their interests and aspirations
What is even more alarming is that our citizens and consumers are experiencing an increasing sense of uncertainty and lack of faith in the Market
We need to come to terms with the fact that the traditional definition of the Single Market as something solely tied to the economic dimension needs to be revamped
We need to come up with a new common line which is holistic and which fully integrates the sentiments of our citizens , consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises
This can be done by offering them a leading part in the re-launch of the European Single Market
we must face up to
The Single Market integration process is not an irreversible one
Its current situation needs to be challenged
The European Single Market is in danger of becoming extremely weak and therefore irrelevant due to the protectionist attitudes that the crisis brought along with it
so that , as Evelyne Gebhardt said , 'the Single Market works for the citizens and not against them
'
integration and social objectives
provides consumer protection as well as social and environmental safeguards required by our citizens
All this needs to be achieved within a spirit of compromise and solidarity
Finally Mr President , I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and coordinators for their contributions
Mr President , Commissioner , firstly , I do nonetheless wonder for a moment about our programming and our ability to organise our debates
not sure offers an exact definition of the European Parliament's vision for the EU 2020 strategy
Perhaps I am being too demanding , though
10 May , which relates to the following
to grant the European Parliament the right to exercise its powers under the Treaty of Lisbon itself
Clearly , neither the Commission nor the Council has any intention of considering this request and they therefore consciously intend to violate the treaty
I think that the authorities in this House will have to shoulder their responsibilities and learn lessons from this
from even before the start of the crisis - and when 23 million of our fellow citizens are going to end up unemployed
There is currently great concern within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs about two issues
Firstly , about the poverty reduction target , which I think was the initiative of Commissioner Andor; this target was included in the 2020 strategy , and we welcome that
clearly indicates that this is an area in which the EU also has responsibilities
since it has reduced the number of targets
I believe that fundamental change must be about much more than simply reducing the number of targets
However , what we are convinced about is that the 2020 strategy must take account of the reality of the situation in the EU
the EU's wealth
just when it is needed the most , in other words , in our long-term capital: education , training and health
fields , at the very time when weak growth and reduced private investment cannot take up the slack and , therefore , ensure the recovery of public finances in the short term

programmes for young people , modernise labour markets , boost labour mobility and develop skills and competences to increase labour market participation
in early school leavers and increased participation of youth , older workers and low-skilled workers in the labour market
However , the global economic crisis has led to budget cuts in the education sector in Member States across the European Union
the higher-education budget
to EUR 500 million from higher education
This is not all doom and gloom
Some Member States , such as France , have been doing well , but the problem is that there is a divergent level of funding across Member States
In order for the EU 2020 strategy to work , we need a strong , coordinated approach
and , secondly , how it intends to secure extra budgetary means for these important EU-level strategies and programmes
participating - on the other oral questions which affect other sectors: cohesion , employment , the social dimension , research and development
need to coordinate our countries' economic policies
This is the time to respond and to act and , as far as possible , together , in this context of uncertainty and crisis
The decisions taken over the last few days are - we think - very important
I will not go back over the long debate which was held this morning with my colleague , Commissioner Rehn
first instrument of a new , strengthened and coordinated economic policy
In its proposal concerning this strategy , the Commission had already emphasised , at the beginning of March , the need to stabilise our public finances
The euro crisis which we have just been through proves to us just how relevant this position still is
Like my colleague , Commissioner Rehn , I have taken note of the proposals in Mr Hoang Ngoc's report on these issues
Moving on , there is , ladies and gentlemen , a second preliminary requirement for the success of 2020 , which is putting our economy , our economies on a sound or improved footing
I am , of course , thinking about the need to supervise and regulate the financial market , so that it serves the real economy and not the other way around
I promise you that the Commission will keep to its roadmap in these areas
on four major issues: transparency , responsibility , supervision and crisis prevention
overcome their differences with regard to the texts under discussion
I am thinking about the 'financial supervision' package and the hedge funds document
We must restore confidence
We must also utilise every single resource to free up the growth potential of our economy
This work clearly comprises many aspects
outermost regions , cohesion , economic governance , the viability of public finances , employment , education and research
When we talk about Europe 2020 , what are we talking about
even certain instances of competition in the future
and long terms
energy and climate change
Finally , there is also the promotion of social inclusion by combating poverty
Quantified indicators for education and social inclusion will have to be set at the June European Council
Work on these two objectives is in progress in various forums of the Council
It is very important to clearly understand that the 2020 strategy is not merely a vision
It is , above all , a concrete programme of reforms to be implemented , and that is why we are proposing seven flagship initiatives as part of this strategy
In addition to these flagship initiatives , European instruments , in particular the single market , financial levers and foreign policy instruments will also be mobilised to eliminate certain obstacles
giving a humanist and more concrete dimension to the internal market , as I myself should like to do
There are also certain requirements where implementation is concerned
Therefore , more efficient governance mechanisms have been proposed , which require the involvement of the Member States , as well as the Commission , at every level of the monitoring process
Europe 2020 also means adopting reforms to be implemented within the Member States themselves
showing respect for the Stability and Growth Pact
Mr Hoang Ngoc , I should like , if I may , to point out that this pact has been supported for about 10 years now by both left- and right-wing governments
Finally , the Commission is calling on the European Parliament to do what it does so well and play a still greater role in this new strategy
During a crisis , we wish to send out clear messages to the Member States
This is the purpose of the integrated guidelines proposed by the Commission
These will only be adopted once you have tabled your opinions
However , bearing in mind the urgency of the situation , we must implement this strategy
We must aim for a political agreement at the European Council meeting in June
Let us be clear , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen: in the rest of the world , socio-economic strategies are already being implemented for the medium term
Europe cannot be left behind
European Parliament
There are other examples , and this is a very important undertaking
to build , with you , this new , higher quality , more sustainable and fairer growth , which the citizens expect
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets
- (BG) Mr President , Commissioners , if we were discussing the Europe 2020 strategy without the economic crisis having occurred , everything would be fine
The problem is that in the current crisis and after what has happened , the Europe 2020 strategy is not ambitious and dynamic enough
in European policies , for the European Union to make progress
From what we see , this coordination is good at a time of growth , but during a crisis it is not up to requirements
play a much more leading role in this coordination
This is the fundamental question to be answered
If we fail to do so , we will not be able to set out the 2020 programme properly either
I think that in the coming weeks , we ought to focus mainly on this issue
because it is essential that we do not play off regional policy against the internal market
Instead , we should ensure that the one complements the other and that both of them are strong so that we can achieve the objectives of Europe 2020
Europe 2020 must begin here and now and should not be just a catalogue of objectives
this can be successfully implemented
the United States of Europe
To think in those terms and with each of us making a contribution to the whole
Europe 2020 means the willingness to bring about a political union
Europe and break through borders
We have to create an economic union which is part of a political union , as well as a social union
None of these things are ready and there is a great deal that has not even been addressed
Europe 2020 is a community Union , not a nationalist or obstructive Europe
the freedoms of education , science , research and innovation in Europe
(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))
of the peoples of Europe or without the consent of the peoples of Europe
order to further develop Europe and make it more competitive and to achieve growth and employment for the benefit of Europe's citizens
increasing globalisation
The citizens are our most important allies in achieving our joint objectives
Mr President , the Europe that we are taking decisions about today is also the one that decides how Europe will look in 2020
The decisions that we are refusing to take today will lead to new crises
The decisions that we take today must be long-term decisions
diet
markets
at present
markets and we make major investments in those things that are for the good of everyone
the Commission must act
I also hope that the Commission is ready to table proposals that show that we take the transition to a sustainable society seriously
We will , in other words , restructure our industry so that it is competitive and can create new jobs
We cannot do this by convincing ourselves that we can keep following the same old tracks
This also requires investment , but it may make an impact on the current figure of 28 million registered unemployed
to build a stronger and better society
For us to be able to master this crisis , we need trade union rights and we need Europe's workers to be made into stakeholders
on behalf of the ALDE Group
- Mr President , I used to say that we had a triple crisis in Europe with financial markets , jobs and climate
But now , sadly , we have a quadruple crisis if we add the state budget crisis
It has made it painfully clear that the European Union is in dire need of vision
European integration has , until now , focused on creating new projects without making sure that they work properly
I believe that the time has now come for us to deal with our problems and instead work hard to deepen the existing institutions
The mistakes that have been made can be corrected and the Union can still work for - and with - its citizens
Europe needs a forward-looking Union
For me , the direction is clear: I want a Europe which is open , inclusive and green
The flagship proposals in the Commission's Europe 2020 strategy are important tools to create that Europe , provided that we can make them come true
And here I have some question marks
Firstly , the overarching goal of the strategy is to create a more dynamic and competitive economy
In some countries , the participation of women in the labour market is as low as 40% , and this is shameful
A gender-equal labour market is a precondition for boosting jobs and for tackling the demographic challenges
I hope that the Council and Commission really take seriously the fact that the Council's conclusions have included gender equality for a couple of months
An inclusive society needs more jobs
Unemployment is the main reason why poverty exists
Youth unemployment in Spain , at 44% , is devastating
We have endless opportunities to create green jobs , but our policies must be aimed in the same direction
An energy-efficient Europe is also a driving force of innovation , and the energy equivalent of fast trains , supergrids and high-tech smart grids is needed to improve Europe's competitiveness
the same kind of in-depth material on the rest of the flagship platforms before June , so that we can also cooperate in the decision making
But , Mr Commissioner , we have the EU strategy pointing in one direction , and your budget proposal is , to be truthful , pointing in another direction
As well as regional funds , social funds and the agricultural fund , we have to streamline and have coherence in our common tools
to keep them
This is important for the European citizens and for us in Parliament
We need to strengthen the Growth and Stability Pact , and we fully support the package of Commissioner Olli Rehn
To re-establish trust , as you mentioned , Commissioner , we need the indicators on the rest of the flagship proposals
That would re-establish our trust in you as a Commission , and maybe , if we can cooperate on decision making , citizens' trust in us
Mr President , Mr Barnier , in your speech you mentioned Mr Monti's report , which was submitted to you a few days ago
of fiscal cooperation
will almost certainly lead to a recession
activities and economic operators whose tax burden has been repeatedly reduced over the last few years: the profits from companies , capital , and financial transactions
To do this , we absolutely must have European coordination
This is the conclusion reached in Mr Monti's report , which was submitted two days ago
However , there is no mention whatsoever of this issue in the EU 2020 strategy presented by the Commission
There is no mention whatsoever of this issue in Mr Rehn's communication published a few days ago
This is one of the major pillars , one of the fundamental added values which the Commission can provide at the present time
the link between the EU 2020 strategy , the report on the governance of the euro area , on the single market , and employment and education issues
then we are on course for social regression and economic recession
Therefore , my question is very clear: Mr Barnier , as a representative of the Commission , what are you going to place on the table over the coming weeks
so that Member States are able once more to raise new revenues on the basis of a number of agreements
What are your proposals
You are not entitled to stay silent
The Commission has a right to initiate legislation , but , today , on these issues , that right has become a duty
on behalf of the ECR Group
was the shadow rapporteur in the committee
this afternoon
But , on the other hand , it is rather an unfocused debate
2020 document
It has lots of great ideas but it is very unfocused and it is also very underdeveloped at this stage
He talked about the seven flagship initiatives
Well , we do not know the details of those yet
not ready to be adopted
We need to spend more time on it together to work through the details
My second point is that I think we need to make the relaunch of the single market an eighth flagship initiative
That will not be overcomplicating things because it ought to be the number one initiative
to get the support of citizens and consumers for this proposal
It was like the question addressed to Mr Karas just now by the Earl of Dartmouth
Citizens need to buy into that process , but it is there for them to do
They will get the benefits
to drive innovation , to buy those new technologies , to encourage SMEs to take those up
It is the biggest single underdeveloped policy that we have
We heard from Mr Barnier and Mr Grech today , and we made a contribution with Mr Monti's report
We have the instruments , but we need to carry them out
taken at government level
The European Parliament has been allowed to sit on the sidelines but no more than that
about the future of Europe and the course of its further development
are not allowed to bring our demands to bear on this strategy and change it , make up for shortfalls or , perhaps , even change the priorities
caught up in the power play between the institutions in spite of , or perhaps even because of , the Treaty of Lisbon
This has mainly been to the detriment of the European Parliament
merely to be informed or consulted
Also , all the individual reports tabled here today far from present an overall view of the demands or the positions of the European Parliament regarding the European strategy
We want to introduce a whole raft of specific changes
EU-wide poverty-proof minimum wage
None of that has been incorporated into the strategy
strategy text because they do not accord with the skill and the interests of the Member States or the governments
Even the EU's employment record over the past ten years has clearly shown that atypical and precarious jobs , in particular , have risen to 60%
jobs
Now , that is a fundamental demand which we are dealing with here
a future-proof project
That is a democratic deficit which the current EU 2020 strategy does nothing to address and we should be fighting it together with our citizens
The problems experienced by Greece and the euro area make for a serious situation , which calls for a structural approach
The proposed EU 2020 strategy aiming to contribute to economic growth and employment seeks to provide this
The strategy rightly covers healthy public finances
However , the initiative will be useful only if two conditions are met
Firstly , the functioning of the Stability and Growth Pact needs to be strengthened so that this kind of situation does not recur
It is not just a matter of structures and rules , then , but of mentality
The crucial point is that Member States meet their budgetary commitments , as I pointed out during a conference in Athens last week
finances back in order
As far as I am concerned , strengthening of economic coordination ought to cover this
The second condition I wish to draw attention to is the undesirability of the European Union turning its attention to the policy fields of social affairs , employment and social cohesion
Objectives in those fields cannot be enforced at European level; and rightly so
We saw in the case of the Lisbon Strategy that such an approach does not work
Here , too , it is true that it is in restraint that the master is revealed; the European master
(NL) Today , we are discussing Europe's economy from a long-term perspective , and how to achieve sustainable economic growth
When Europe discusses this , I do not sleep as easily , as Europe has not proposed a great deal up to now
I would remind the House of the Lisbon Strategy , in which Europe agreed to become the most competitive economy in the world
That proved to be a complete failure , of course
a lack of security
- all poor countries , Muslim countries , and corrupt and criminal to boot - and Iceland - a bankrupt state
in subsidies for wind turbines and green electricity , even though our industry is becoming increasingly less competitive in relation to China , the United States and India
Are you surprised that our economy is stagnating
cuts instead of tax increases; and putting a stop to mass immigration
Greece clearly must be expelled from the euro area
under the Stability and Growth Pact
I already know your answer: absolutely nothing
of hand
If Europe does not succeed in this , I predict that my country , the Netherlands - and also Germany - will leave the euro area
Mr President , the financial support package that was presented almost two weeks ago was a necessity , but not a solution to the problems that Europe is facing
Now there is a need for action , for decisions and for restored confidence in public finances
order to restore growth , reduce deficits and create optimism
But there will be none of the growth which is needed without restored confidence in public finances
On this point , the Socialists are failing
They are defending the same policies that led to the deficits and the crisis of Greece , Spain and Portugal and other countries
The rapporteur , Mr Hoang Ngoc , is saying that we should prolong those policies and that we should wait before reducing the deficits
Mrs Ulvskog from Sweden proposes increased spending
The Socialists have become a threat to prosperity , recovery and the new jobs that Europe needs
reforms for growth and new jobs
That is what Europe will need , and we will stand there and take the tough decisions and take the responsibilities where others fail
are experiencing at present
They are not waiting on the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)
No , Sir
They are hoping for a real political change , such as that which can be brought about by the 2020 strategy
If our analysis is faulty , our solutions will likewise be faulty
and cohesive population , from a lack of social justice , from low economic growth , from low employment growth and from having enormous groups of poorly skilled people outside the job market
terms , to win the productivity battle
Europe will not gain in competitiveness without winning the productivity battle
solidarity and social cohesion in our society
These are our strong points
of today , but also to the challenges of tomorrow
These are our hopes
those who want to return the 'every man for himself' idea , thus destroying solidarity with all
economic governance and tax consolidation
Tax consolidation is fine , but there must also be social and economic consolidation , otherwise we will not achieve anything
the excesses that have led to the crisis
about how we can achieve prosperity and growth
What determines our growth
Our growth and prosperity depend on people in the European Union developing products and generating new ideas that can also be sold on the global market
It is therefore right that one chapter in the EU 2020 strategy is Innovation Union
We need to focus on inventions and on how we can reinforce research and development
With that , it is important that we enhance the synergies of research funding and regional development policy
A great deal more could be done in those areas
Together with the Liberals and the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) , I would argue that we focus on small and medium-sized enterprises
transfer between universities and colleges and SMEs
We should encourage people to take their destinies into their own hands through personal responsibility and self-initiative
Governments cannot create jobs; they need to be created in the economy itself
the EU's economic successes at risk
However , what is missing in the Europe 2020 strategy is a link between environmental change in the economy and a green employment strategy
There are studies which have shown that 8 million new jobs can be created through the energy transition alone
In the Europe 2020 strategy , we therefore need an initiative for green jobs
This initiative must be reflected in specific measures and integrated guidelines
Therefore , we need stable legal and political frameworks , so that investors really do invest in green jobs
That equally includes establishing links between research and development and the economy , the promotion of innovation clusters and also the opportunity to promote such clusters in disadvantaged regions
That is what the van Nistelrooij report states and I endorse it
the proposals made are nevertheless heading in the right direction and will contribute to the creation of green jobs
transition
I address those words to Commissioner Andor
Fundamentally , the structure of the employment policy guidelines presented is right and balanced
Of particular importance is the fact that education has been emphasised as an independent area of focus
This area offers great opportunities for breaking the cycle of poverty
It forms a cornerstone for a green employment strategy and is thereby key to the success of the Europe 2020 strategy
However , we also to need to improve the guidelines
The employment guidelines have a key role to play and that is to enable us to really exploit the potential of green jobs
(PL) Very different conclusions can be drawn from Europe's slow economic growth and the collapse caused by the crisis
Member States , but also by the European Union and by this Parliament
However , there is the risk of applying a treatment which is much worse than the disease
tax harmonisation which would follow
Tax competition , like every kind of competition , is good for the citizens and the markets
It creates the chance for a better result , and is an important factor in our competitiveness at global level
Therefore , common freedoms and a common market , and not extending Union competences , should be the central principle of the Union's economic policy
parts of the world and in which scandalous profits continue to be made without any measures being taken to check them
million unemployed
We want to talk about the elderly people who are being denied a decent retirement and the children whose futures are being mortgaged
Let us be clear: what is being proposed in the Europe 2020 strategy is the same path as was there at the start of the crisis
in applying the Lisbon Strategy: the liberalisation of economic sectors , including financial services , and the labour flexibility that it called flexicurity
and attacks on public services that interest economic groups in areas of health , social security , and education; anything that could turn a profit
They prefer to hide the fact that only a break from these policies will allow a change of course and that only this can bring social progress
Nevertheless , we insist on this break and say that it is time to drop the Stability Pact and replace it with a programme of social development and progress
This programme must prioritise production , quality public services , the creation of jobs with rights , salaries , decent pensions and retirement conditions , social inclusion , and fair wealth division and distribution
economy by the state
struggle
Mr President , doubtless the 2020 strategy says lots of interesting things , but , under enlargement , by 2020 , five new countries will have joined the EU and more likely eight
Already in the EU of 2010 , 12 countries are net contributors to the EU
The other 15 Member States are subsidised
None of the new countries are likely to be contributors
In 2020 , therefore , there are likely to be no less than 23 countries being subsidised
By 2020 , therefore , the EU will have become , in practice , a transfer union , which transfers money from 12 contributing countries to 23 subsidised countries
Unfortunately and unfairly , the UK taxpayer is caught up in this
The comparatively impoverished UK is the second largest contributor to the EU budget
At the last provincial elections in Germany , the voters of North Rhine-Westphalia said 'no' to their coalition and were also saying 'no' to the transfer union
Voters in other contributing countries will also say 'no' in the next 10 years
By 2020 , the gap will be unbridgeable
It is not in the UK's national interest for there to be economic chaos across the channel but , unless enlargement stops forthwith , economic chaos is what there will be
The 2020 strategy , therefore , misses the point
(HU) Ladies and gentlemen , I respectfully wish to ask whether you do not think that there is something incredibly bizarre in what is going on here
For an extremely important debate on the financial and economic crisis that is the cause of tragedy among many millions of Europeans , only some 40 people are present
the cameras show it , the waste of energy in lighting a chamber the size of a stadium where no more than 40 people are present except at voting time
In the 27 interpreters' booths , there are 27x3 , which makes 81 highly qualified simultaneous interpreters , translating for us
For 40 MEPs , that makes two interpreters per person
Do we not think that it is time to look in the mirror and stop urging pensioners , fire-fighters , nurses and teachers to keep tightening their belts
(PL) In times of crisis , when the integrity of the European Union is under threat , we should , in supporting economic growth , pay particular attention to the cohesion of the Union
We still do not know if the crisis will act to deepen the differences between different regions of Europe
Historical differences in the level of development of regions may grow , and we may also witness the appearance of new differentiating factors
In this situation , what is particularly needed are mechanisms which reduce differences between regions , and continuation of strong regional policy is the way to achieve this objective
threat to the stimulation of economic growth , but would also be a threat to European unity as such
Both the Europe 2020 strategy and Cohesion policy aim to achieve the same goal
They have a crucial effect on economic revival and huge significance for European solidarity policy
However , what is needed is better coordination between them
condemn it to the fate of the Treaty of Lisbon
We must ensure the financing of key infrastructure projects and reject the renationalisation of regional policy
At the moment , we often hear of strong pressure from governments of certain Member States and also from the European Commission to cut or reduce expenditure on regional policy
However , the message of the European Parliament in the report , of which I was shadow rapporteur , is clear
We need stronger , not weaker , Cohesion policy
We need true European solidarity
from which to move forward
Thank you also for using a phrase which I myself use all the time , namely that the economy is there for the people and not the other way around
That is precisely what the policy of the European Union should be based on
in the internal market , are of particular importance
That is precisely what has been missing so far or what has not been made sufficiently visible to our citizens
It is a very important approach to point out the actual humanist and holistic elements of our policy , even when it comes to the internal market
market policy and that protecting services of a general economic interest is of particular importance
In addition , you call for the development of a strategy for improved communication of the social advantages of the internal market
If we consider just these few points , we realise that we could achieve a great deal if only the European Commission gave us its backing
I also very much hope that the Commission will genuinely take the opportunity presented by the Grech report to put the progress of EU citizens centre stage
I make that plea very strongly and , as we know , Mr Barnier has already agreed to do so
better future
that consumers must not be left out of this future strategy
When I look at the Commission's text on the 2020 strategy , I note that virtually no mention is made of consumers
In the current crisis , you must remember that , while investment is , of course , the key variable , consumption in our various countries represents between 60 and 70% of our GDP
I would therefore like us to move further in this direction in the 2020 strategy
sake
I would love to see a kind of enhanced competition which does not encourage 'discounting for discounting's sake' but which serves to ensure greater consumer satisfaction
Commissioner , my question is therefore very simple
we so desperately need
(DA) Mr President , I would like to take some time to talk about the social and employment aspects of EU 2020 and the Commission's efforts in this connection
currently on the table , with a genuine desire to define how Europe is to support itself in future and with a desire to set high social and employment targets
However , right now we have a situation in which the Member States had no intention of developing the plan that the Commission put forward
Instead they are moving backwards
Firstly , with regard to combating poverty: many Member States have questioned whether the EU actually has the competence to combat poverty and to set specific poverty targets
the Treaty on European Union and Articles 9 and 153 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union
It is therefore simply a matter of getting started
Secondly , other Member States , including my own , Denmark , have criticised the definition of poverty
Of course we need to come up with a good definition
However , these arguments cannot hide the fact that this is about one thing: whether we actually want to combat poverty in Europe
That is what the real debate is about
Do we want to reduce the number of poor people in Europe , which currently stands at 84 million
Do we want to reduce the number of poor workers , of which there are nearly 17 million
Do we not only want everyone to have jobs , but to also have good and proper jobs
Do we want young people to have access to the labour market
Yes , of course we do , and that is precisely why we need specific objectives with regard to social matters and in the area of employment
targets in these areas
If we do not have the courage to do this now , it will undermine the economic situation in Europe , as well as our social cohesion
Therefore , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , I would say to you that it is the political will that will be crucial
I hope that Parliament and the Commission will take the lead and urge those Member States that are hesitating to instead commit to a social Europe in 2020
I hope that , as Commissioners , you are prepared to do this
(CS) We have spent the entire day discussing a desirable strategic focus for the European Union
and local councillors
In this regard , it is a great disappointment to me that the role of local authorities is not sufficiently reflected in the EU 2020 strategy
The strategy correctly mentions the need for greater links to regional and local partners , but it is not clear how the principle of partnership should be applied in practice
Moreover , the consultation process is voluntary , so it is not in any way binding on the decision making of the Member States
I can confirm this with one concrete example
but the Federation did not even receive a proper response on how the comments were handled
all of the Member States and whose role is key to the fulfilment of any European policy
On the contrary , mandatory consultation with the actors 'below' would contribute vital findings on the correct , efficient and effective implementation of adopted measures
I would therefore like to call on the Commission to monitor thoroughly the method of linking local authorities in to the whole process
(EL) Mr President , the current Lisbon Strategy has simply been renamed Europe 2020 strategy
has shown that the standard of living of the citizens of the European Union has slipped
Despite this , the proposals tabled by the Commission do not include sufficiently social criteria
We therefore ask: what measure does the Commission propose in order to prevent unaccountability of the market , redundancies at will and the extension of insecurity to labour
Does the involvement of the International Monetary Fund not mean more onerous terms for the Member States and people
sacrifices will be needed
(FI) Mr President , when I was studying at the University of Helsinki in the 1980s , the Soviet Union was still going strong
When there were problems there , they called for more socialism
Now I am the middleaged father of a family here in the European Union , and when there are problems here , we call for greater integration
This philosophy is astonishingly similar and the outcome , too , will be the same: it will not work
Let us build on a foundation of nation states
For that , we have to bake our bread before we distribute it , as we say in Finland
Let us create jobs and the right conditions
That will be the source of our strength
That is how we will make progress
We have a shortage of employers - not a shortage of employees , but of employers , who can provide people with work
Small enterprises are crucial
We should postpone the debate on the owner drivers' working time directive until the next partsession
That is a typical example of a situation where we should be speaking up for independent entrepreneurs , who create jobs , who do good and who employ people
There is a danger now , however , that we will lose jobs on account of administrative decisions
I really love Europe , even if I do not love the European Union
possible to have a good game of football if you have got a referee overseeing each player
However , conducting a game without rules , without a referee and without penalising fouls , now that would end in chaos
That is precisely the state of affairs right now
It is high time that the Europe 2020 strategy put a stop to hedge fund speculators
Those who have made a nice living from speculation and exorbitant interest rates for years should now make a contribution
Not small savers , but companies with their high speculative profits should be asked to foot the bill
Nor should the Cohesion policy ignore the euro crisis
Apart from the current rescue package , Greece has benefited disproportionately in the past from agricultural and regional funding
Without the necessary structural changes , this money has clearly seeped away and , despite years of funding , the country has been brought to the brink of ruin
I do not see why we should leave the money tap on in such a situation
Why do we not listen to Commissioner Rehn who has made the rather reasonable proposal that we cut funding
Finally , we cannot allow the EU to degenerate into a union of transfers
A centrally planned economy , which is what some of you would like to see , has not proved its worth yet , even if it comes from Brussels
What is needed then
A self-responsible budgetary policy , and if it does not work , courageous and effective sanction mechanisms
All of that should be included in the Europe 2020 strategy
and to avoid the undermining of our single currency
The urgency of the situation justifies the practical approach adopted
in appropriate conditions
Indeed , we must ensure that our fellow citizens do not lose confidence , and can regain confidence , in the political institutions
Without such confidence , no structural reform or acceptance of the necessary austerity measures will be possible
Faced with the financial crisis , Europe has not been inactive
We do not say this often enough
In 2009 , we drew up and adopted regulations on the credit rating agencies , the implementing provisions of which will be published very shortly by the Commission
Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted a few days ago for the package on the supervision of financial activities
Last Monday , the same committee adopted the report on regulation of hedge fund managers by a large majority
Trialogues have been initiated to seek an agreement with the Council
This agreement must be obtained rapidly , so that our institutions retain their credibility
Our fellow citizens often ask us: 'What is Europe doing
' We must meet their expectations
with the undertakings made at your hearing
Your ambitious but essential timetable has our support
We will stand shoulder to shoulder with you so that the necessary regulation of financial services takes place
transactions more secure and transparent
(HU) Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , two great tasks face Europe today: designing a new strategy , which we are currently debating and which I feel is taking shape nicely
However , Europe is at a turning point if it does not find a new modus operandi
States , and especially Mrs Merkel , have been late in responding to this situation - mean that Europe is at a turning point
communitarianism
If we do not move towards communitarianism , the programme outlined by Mr Barnier will not be implemented and is worthless
at Commissioner Andor , about renewing the European social model
We are at a turning point , fellow Members
The past few weeks have proven this to be the case: the previous model does not work and the current model does not work properly
I am in favour of the Commission monitoring national budgets before they are submitted to the Member States' parliaments
(SV) Mr President , my contribution concerns Mr Hoang Ngoc's report on sustainable finances within the public sector
It has been a very interesting report to work on
The situation was - and the rapporteur's speech made this clear , too - that , from an ideological point of view , we had quite differing views on this question
before
The crisis is largely due to a failure on the part of Member States to look after their own finances and to keep their own house in order
countries have done in recent years
As I say , there were quite major differences on these issues , something that we have also seen in the Chamber
Fortunately , a very broad majority in the committee was also of the opinion that there was a need for tougher measures to remedy the situation we find ourselves in
The Commission has brought forward very good proposals in recent weeks
A start has finally now been made on taking decisions that will actually lead to us getting order back into Europe's economy
That is exactly what we need
That is why the discussions in the committee were exciting , to say the least
on
This was an important report , and I think we made positive amendments to it
I am convinced that the decision this House reaches will be a sound one
(NL) The present discussion on this crisis has mainly covered budgetary discipline; and rightly so , as it is important
It is not the whole story , though
Let us also keep this crisis in the right perspective , which is that we are actually still talking about a banking crisis
For many years , the banks made money out of thin air using opaque structures and , in 2008 , this bubble burst
Countries then transformed that private debt into public debt , and this is the problem Greece is having to contend with now: an unbearable level of public debt
In the light of this , when we discuss a 2020 strategy , we must also look at the role of the banks
The Commission has a total lack of ambition in this regard
Hardly a word has been said about the banks
What this crisis has shown is that a clear distinction must be made between savings banks and investment banks
Where is the Commission's ambition when it comes to plans for tackling this
That was my first point
However , we must also look at the economy of the future
The economy of the future will make efficient use of its natural resources
Here , too , the Commission has too little ambition
Either its objectives are too vague or its targets too low; for example , a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions , which is woefully inadequate to promote green innovation
How are companies to get the message that they should invest in green technology
We feel the Commission's plans should cover this , too
Finally , with regard to our own budget , this , too , must be in line with our own strategy
This means that the Structural Funds must ultimately be used to promote new green technology
At the moment , we are mainly subsidising more greenhouse gas emissions
Where is the money for innovation , and where are the appropriations for sustainable agriculture in the agricultural budget
We need the Commission to be specific and ambitious rather than producing vague plans; these are not the way to solve this crisis
Mr President , the central component of EU 2020 should not be stabilisation funds and bailouts
It should be a new strategy that all of our countries should want to follow to re-launch and re-energise the internal market of the EU
We need to be looking at how to change our economies so that they are fit for those challenges
The only way forward is to look at new industries via research , development and innovation
and services , looking at new processes and technologies and new business concepts
We should be looking at existing successful projects and using EU links to find best practice
In my own constituency , I visited Glynd≈µr University , which has fostered direct links with hi-tech firms in North Wales , achieving a 90% graduate placement , even last year
It has not just improved the job prospects of the young people who attend , but it has revitalised an entire region of North Wales
Instead of looking at the billion-dollar projects and silver-bullet solutions , we need to get back to the nuts and bolts of what makes a successful economy
South Wales has five significant pharmaceutical development companies with world-class technology
brighter future
We need solutions to work effectively for our citizens
out of steam
markets
Yet liberal Europe's project and activities have also run out of steam , and spectacularly so
With the successive crises , the last of which was the deepest of all , public debt has exploded
Worse still , however , the credibility of the euro area has gone up in smoke
The situation calls for real solidarity
However , the Treaty of Maastricht rules out any solidarity between countries in the euro area
This is the ultimate European paradox
us from globalisation
Far from being our shield and protection , EU directives have frequently stolen a march on the WTO
relocation
For the sake of the peoples , EU policy must be urgently refocused
(IT) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , EUR 308 billion is the total amount of the funds earmarked for implementing Cohesion policy for the period 2007-2013
To date , Europe has spent , and judging by the results , wasted , some of these priority funds established by Lisbon
types of intervention are needed: simplification and review
potential
As for review , this is urgently needed in order to change the criteria defining how the funds are allocated , by rethinking the general spirit underlying Cohesion policy
our territory and , in Brussels , formulating its long-awaited response regarding the future of our social and economic model
are supported and to vigorously combat waste
This is the only way in which the EU 2020 strategy will succeed in not being a bad copy of a bad original
(PT) Mr President , we are facing accelerating global change that has devastating consequences for our economic , political and social systems and , therefore , for all our citizens
We are currently witnessing an unprecedented weakening of the capacity of states to respond
The European Union must , therefore , identify common causes and allies , and act in a clear and united way on the world stage
Extraordinary situations require clear joint action
If we do not take the necessary strong measures and collective responsibility , Europe will be consigned to marginalisation and impoverishment
Only a strong Europe that respects collective rules will be able to give an adequate response to the new era
Weakened and indebted states do not have the capacity to protect their citizens
choices
We must do this or risk compromising our future
The future is won by committing to social cohesion , ensuring peace , constructing a new model based on the values of liberty , social justice and responsibility
So , the 2020 strategy and the integrated Europe 2020 guidelines constitute essential elements of a new cycle of growth and employment in Europe
In order to correctly implement this and carry it out , clear quantifiable objectives must be set out for employment , education and poverty reduction
It is also essential that everything be done to facilitate the Member States' transposition of their national objectives if the strategy is to be successful and correctly implemented
(DE) Mr President , the current Cohesion policy started life with the title of the Lisbon Strategy
challenges in our regions
economic development is considered to be equally as important as social development and providing training for workers
In principle , we need to take joint responsibility for the funds that are available to us
It is a bit like hardware and software - one cannot work without the other
(RO) I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Cort√©s Lastra for his efforts in drafting his report
This report emphasises yet again the important contribution made by the Cohesion policy in achieving the EU 2020 strategy objectives
We must therefore ensure that the Cohesion policy's regional focus is recognised as part of this strategy
We are all aware that the strategy's effective implementation will depend hugely on the way it is devised
later on
At the same time , better governance at a number of levels guarantees the effective implementation of the Cohesion policy at national , regional and local level
As beneficiaries of these policies , I believe that Member States must maintain the key role which they have in the decision-making process regarding the Cohesion policy within the Council
Finally , I wish to welcome the acknowledgement given to the role of the Structural Funds in achieving the strategy's objectives
Member States
I believe that such a measure would run completely contrary to the Cohesion policy's real objectives
(FR) Mr President , the key word in this 2020 strategy is growth
to an end tomorrow
model as the Lisbon Strategy , which failed
Europe is faced with a crisis which requires a much more visionary and political project , one with new ideas , which are completely lacking in this 2020 strategy
I should like to highlight one such idea
other continent , for the economic development of our Europe , through the use of intangible assets , such as the economy of culture , and of tangible assets , such as our regional specialities
What is more , a strategic vision is being developed that is almost entirely focused on the Member States
Yet these States , with their borders , traditional ways of thinking and centralised administrations , continue to preserve Europe in aspic
A greater regional dimension is required in the EU's future strategy
Danube , the Alps , the Atlantic Arc , and so on - must also be encouraged
in the bud when the funds for its implementation need to be released
The 2020 strategy being presented to us is therefore , in our view , characterised by a highly conventional and technocratic approach; it lacks political vision
(PL) The EU 2020 strategy is a document intended to establish the direction of the Union's development over the next decade
However , if this document is not to share the fate of the Lisbon Strategy , it has to be more realistic and closer to the ambitions of Member States
and supporting agriculture
burdens , mean the countries of Central and Eastern Europe will always be the poor relatives of the European Union
it is this which makes it possible for the poorer regions to bridge the gap in development
(IT) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in my opinion , an industrial policy that focuses exclusively on companies operating internationally and using advanced technologies is not the best route to success
We must not forget the whole small and medium enterprise sector , including both small-scale manufacturers and retailers
Innovation policy should be aimed at them also
measures to combat the extremely serious problem of counterfeiting , including through effective trade defence instruments
the national and macro-regional levels
the need for attention to be paid to the manufacturing situation in Padania
lies
(DA) Mr President , well , our aim was to become 'the most competitive and knowledge-based economy in the world' , but that did not happen
The challenges facing Europe over the next few years are enormous
we have spent more money than is supported by our productivity
and live up to their own responsibilities - that is the reason for all this
Europe's major problem , as I said , is a lack of competitiveness , and this is the problem that the 2020 strategy is intended to tackle
We must increase our competitiveness in relation to other countries and the Member States must put their economies in order while , at the same time , investing in the future
Indeed , it may be necessary to make cuts in what we call welfare services in order to use the money for education and research
Small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of Europe's economy
We therefore need to take them seriously in this strategy
They lack capital and they are finding it difficult to borrow money
We need to do something about this
are given priority
Finally , I would like to say that administrative burdens are also something that we have to struggle with all the time
The administrative rules that we lay down are , of course , a greater burden for small enterprises , which have very few employees
Finally , we must help small and medium-sized enterprises to enter the export markets
(IT) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I believe we are all running a serious risk of focusing purely on the crisis
in this House have focused heavily on the subjects of renewal and stability , neglecting everything else
These are subjects for the Member States
and almost forgotten
However , I firmly believe that a sense of perspective is needed in our formulation of policy
It is not by accident that the pact was called the 'Stability and Growth Pact'
An even more accurate title would have been the 'Stability for Growth Pact'
We need to start talking about growth and development again
This is the best way to stop speculation and to give genuine investors confidence instead
cohesion is a very important factor for competitiveness - it will be hard to create this positive climate , particularly at the moment
(SV) Mr President , recent times have shown us the importance of healthy government finances
and Growth Pact to be followed
The truth is , on the contrary , that it is essential for the EU now to focus on getting its run-away debt under control
Otherwise , the future could be even more terrifying
I was a member of the Swedish parliament , the Riksdag , during the 1990s and I was on the Finances Committee when our public finances collapsed
I am not particularly proud of this , but it is true: for a period , we had interest rates of 500%
crashed and George Soros won
Hard times lay ahead for the Swedish people , but , Mr Hoang Ngoc , we learnt one thing , and that was to keep our finances in order
The same applies to Europe - good order provides stability and growth
(EL) Europe still faces a multi-dimensional crisis today , which is hitting employment and low incomes particularly hard
When the European Union started , poverty only existed where there was no work
Today , 9
6% of Europeans are unemployed and 8% of workers are living on incomes below the poverty line
What are the prospects for 2020
This combination of unemployment and poverty is exacerbated by the pressure created by the ease with which redundancies can be made
At European level , there is no protection against redundancy and national legislation is being watered down , as in Greece
All this is happening in the Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion
We therefore need a minimum framework of disincentives for redundancy
Proposals have been made
The starting point is to recognise mass redundancies by companies which report a profit in the same country as an abusive practice
The logical consequence is for them to be excluded from European subsidies and to be subject to higher taxes and fines and to have to refund financing
of the workers
Mr President , I welcome many of the aims of the EU 2020 strategy: the focus on growth led by innovative businesses , on sustainable growth and on achieving high employment
However , to achieve this , the EU must not just talk the talk: we need to walk the walk
For example , when undertaking the essential reforms of financial services , we must remember that innovative businesses and those employers need access to capital in global markets
seen to be sustainable
Mr President , I believe that today's debate has shown and proved that Parliament can and should make a significant contribution to the development of the strategy
Because of my remit , I would like to thank Mr van Nistelrooij and Mr Cort√©s Lastra , in particular , for their reports
it should be
Both reports ultimately stress the positive impact of this measure
I would like to thank Mr Cort√©s Lastra , in particular , for this significant contribution and for pointing out what the Lisbon Strategy ultimately did deliver , despite all the criticism
innovation and research
Mrs Schroeder might consider this a bitter pill , but obviously you need to set a target
one general umbrella
Of course , we need points of emphasis and we need to set priorities , and that is the idea behind earmarking
However , we can achieve a great deal by using a bottom-up and a top-down approach at the same time
in training and , finally , on transport and infrastructure , in the broadest sense of those terms , as well
make and keep European society more globally competitive
It has been demonstrated that out of the more than 450 operational programmes , only 246 are focusing on research and innovation
This quite clearly shows that points of emphasis , such as research and development , are necessary and that that must remain the case
2000-2006 period
However , we need to ensure better coordination of course , especially in the areas of research and innovation
There is no conflict between excellence , on the one hand , and a broad geographic spread , on the other
It must be our objective to promote brain circulation , not brain drain from some or many regions into a few
On the contrary , we need to ensure circulation of knowledge and of the people involved , particularly when it comes to research , innovation and development
to a stronger result-targeted approach and perspective
local objectives and thereby make the strategies tangible , visible and comprehensible
One final comment: my understanding of regional policy is that it is investment policy , and by that I mean investment in all regions
State are destined for the European Union , to the 26 other countries
That means that if these countries are doing well , the 27th Member State will do well too
That must be one of our objectives
If today we also talk about how to tackle the crisis , then restructuring the budget cannot be our only concern , because growth constitutes a very important factor as well
That alone will provide our successful exit from the crisis in the long term and regional policy can make a significant contribution to that
Member of the Commission
- Mr President , there are five plus two questions put forward concerning economic governance and Europe 2020
I will do my best to answer in five minutes , and in order to do that , I will use English as opposed to my native language
role of the national parliaments and the European Parliament in the multilateral surveillance process
important role , not only in its capacity as a colegislator , but also as a driving force for mobilising citizens and the national parliaments
partners and representatives of civil society
The second question concerns the Stability and Growth Pact and the additional instruments the Commission may foresee to complement this pact
Here , I would like to refer to our communication on reinforcing economic policy coordination , which we adopted last week
In this communication the Commission set out proposals on reinforcing compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact and deeper fiscal policy coordination
Specifically , the Commission intends to make budgetary surveillance and policy coordination more forward-looking
plans ahead of their adoption
individual procedures , in particular , with regard to Member States in repeated breach of the pact
The Commission also proposes to reinforce the macro-economic prevention framework for euro area Member States by establishing a permanent crisis resolution framework
Under the proposed mechanism , the EU would be able to issue debt to finance emergency loans to a euro area member in distress
hand , the 2008 EMU 10 report
The policy recommendations that we made in 2006 focused on the changes brought about by the reform of the Pact in 2005
good times and on the positive role of national fiscal frameworks
At the same time , the lessons of more than 10 years of EMU and the recent impact of the crisis call for an updated but still consistent assessment
Last week's communication on reinforcing economic policy coordination focuses on making the pact more rigorous with regard to both its preventive and corrective arm
It also makes detailed proposals against the background of the new opportunities provided by the Lisbon Treaty
a 'European semester' to strengthen ex ante integrated economic policy coordination; and , finally , working towards a robust and permanent crisis resolution mechanism for euro area Member States in fiscal distress
The fourth question refers to the task force established by the European Council in March 2010 in order to improve economic governance in the Union
The Commission will cooperate constructively in the interest of the Union and in full respect of its right of initiative
Last week's communication already constitutes a significant contribution to the task force
The European Parliament , in this context , is obviously a very important stakeholder in the EU economic governance reform
Through its work and reports in the relevant committees - economic crisis committees in particular - Parliament is already providing valuable contributions to the deliberations of the task force
The fifth and final question is about the trust that needs to be rebuilt in European banks and financial markets and in the European project in general
I will just sum this up very quickly , because it is a broad subject
stability rules very clear , transparent and understandable for all; and , third , to restore the growth potential of Europe
That is why Europe 2020 plays an important role in this context as well
So these elements , in my view , are equally important in restoring trust in the European project
This leads me to the two questions on the Europe 2020 strategy
Member States on setting national targets to underpin the headline targets
meets the 75% target in terms of employment levels
targets for the strategy
feature of each Member State
Spring Council
and June
or EU-level action could bring the EU closer to the targets
The European Council has said that it will review the headline target in June on the basis of further work
There is particular interest in an explanation on the poverty target , if you will allow me
The Spring Council asked the Commission to help the Member States to identify suitable indicators underpinning the EU headline target for social inclusion , in particular , through poverty reduction
After hearing the concerns of the various Member States , the Commission has presented a possible compromise proposal
The proposal is based on three main EU poverty indicators , namely: at risk of poverty; material deprivation; and the number of jobless households
Together , they reflect the multifaceted nature of poverty and the range of situations in the Member States
set
The Commission is actively exploring the possible solutions
On governance , I wish to reassure you that we set great store by your role in the new strategy and by your input
President Barroso has made it clear that involving Parliament more closely in Europe 2020 is one of his main concerns for his second term
We are doing our best to make sure that Parliament has enough time to come to an opinion this year
I am personally fully committed to helping you in the process in every possible way
We need to have all the main EU institutions on board if the political ownership needed is to be there and the strategy is to succeed
Concerning education and training , which is the subject of the second question on Europe 2020 , I would just like to say the following
As early as the crisis recovery plan of November 2008 , the Commission called on Member States to retain investment in education and training , and we will maintain this focus
In general , Member States have responded positively to the call to target the recovery measures at smart investment in resources of future growth
Many governments have neither reduced student support nor scaled back enrolment
On the contrary , many recovery packages have included measures to support wider participation in education , particularly in higher education
In spite of the crisis , education budgets announced for 2010 have remained constant or increased in many Member States
However , we do see signs of planned decreases in the education budgets of other countries
We should bear in mind that some governments had already planned - and in some cases executed - general cuts in public budgets before the onset of the crisis
Many such cuts would affect education
Other Member States are exploring ways to diversify the sources of funding
The Commission will continue to watch this issue carefully
In some countries , financial constraints will only appear now
We will monitor general state budgets as well as the efficiency of investment
At European level and within the existing multiannual financial framework , the Commission intends to prioritise action supporting the Europe 2020 objectives
Boosting economic recovery , investing in Europe's youth and building tomorrow's infrastructure are the priorities of the 2011 draft budget that the Commission recently adopted
actions
Let us not forget that we also intervene in this area through the Structural Funds
The European Social Fund , with a budget of EUR 76 billion over the 2007-2013 period , helps young people move from education to the world of work
It also helps people to return to education to renew and expand their skills
Around one third of the beneficiaries of the European Social Fund are young people
The Fund also allocates EUR 8
3 billion , which represents roughly 11% of its overall budget , to the reform of Member States' education and training systems
All of this demonstrates that the Europe 2020 strategy reinforces the concept of the knowledge-based economy and that education and training are at the heart of this
We will make sure that we have the resources to reach our targets
(MT) It is worrying that the economic crisis is going to give rise to long-term repercussions
As the population age increases , so will the Member States' challenge in guaranteeing sustainability in the area of social welfare
part of national fiscal policy
The drop in birth rates and an ever-increasing ageing population call for a change in policy if we are to guarantee fiscal sustainability
In addition , the rise in pension demands and medical assistance must be kept in mind
With regard to demographic change patterns , the European Union needs a motivational strategy for senior citizens in order to keep them in employment for a longer period of time
It is essential that we consider such strategies in light of the specific requirements among the various Member States
We cannot employ a one-size-fits-all policy
Each case merits individual attention
Consequently , it is fundamental that there are more employed persons on the labour market , and that we increase opportunities for high level employment
This will not only reduce the dependency on social services but will also ensure a higher number of contributors to these schemes
them succeed
are reached , which will increase employment within the European Union
and to how we can maintain and strengthen our competitiveness so that we can create growth and more jobs
compete on the basis of knowledge and skills , quality green jobs and decent conditions in the labour market
In this regard , it is a little worrying to see the Commission's unbalanced focus on flexibility in the flexicurity model
That will not achieve anything
People need to be safe and secure in order to be flexible
There needs to be some form of support that people can live on if they lose their jobs
Further training needs to be provided so that people can move around the labour market to the best job opportunities
Investments are needed in the Member States , but they must be investments that pay off in the long term
The Commission must do more to address social dumping
Anyone moving from one country to another for a job should work under the conditions applicable in their new country
market must not take precedence over the rules governing workers' rights
Mr President , I would just like to say that the debate this afternoon reflects Parliament's willingness , indeed insistence , on being fully engaged in this process
Given my limited time , I would just like to make three brief points
I support Commissioner Rehn's statement - and indeed Commissioner Andor's statement today - in regard to the scrutiny of Member State's budgets
At one point , it looked like the eurozone and the EU might not make it to 2020 as an entity
So to ensure that not only do we survive but thrive , it is crucial that Member States deliver on commitments and promises already made
Closing the stable door after the horse has bolted has always been a useless exercise
Secondly , for the past 18 months , Member States and the EU have focused almost exclusively on the stabilisation of financial institutions
In fact , we have been consumed by it
While this is important , very many citizens have lost trust and are now feeling abandoned
citizens , especially those below the poverty line
Finally , there is a major crisis in youth unemployment
A Commission document issued yesterday confirmed that youth unemployment in the EU stands at 20% , which is twice that forecast for overall unemployment
must be real coordination between , and strong influence on , Member States to translate those initiatives into concrete jobs
and thinking only about building a successful future
regions of Europe
has to increase its production of food by 70% , because there are more and more people in the world , and less and less land is being used for agricultural production
It is difficult to understand why the development of agriculture is not being treated as a priority in the strategy
Agriculture means food security , agriculture means ecological security , and these things are so important for us and for future generations
I cannot imagine a responsible development strategy for the European Union which does not include concern for the development of European agriculture
Greek centre-right party on the support mechanism for the Greek economy
We need to clarify certain points
Our party has never opposed the European support mechanism for Greece
Our party simply had a perception of the measures that should have been applied
with the other political parties in Greece and Greek society
The majority in government refused any prior agreement which might have resulted in broad and necessary political and social assent
I repeat , the New Democracy party did not oppose the European support mechanism of the European Union and the International Monetary Fund
We respect our partners' every last euro and we thank them for their support
That is why we responsibly supported a different , more effective policy mix
disastrous consequences for Greek society and the economy and , ultimately , a negative impact on Europe
As regards our debate on the economic crisis and the 2020 strategy , I believe that the time has come for specific acts and tangible results
Enough talk
That is the point of my speech
Keep it simple
The euro is an historic success of European integration and we should defend and rescue it
Lisbon Strategy
(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))
(FR) Mr Koumoutsakos , you do have some cheek
I have just heard you talk about the Greek Government and how it did not bother to consult you , the various parties or civil society before implementing the measures
Although , I must say that the current Greek Government is not in any way responsible for the situation
It is a victim of speculators , who I will be criticising in a few moments , when I speak
power for at least two parliamentary terms
I therefore think that responsibility rests more with Greece and that political responsibility rests with your party
Do you have a reply to this question , Mr Koumoutsakos
(EL) Sir , your speech is the result of poor information
years , were highlighted and dramatised by the huge international economic crisis
well , became a borrowing crisis
That is how we arrived at today's drastic situation
sin cast the first stone' applies
(MT) Mr President , never more than today has the importance of long-term sustainability of public finances been pushed to the forefront in such a dramatic manner
It is easy and natural to say 'we warned you not to let your deficits and debts spiral out of control' and we have every reason to
try to do so in as short a time as possible while ignoring the serious economic environment we find ourselves in
This is not an appeal to postpone our actions in the field of public finances
I am not implying anything of the sort
not worse
less
We must help the weaker European Union countries to stimulate their economies through exports and therefore help to stimulate job growth prospects
Let us not be dogmatic
This situation requires that we act intelligently
It also necessitates an element of flexibility in many sectors , not least in economic policy
that is why I was delighted that you mentioned poverty reduction in your speech
to protect them
from the labour market can gain access to good-quality work , and that , at the same time , we have targets to eradicate undeclared work
We must also make sure that Member States invest in social security and social protection systems as well as guaranteeing access to rights , resources and universal services
I would also like to see an EU-wide target to end street homelessness by 2015 by Member States , and to develop integrated homelessness strategies
In all these areas , not only should Parliament be consulted more - and I was pleased that you did mention that - but NGOs working in the field as well
As far as the open method of coordination is concerned in the social field , it needs to be strengthened
put into place - but only if those mechanisms are put into place
the European Union fell last year by 4%
However , it is not the timing which is worst here
to treat as European measures , specifically employment , research and development , education and combating poverty
Basically , there is nothing supranational about these issues
They are matters for which individual countries are responsible
It can be said that only climate policy is an area in which we can take a certain amount of action at European level
The others , quite frankly , are matters for individual Member States
(FR) Mr President , the 2020 strategy ought to incorporate opinions on the economic crisis and propose a new form of governance rather than try to mend the current failing system
First of all , let us get rid of some false ideas , particularly those concerning Greece
This is not a Greek crisis
thousands of billions of dollars in a few days in order to save the banks , but which leaves Greece in agony for several months
International summits are now ignored; what will be , will be
Finally , finance was going to be regulated and Europe had its endless discussions , but the vultures have not gone away
So now what is everybody saying
That the market must be reassured
Who is the market , though
Speculators , whom we must appease as if they were demigods and to whom we must make offerings so that we can beg them for mercy
How much longer do people have to endure this cynical approach
How much longer do we have to live under the illusion of a market which gives financiers more than they deserve but which impoverishes the people
We cannot allow the terrorism of financial markets to bring whole countries to their knees
A counterfeiter runs a huge risk because he is attacking an element of a State's sovereignty: its currency
However , when a trader speculates on a country's debt , he does not risk a thing
When will the white-collar criminals of high finance be properly punished
be required to properly supervise financial markets , rather than attack public services
Ladies and gentlemen , to finish , I think that they have been playing this joke on us long enough
up announcing that the EU is bankrupt
(BG) Mr President , the European Cohesion policy has demonstrated its vital role over the years and has become a key policy for the Community
It provides European citizens with a visible , quantifiable indicator of solidarity
Its role is also recognised through its inclusion among the objectives of the Treaty of Lisbon
All of this earns its rightful place in the Europe 2020 strategy
In the draft strategy , this policy was not given its necessary place
provides invaluable guidelines
so that we can confirm the European Union as being a strong global player
Reliable benchmarks are needed for indicating the effectiveness and efficiency of the resources invested in this policy
As it states in the report , an assessment is required of the impact of the Cohesion policy's expenditure on regional development , based on specific indicators
Treaty of Lisbon
Objective , precise evaluation criteria can only be established after considering the definition of the actual concept
This will provide a concrete basis for the policy , as well as for institutions and citizens
significant , valuable reflections
part of the solution
In my view , the EU 2020 strategy is , at the moment , still much more a part of the problem than of the solution
I believe that it is our shared responsibility to make this strategy much more a part of the solution
Allow me to stop for a moment and ask you kindly to consider that the strategy's very name is problematic
In the vast majority of the European Union's languages , the name EU 2020 strategy has no meaning whatsoever
problems in their personal lives whose name is so intangible and distant from the realities of their personal lives
This name may be very meaningful when discussed by marketing specialists
However , we are not talking about marketing specialists here , but about ordinary Europeans
There is another wise Hungarian saying: he who grabs a lot takes little
In my judgment , the strategy - which is still part of the problem - grabs a lot and takes little
The best thing would perhaps be for it to deal with the most important question
In this regard , let me point out that , in my view , what we need to do is to strengthen regional development
Strengthening regional development involves investment , growth and job creation , and I think that the most serious problem facing people today is that they need jobs and more jobs
These are the points I wish to offer for your consideration
the negative structural effects that the financial , economic and social crisis has produced and is continuing to produce
aimed at restoring social dialogue and cohesion
Infrastructures are the cornerstone of the relaunch of innovation policy in industry , SMEs , manufacturing consortiums or research institutes and in the relationship between these and universities and local institutions
States , it starts to deal with the question of criteria for harmonisation of financial instruments and operational plans aimed at innovation
and citizens have been asking us for for a long time
I believe that on this point , Europe can and must do much to promote growth , development and employment
Mr President , as we seek to solve the financial and economic crisis , I would like to point out an essential deficit: that of knowledge
I regret to say that Europe is becoming a more stupid continent every day , even though knowledge is our most fruitful and rich resource
Investing in it bears no risk
The young generation of Europeans pays the price of the crisis , however , as youth unemployment grows and education and innovation budgets are frozen or cut
We have to cut budgets , but let us do so with a 21st century attitude , because where is half of the EU budget going now
To agriculture
It should go to the young generation , and their development
Not just a traditional education but one that focuses on e-skills and entrepreneurship for example
We know that the higher one's education is , the lower the chances of losing a job
Yet Member States are not meeting the necessary commitment in fostering an ambitious knowledge economy
United States to become more attractive places for talent , research , creativity and innovation
Short-term measures will have a high long-term cost
not know what stupidity costs
Today , Commissioner Kroes presented her vision for Europe's digital agenda , one of the EU 2020 flagship programmes
It is an ambitious yet concrete strategy which seeks to make Europe's digital market stronger in a global economy as well as connecting many Europeans to an open Internet
interest that they can never pay back
States fulfil their commitments
(DE) Mr President , the Lisbon Strategy did not have any sustainable success
Why not
Member States , social partners and large parts of civil society were too little involved and so they had no sense of shared responsibility
The EU 2020 strategy can be different
It could be a success , Commissioner , if it also deals with those who are excluded , who are losing out and who often do not have a lobby
In the EU , not even two thirds of those who are capable of work are in work
Only just under a half of all older workers have a job
Eighty million Europeans are insufficiently qualified and have increasingly fewer opportunities in the labour market
This is a situation we cannot accept
However , a genuine future strategy needs a social orientation
Qualitative growth in the economy and employment on the one hand must be reconciled with social equality and with sustainability
Commissioner Andor , we are both working on that
What does this mean in concrete terms
The social security systems of Member States must be adapted to democratic change
Through exchange of best practice throughout Europe , we could make our contribution to that and we could learn from and with each other
The European Social Fund - one of your hobby horses - must be adapted to the new challenges , so that we can be even more efficient on the ground
The European Globalisation Fund is so constructed that those at risk of unemployment are able to find their feet
Our society must be integrative and integrate young people , for example , through appropriate education and training , so that they can develop professionally and personally
to save money on: investment in our citizens - in economic , sustainable and social terms
The EU 2020 strategy will rise and fall with these three pillars
(DE) Mr President , Mr Mann , I hope you are in regular contact with your Chancellor , if you see things in the same way that I do
and when it has distanced itself from the people
We absolutely need to offer something positive to our citizens that will offset that situation
When it comes to growth and employment , we should stop putting people's interests behind those of business
Indeed , that must be the key objective of the EU 2020 strategy because Europe needs social progress
full employment at all costs because we need good jobs
subsidies and that they can actually make a living from these jobs
an end with the EU 2020 strategy
We need a more active labour market policy and one which covers many areas
Finally , people expect more specific answers , very specific answers , in fact , and not an umpteenth strategy
mechanism to give protection against economic collapse
the European Union , restrict ourselves for many years just to economic debate
The European Union must not behave as if it were only an efficient businessman who is building the economic success of his firm
The Europe 2020 strategy should contain significant reference to the role of culture in achieving the social and economic objectives which have been set
protection of cultural heritage as part of the European Regional Development Fund
and the creative industries which have brought Europe renown
It is this sector in which we can build competitiveness in relation to other parts of the world
Creativity requires stimulation and development from the earliest years of life
Only then will we be able to count on its turning to a significant degree into innovation , including in fields of modern technology , in the European Union
Culture must not be neglected in European policy
We must not dismiss all proposals to increase its role in European Union policy simply by saying that it is a competence of the Member States
which bear the main burden of this spectacular programme
I expect , therefore , greater determination from the European Commission to ensure that the final version of the 2020 strategy includes culture
as you have said , unless we strengthen the mechanisms and instruments that the European Union has at its disposal to sustain investment in the knowledge triangle: education , training and research
Just now , Commissioner , you confirmed that as regards this objective , some European governments are performing well , others a little less so
with Member States , provide incentives and penalties in the European Social Fund and monitor the results
reinvesting the savings in these areas , especially as we have a 19% early school leaving rate and 25% youth unemployment
In conclusion , do you not consider it opportune to strengthen the legal powers in Directive 2005/36/EC to facilitate the mutual recognition of professional qualifications among Member States
difficult issue of mutual recognition of qualifications
(IT) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I too have an observation to make on what happened in the last decade , 2000-2010 , as far as Lisbon is concerned
It is true that many of us , given also what happened until 2008-2009 , viewed the results obtained with less than complete satisfaction
in the area of employment
agree with them , although when reading them thoroughly , I still see too many shortcomings
I would dwell at length on what are the guiding principles of this proposal , but I shall limit myself to considering growth and employment
of low structural growth , and of high rates of unemployment
Hence , the targets that we set ourselves are too ambitious and , at times , too inflexible
So , perhaps with a little less ambition and a little more flexibility , the growth and employment targets will be achievable
in all policy fields , I am disappointed that this has not been put into practice for the EU 2020 strategy
Should we not be more ambitious than we were for the Lisbon Strategy
Ignoring 52% of the available skills , knowledge and workforce of Europe for any sector or any level would be a serious loss
to be shown through specific gender statistics
We also need specific targets so that we can measure the commitment of each Member State to gender equality , and make improvements thereto
How
We need to decrease the gender pay gap by 10% in each Member State
sector for our ageing society
We need to increase the numbers of women in decision-making bodies such as managerial and executive board positions based on a Norwegian 40% quota model
We need to increase the possibilities available for women in research and development and innovation , and train them in new green jobs
Member States cannot neglect to expand , improve and implement the Barcelona targets in all Member States
We need the true commitment of the European Union and all Member States by involving all people when working towards a smart , green progressive society
I am convinced that our Commissioner , Mr Andor , is going to do it
(PL) Discussion about the Europe 2020 strategy must take account of the experience of the previous strategy
the successes came , among other things , from 'Lisbonisation' or the inclusion of certain of the Lisbon objectives in Cohesion policy
In relation to this , we have to ask how to approach the new strategy
over a longer time scale , such as Cohesion policy
integrated with each other
All measures which separate individual policies , split up funds and divide roles will end in the same failure as the last strategy
Therefore , we need to combine , integrate and produce actions associated with synergy
(FI) Mr President , the indebtedness of national economies and an ageing population together constitute a real time bomb for Europe
We know that , for example , the incidence of agerelated illnesses , such as Alzheimer's disease , will double over the next ten years
That will mean a huge burden on national economies
We should not , however , make a mystery out of debt
As I recall , Ceauc≈üescu's Romania was a country without debt , as is North Korea
There is also 'smart productive debt' - intelligent debt if that debt is invested in people
In this respect , the elimination of poverty , for example , is a very lucrative investment for society , as is reducing youth unemployment
What I am quite rightly afraid of at present , while the Member States start to reduce their deficits , is where the cuts are to be made
Will they be in education , the employment of older people , the employment of the disabled , or what
That will not be smart or intelligent
That is why this EU 2020 strategy is a very important document , and I am one of those who say more Europe and not less Europe
More Europe means something like root canal treatment: Member States will be obliged to accomplish the targets that are set out in this EU 2020 strategy
(DE) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Europe 2020 strategy - to be honest , I do not feel like discussing the Europe 2020 strategy at all
Ten years ago , we adopted a strategy , the Lisbon Strategy
When you now look back at this past decade , the results are limited , if I may put it in those modest terms
I think that we should currently be focusing on what really matters to people at home in our Member States , rather than making the same mistake again
They are wondering whether we will be able to ensure the stability of our currency
Will there be inflation
What lessons do we need to learn from the developments over the last two years , from the financial and economic crisis , and now from the currency crisis
Are we really taking to task the players in the financial markets who have contributed to the crisis
the case in recent years , money being sent around the globe five times in the same day and many people making a profit on this while losses are being nationalised
I would ask the Commission to demand that Member States exercise strict budgetary discipline and implement appropriate rules
I would also ask for the earliest possible tightening of the Stability and Growth Pact
This is where we should be focusing our efforts
I urge the Commission to take requisite measures , but not as before , off its own bat or by discussing them thoroughly with Member States
Instead , it should finally take Parliament seriously as an equal legislator alongside the 27 Members States
(EL) I agree with the previous speaker; the Stability Pact needs to be applied
However , a number of other things need to be applied before the Stability Pact
had taken the measures it needed to take , we would have saved a lot of money for the citizens of Europe
In order for the European Union to be strong economically and to count globally , it needs its citizens
The citizens must be healthy and educated and must have work
The European Union needs to bear this in mind when planning for 2020 , when planning for the single market
The single market must be centred on the citizen and must be a single market with a human face
(LV) Thank you , Mr President
I have a dog at home
Recently , my dog took a sausage from the table and ate it
The question is - who is to blame for the fact that the dog ate the sausage
Is the dog to blame , for doing what is natural to it
Or rather , am I to blame for not clearing away the sausage and putting it back in the refrigerator after I had finished my meal
On the global financial markets , the value of the euro keeps falling every day
Who is to blame for this
Many fellow Members say that the speculators are to blame , that the market is to blame , for attacking the euro and depreciating its value
Ladies and gentlemen , I offer you the suggestion that , perhaps , the market is not to blame
Rather , it is the market that has pinpointed the underlying fault , the underlying cause
to earn
The markets react to this in the same way that my dog reacted to the smell of the sausage that I had left on the table
our currency and had lost all confidence in it
Instead of complaining about this situation , we corrected our fundamental indicators , we repaired and collected our public finances
control their public spending , for their income to match their outgoings
This would restore confidence , ease the crisis and restore calm to the financial markets
Thank you
Mr President , today we are discussing , among others , two excellent reports by Ricardo Cort√©s Lastra and Lambert van Nistelrooij
growth that the knowledge economy plays
The EU 2020 strategy is , on several counts , similar to the Lisbon Strategy , but tries to improve on focusing on and narrowing down the objectives
There is , however , one area - a quite significant one - that still remains unclear , namely the delivery mechanism
It is left to the Member States and peer review supported by monitoring by the Commission
It seems to me that we have not learned our lesson from the experience of the weak delivery of the Lisbon Strategy
be met with action and not just words
(EL) The Lisbon Strategy set high targets , but Europe did not manage to implement them
We are moving towards a new strategy for the next decade , to be true , and in an exceptionally difficult and unfortunate environment
and it allows us to be optimistic about the future of Europe
It is important to emphasise that this strategy must be implemented in an environment of solidarity , in an environment of close cooperation between the Member States
no doubt as to the fact that we recognise it
In the New Democracy , in our centre-right party in Greece , we made it clear that we respect the money of the other European peoples being put into the support mechanism
date
out of the crisis stronger
(The speaker agreed to reply IN DUE COURSE to a blue card question under Rule 149(8))
Mr President , I have seen for myself how important Cohesion policy is for Wales and I , therefore , welcome the Lastra report on Cohesion policy and Europe 2020
There are many projects right across Wales that are benefiting individuals and communities
So , I have no doubt that structural funds can help deliver the 2020 goals
However , I would like to make the following points
The 2020 strategy , the fifth cohesion report and the budget must all be aligned
of convergent status
If we can achieve all these things , I certainly believe that the Cohesion policy can help us deliver 2020
It would also make the EU 2020 strategy relevant to individuals and citizens right across Europe
to make the following clarification , which I consider extremely important in these times of crisis , especially for Greece:
Greece is not taking money from other nations
rate of interest
We are not taking money from other nations
(EL) You are absolutely right Mrs Rapti
months now , on the part of the present Greek Government
(DE) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs Niebler has already said a great deal that very much concerns me too
I am greatly concerned about our future together in the EU
I cannot just move on to the agenda without mentioning the crisis
One of our major objectives , the euro and its high monetary stability , is at risk of total collapse
Prosperity and jobs are not feasible without a secure monetary value
We are talking about Europe 2020 , but we do not even know what Europe will look like in 2011
We are debating meat glued together with thrombin and we are debating driving times for self-employed drivers , as if the major problems of the Union will solve themselves
We need to send out strong and rapid signals about regulating , organising and improving the deficits in both state budgets and in the banking sector
Let me give you a couple of examples: we need clear definitions and harsh penalties for deficit offenders , such as withdrawing funding
We need clear rules for banks , such as banning credit default swaps or requirements for insurance and depositing these against corresponding nominal values
spend money he does not have is a long way from being a saver
(DE) Mr President , I would like to come back to the report by Mr Cort√©s Lastra , which I think is a very good report
Indeed , the Cohesion policy is actually the best instrument for mobilising investment in growth and employment
strategy
Four out of five Europeans live in urban areas
Towns and cities are the driving force of economic growth in Europe
At the same time , they are experiencing many problems particularly acutely
Key words here are social integration , the environment and transport , for example , but also demographic change
Therefore , towns and cities have a particular role when it comes to actually improving the living conditions of citizens
and the EU 2020 strategy
All of this should be taken into account during the implementation of these strategies and during the shaping of the future course of the Cohesion policy
for many years still , and have put renewed pressure on and new tears in our social cohesion
realistic in its objectives and balanced in the goals it sets itself
Three of these seem to me , Commissioner , to be priorities
The first is certainly a stable currency and stable national budgets , which , however , must not be divorced from development and economic growth
We need investment in research and innovation to make our industries ever more competitive and our products of the highest quality
We must support SMEs and new industries , such as IT and sustainable energy and , of course , our infrastructure
Let us raise the overall level of education , yes , but chiefly we must mould training to the needs of the labour market and production
It is a paradox that businesses are still demanding specialisms that the market is in no position to offer
It is clear that every target should be related to the national context , but within the framework of a broader European strategy
cohesion , development and stable national budgets , we need strong and solid economic governance at the European level , to enable European institutions , including Parliament , to take effective and preventive action
now provide ourselves with the means to implement them
These means include , for example , the establishment of an EU economic government
is essential that we provide ourselves with the resources necessary to take action
and the European Parliament are involved in these inspection arrangements
However , I should like to speak in more detail about the crisis and young people
back at the heart of this Europe 2020 strategy
Firstly , the EU 2020 strategy must be an inclusive strategy
Mobility , which is the concrete expression of the concept of free movement within the EU , must become a real possibility for all young people , not only for young students
That is why I hope the Commission will support my proposal for an extension to the European mobility programmes for young apprentices
the transition from a learning environment to a first job is one of the major challenges faced by young people
The way to make progress in this area is to enhance their skills , for example , by channelling EU funds more effectively towards policies for young people
Finally , all young Europeans need to be given mobility opportunities and upskilled because what we need , above all else , is an innovative young generation
It is young people who , today , will create the growth and innovation of tomorrow
This is why I do not want young people to be left out of this Europe 2020 strategy
(ES) Mr President , we approved the Lisbon Agenda with its very ambitious objectives in 2000
Some of these have been met , but a lot of them have not
There is no doubt that the regional funds contributed to the Lisbon Strategy
Ten years on , we find ourselves shaken by the worst economic crisis we can remember
so as to achieve better results
Firstly , we have learned that coordination between all governance levels is essential , as is clearly stated in Mr Cort√©s Lastra's report
We have also learned that the contribution of regional funds is essential to meeting the objectives we are proposing
We believe that the combination of specific actions at all levels - European Union , national , regional and local authorities - is an absolute necessity
If we work together , we will be much stronger
It is also important that a Cohesion policy covering economic , social and territorial aspects be incorporated into the Europe 2020 strategy
I would also like to make an observation as regards the Cohesion policy issue here , namely that the bureaucratic procedures should be much more flexible and efficient
Furthermore , in the disability sector , that difference will have to be taken into account in some way
with special needs , such as mountain areas , coastal areas and islands
in line with the new situation
(RO) Europe 2020 must be a Europe for its citizens and meet their needs
This is the approach which I consider must form the basis of this strategy
results so as to achieve a positive impact
I am referring here specifically to investments in any kind of infrastructure , enabling us to become much more competitive from an economic perspective
also stipulated in the Treaty of Lisbon
regional players to respond to the global challenges
Europe 2020 is a Europe where regions develop according to their specific potential and use the regional aspect of research , development and innovation for promoting economic development and increasing employment
(DE) Mr President , when we talk about Europe 2020 , then we are , first and foremost , talking about the future of our continent: Where do we want to go
What sort of life will our citizens be able to live here
What we need to do first , in my view , is to analyse the actual situation so that we can find the right tools to achieve these objectives
It is also important to make a distinction between cause and effect
What really are the major issues we face today
I think one of them is certainly the ageing of our European societies
So far , we have unfortunately failed to make Europe attractive enough for people to even start families and have children
That means that we will face a major pressure on public budgets in future , because our pension systems are at risk of being underfunded
Secondly , we already have high government deficits
According to Keynes's classical teaching , we have spent a lot of money in this crisis
Now it is time to save
However , that also means of course that our currency will come under pressure
to generate economic growth so that we are able to address these high government deficits
Here in Europe , we have rules governing these areas , like the Stability and Growth Pact , but unfortunately , no one is sticking to them
This is one of the main problems
We are creating new rules , but I think that it would sometimes be much better to apply our existing rules so they can really achieve their full effect
I therefore urge the Commission , in particular , to create a climate of stringency , so that we can achieve these agreed objectives
(DE) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to pick up on what Mr Seeber has already said
If we really want to successfully carry off the objectives of the 2020 agenda , we first need to attend to the job in hand
We need strong financial market regulation , regulation that really will be better at supervising and regulating future conduct in these areas
is spent and in what ways we should support further development
and make it clear which tasks need to be fulfilled if we are to achieve the objectives we have quite rightly set for ourselves
in my view
being aware of what priority issues we need to resolve
That has to be our starting point
We first need to focus on bringing our financial situation under control and ensuring that everyone adheres to these rules
and we must have a greater say in what is happening in some Member States
(GA) Mr President , I am proud to say a few words in relation to this debate about the 2020 strategy and here are the points I would like to make
I must say it is disappointing and sometimes depressing to hear speaker after speaker here in Strasbourg and in Brussels talk about the failure of the Lisbon Strategy
last October
There have been many benefits for all to see , in particular at regional level , as the Commissioner pointed out
However , there are a number of areas which I would be concerned about
Firstly , where does the six-month rotating presidency fit into this
years
you cannot achieve in a short period of time
Secondly , I welcome the instruments which have been brought in to make Member States stand up to their responsibilities , and pay for their failures if they do not do so
'Softly , softly' will not do anymore
If you are part of a team , and you play badly , you are either dropped or told to up your game
We have to up our game
Finally , I want to say that I also welcome the suggestion to empower the regions and the cities as part of this process
markets
Although the European Parliament is subject to longer parliamentary procedures , it must not be condemned to inaction
I think that this House , and we , its Members , have three essential roles to play
First of all , we must throw all our weight behind governments and the Commission in the initiatives they have taken recently
growth model that is truly dynamic and supports the real economy
That is the entire challenge of the EU 2020 strategy and of the priority objectives which we will earmark for the EU Structural Funds for the period 2014-2020
the economic situation was different from what it is today
Therefore , those who condemn this strategy do so because it is inflexible and inappropriate for the current situation
This is the problem with strategies
Therefore , this 2020 strategy will be all the stronger if it can be adapted to prevailing circumstances
approval
European citizens woke up on Monday , 10 May to a new Europe
They had not caused this metamorphosis
No one can assess its long-term consequences at this stage
This metamorphosis will not bear fruit if it is not rooted in democracy
We were united in diversity; now we must be united in adversity
(Applause)
matter that I consider to be important
in deep crisis
As we discuss Europe 2020 , we need to bear a situation of this type in mind
this economy
we do not have to depend on anyone at all , but what is important is the locomotive , and for the locomotive to pull , we also need the means
especially one that can get the TEN-T , TEN-E and E-TEN networks going
This is the locomotive that we must bring into play , and to pull the real economy , we also need the private sector , through the PPP mechanism
now
structural reforms to attain growth for our economy
between budgetary consolidation policies and the need to avoid falling back into recession
I am a Portuguese national and at this very moment , the proposal that is being made is to increase taxes
can achieve the necessary growth
As well as the long and medium terms , we must think about the short term and start encouraging the existence of creative companies right now
We must make a commitment to universities and to research and development , because that is very clear now
In order for use to reach 2020 , we will have to make it through 2010 in one piece
I would like to leave this worry behind now
It is clear that we have a Stability Pact , but there is also a Growth Pact , and the key word for our economies in the near future is growth
economic space , and one that is economically , socially and territorially cohesive
government , particularly those of a regional and local nature
Regions and local authorities must be included in the design and implementation of policies if we want the 2020 strategy to bear any fruit in the medium term
Our regions and cities are key agents in the development and implementation of a great deal of EU public investment related to growth and employment
The allocation of regional policy resources thus becomes a key factor in terms of meeting the European objectives that we are defining
000 jobs in the European Union , as well as the building of over 2 000 km of motorways
I would like to finish by pointing out once more the value of the European regional policy with respect to strategic goals such as growth and employment
Economic , social and territorial cohesion represents a basic objective guaranteed by the treaties
issues for the European Union over the next ten years more attentively and in greater numbers than many of our Members
We are conducting this debate in much too technocratic a way
I grew up in a country where society was organised according to multiannual plans
This country , the German Democratic Republic , no longer exists
and which pass on the implementation to others
local authorities that will have to shoulder the implementation
The disquiet with such procedures is very much in evidence
A top-down Europe cannot work
The united Europe can only work if we continue to build it jointly with national and regional institutions and with citizens
The Commission has abandoned the Lisbon Strategy too fast , without carrying out a thorough analysis of why the objectives of this strategy were not achieved
a separate debate
They contain at least two points on which European policy has been successful so far: creation of the internal market and the cohesion and structural policies
However , the EU 2020 strategy indicates that the Cohesion policy will only have a supporting role in the attainment of its objectives
Now , that is a contradiction
We do not need more planned economy in the European Union; others have failed on that front before
can create more community without infringing the subsidiarity principle
If we did so , this debate could and would culminate in an overall strategy
it
the service of European citizens
We have said a great deal about the economic and social dimensions of the Europe 2020 strategy
However , the European Union today is much more than that
The EU is not just a community of interests but one of values; that is what gives it its economic strength and political clout
values receive due respect , are strengthened and implemented
the protection of fundamental rights and minority rights , to mention but a few policies that are based on European values
Economic growth and the improvement of citizens' living conditions are unthinkable without such values-based policies
(FR) Madam President , Commissioner , the 2020 strategy is comprehensive and covers many issues , as demonstrated by this afternoon's debate
I should just like to emphasise two particular aspects
targets in this strategy , which , for me , is a sine qua non
Also , the principle of an EU-wide minimum income to meet these objectives seems to me to be an obvious need , and must be implemented in practice
Secondly , the coherence between the EU budget and this strategy
it has revealed its limitations
However , if we do not adapt it in accordance with the new challenges in the strategy , we are collectively running a great risk
the 2020 strategy
Madam President , on page 7 of the Europe 2020 document , it says: 'Europe has many strengths: we can count on the talent and creativity of our people'
out the population of Europe for special praise
Elsewhere , it bemoans the fact that Europe has an ageing population
This , of course , is attributable mainly to sharply falling birth rates , though the document does not say so
Perhaps nation states should encourage , as far as states can , a rise in the birth rates of their populations
This would certainly redress the population balance
Furthermore it might even produce at least a proportionate increase in those talented and creative people who are so necessary for economic and cultural development
I do hope I am not tainting the Commission document by linking its parts with reasoned argument , but I have kept within my time limit
(PL) The Europe 2020 strategy cannot do as much as we are saying , here , today
It is not possible to do so much for just under 1% of GDP , because that is the value of the European Union budget
budget
created , and the role of Member States has not been defined
the economy today
(RO) The EU's Cohesion policy has helped , and still helps , generate synergy with the research and innovation policies
It has also placed the focus on the role of territorial cohesion
channel Community resources into these priorities which have been identified
those established via public-private partnerships
tangible results at regional level
All these elements form the concrete bond for achieving territorial cohesion within the European Union
(RO) I wish to congratulate today's rapporteurs , especially Mr van Nistelrooij , for the excellent report that was presented
severe economic crisis or achieving the 2020 strategy's long-term objectives
directions
and sustainable development
as possible
regional and local potential
(RO) The European Union is facing an economic , financial and social crisis at present
unemployment rate , which is even 20% among young people , thereby jeopardising the EU's competitiveness
I believe that the European Union needs to make huge investments in the transport and energy infrastructure , in agriculture , health , education and research but , above all , in sustainable economic development
production
In the next 10 years , energy efficiency must be our top priority
On top of this , the EU population is ageing and the birth rate is falling , while the high unemployment rate is affecting the sustainability of the pension systems
million European citizens
(DE) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we are talking about the Europe 2020 strategy and its key priorities
There is a lesson to be learned from the Greek crisis: we need to act instead of reacting
A coordinated and monitored budgetary policy and supervision and regulation of the financial market are indispensable
For the sake of our citizens , we need to pay attention to investment in growth and employment , in order to reduce unemployment and to create and secure jobs
conscious economy
(SK) The 2020 strategy and the Lisbon Strategy have something in common: a belief that the economy must be managed
The Commission's recipe of 'competition or crisis' unfortunately remains unchanged
The 2020 strategy states that easy access to credit and short-term thinking resulted in the behaviour which led to unsupported growth and major imbalances
enterprises to access finance
This has again sanctioned greater access to credit , which will again lead to speculation and unsupported growth

Ladies and gentlemen , planned economies do not work , as all of our colleagues from the new Member States , including the Commissioner , can confirm
Member of the Commission
- Madam President , this discussion today on the Europe 2020 strategy has been extremely interesting and useful for us , the Commission , as was this morning's discussion on economic governance
I would like to thank you for this opportunity and for all the messages you sent on this strategy
On behalf of the European Commission , I am particularly grateful to Mr van Nistelrooij , Mr Grech , Mr Cort√©s Lastra and Mr Hoang Ngoc for their reports
I am prepared to continue a discussion on various details and even nuances concerning the Europe 2020 strategy
However , at this time , let me concentrate my answers on some of the key aspects of the discussion with a few concluding remarks
Union through the Europe 2020 strategy
Let me also be very clear about the objectives of the strategy
It has a dual objective
First and foremost , it is an essential pillar of the response of the Union to the current crisis
It is an essential tool for strengthening coordination of economic policy inside the EU-27 and , of course , within the euro area
- to enable the European Union to exit the economic crisis by restoring economic growth and making sure this growth translates into more and better jobs
financially sustainable
of tackling climate change , an EU that invests more in its people through more and better education and , finally , an EU that strengthens social cohesion by combating poverty
the revenue side
These are all very important elements
attention to the fact that this financial and economic crisis is much more complex than just speaking about budget deficits
we want to start a sustainable recovery from this situation
of our previous strategies - to achieve a knowledge-based economic growth and spread this growth to every region , every corner of the European Union
That is why we have to reinforce our efforts in terms of economic governance , reinforce our efforts for financial regulation , and also achieve better economic , social and territorial cohesion
Altogether , I strongly believe that there is no alternative for Europe but to launch this strategy and to launch it very quickly
If Europe does not restore its growth path , it will decline economically and will therefore also decline politically
already implementing them
this Lisbon Strategy is exposed to too harsh a criticism - it is that delivery of reforms is key for success
It is therefore urgent to launch Europe 2020 at the June European Council and make sure that both the EU and its Member States start the implementation immediately thereafter
months and , no doubt , in the coming weeks
There can be no delay , considering the current economic situation and the crisis we are currently going through
a return to smart , sustainable and inclusive economic growth
By acting together in a coordinated way , we will have the necessary weight to be successful on the global stage as well
The Commission counts on Parliament's support in making sure the Europe 2020 strategy can be launched rapidly and successfully
Following the debate , I should like to express my thanks for your support for my report
I wish to make a couple more comments; to raise a few points about social and economic governance in the short term
The financial side has attracted sufficient attention and has been made a major priority
We have also been able to discuss the medium term this afternoon and make several comments on this
We shall be including everything in a Parliament resolution that we shall be discussing in this Chamber before the June summit
I wish to make two more comments: one about governance
It has been asked whose strategy this actually is
One of Lisbon's faults was that the decentralised parties - the municipalities , the regions , our partners - were not sufficiently involved in the process
Therefore , I propose a territorial pact with the regions , towns and cities , in addition to the agreement in the Council with the Member States and the Commission
Otherwise , this will happen again , and we shall be talking about , rather than to , the regions , our partners
more flag than ship
Participation in the Lisbon Strategy and the EU 2020 strategy should be made more exciting
Indeed , this is possible , by saying when it comes to providing subsidies , providing encouragement , that those who stick their necks out , who also provide financing , can participate
The whole thing is far too flat
Therefore , I invite the Commission to enter into a territorial pact with the regions , towns and cities
Finally , integrated policy , particularly across sectors , is crucial; the fragmentation of all kinds of new financing structures does no good and will not help us achieve this agenda
My report concerns synergy between research , development , innovation , production and employment in Europe
sometimes suggested in this House
In the little time I have available , I would like to reply to a few of my fellow Members' comments on my report
which is still not properly defined and developed
initiatives to provide European citizens with a better quality of life within the Union's strategy
leadership on the part of all the Union's institutions , especially from the Commission's side , so that the Single Market can once again restore confidence and trust in our citizens
nothing gets implemented , as happened the last time round
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , two taboos have been broken in recent weeks
Firstly , the ECB can now monetise sovereign debts
Secondly , EU expenditure can now be financed by borrowing and , in particular , when the stabilisation and support funds are created
There is a third taboo , which unfortunately has not been broken , and it is the Stability and Growth Pact , which some Members of this House are dogmatically demanding be strengthened
Commissioners , we socialists are in favour of federalism
We are in favour of the coordination of budget policies
fine EU idea which will itself end up starving to death
This is the real threat which we are all facing at the moment
Commissioners , the austerity plans in Greece , Spain , Portugal and France do not have any chance of succeeding
I ask you to acknowledge this
Madam President , I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their contributions and the climate of constructive criticism that has prevailed during the course of this important debate
2020 strategy for growth and employment , one of the priorities of the Spanish Presidency

being in a position to establish a direct link with universities and innovation centres , thus promoting the knowledge triangle
In this context , Cohesion policy is not merely a source of stable financial allocations , but also represents a powerful tool in the economic development of all European regions
are all essential elements to the success of the Europe 2020 strategy

Written statements (Rule 149)
The EU 2020 strategy's principles are vital for boosting the European economy's competitiveness
Structural reforms are the key to exiting the crisis we are in
The solutions deployed so far for exiting the crisis have not been targeting the causes which have put us in this situation
The causes of the crisis can only be eliminated through structural reforms
We must focus more attention on our economies' innovative ability because this is where the key to EU competitiveness will lie in the coming period
We need to adopt a coordinated approach for using funds earmarked for innovation and regional development
Innovation must feature as part of regional development
Innovation was an objective in the Lisbon Strategy but , unfortunately , it only remained a principle on paper
There were very wide variations in the progress made by Member States and the overall objective was not achieved
This is the reason why I am urging all Member States to show some responsibility and abide by the commitments which they also take on
The Commission should also play a more active role in coordinating the implementation of this strategy in order to prevent it from failing as disastrously as the Lisbon Strategy
The EU 2020 strategy proposed by the European Commission to stimulate growth and employment in the EU emphasises research and innovation
Development and the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme
These various programmes provide finance to the tune of EUR 86 billion for the period 2007-2013
The EU 2020 strategy also emphasises the interdependence of the various EU policies
For efficiency purposes , it is therefore essential to establish synergies between the various instruments
EU 2020 strategy objectives
I also agree with the rapporteur that potential beneficiaries are not always fully aware of the possibilities that exist for establishing synergies in the area of funding
I therefore think it crucial to improve communication , for example , on the model of the Practical Guide to EU Funding Opportunities for Research and Development
for innovative solutions which arise in individual Member States
the Member States
This is a waste of EU money , which we cannot allow in a time of economic crisis
innovative businesses
the sector concerned , contribute to creation of the competitive advantage of the European Union on a global scale
It is also essential to create incentives to investment in local research centres

the report by Mr Cort√©s Lastra , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development , on the contribution of the Cohesion policy to the achievement of Lisbon and the EU 2020
Following this morning's debate on the support package and on tighter , sounder financial and economic governance , we are now discussing a number of underlying dossiers that are important as
Parliament wishes to expressly steer these proposals by the Commission and , particularly , the Council; it is unacceptable for the Council to take decisions in June without us having expressly reached
Well , then , both the Cort√©s Lastra report and my report on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development concern policy synergy with a view to increasing output , or results , for
We have taken a proper look at how things work in the fields of research and development , regional policy and small and medium-sized enterprises , and I wish to thank
my fellow Members , including those from the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy - the committee with joint responsibility in accordance with Article 50 - for helping us achieve a
Although we are very good at investing in research , we are lagging behind in the utilisation of this research , in bringing innovation to the market and , subsequently , keeping high-quality
We need to focus on a number of areas in order to achieve a large-scale effect; we need the courage to specialise production in a region - incidentally , the
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the own-initiative report on which we are voting this week is of particular symbolic importance at a time when the markets are unable to assess
Having demanded severe budget adjustment policies , they now doubt the capacity of Member Sates to kick-start their growth and , hence , to obtain the tax revenue necessary to pay the interest
We therefore suggested ratifying the principle of anti-cyclical budgetary policies , which were successfully established during the first phase of the crisis in 2008 and 2009 , and which are in
These policies entail using automatic stabilisers , in other words , in earmarking surpluses from the primary budget for debt repayment at the top of the cycle , and in allowing Member States
This is why , in our report , we proposed that particular attention be paid to the structural deficit indicator rather than the focus being on the current account deficit , the scale
The second is to monitor the structural deficits , which are still close to equilibrium , despite the deterioration in actual budget deficits , in order to send a reassuring signal to
Unfortunately , for the liberals and the conservatives in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , common sense counts for little; the impact of the crisis counts for little; and the
It is a case of putting Europe on a starvation diet and doggedly trying to meet the criteria in the pact without any guarantee of success and at the
If you and your group are not up to this task , if you are no longer capable of representing the general interest , you can be sure that our citizens
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would first like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and their assistants , the Secretariat of the Committee on Regional Development for their contributions , as
well as the European Commission's Directorate-General for Regional Policy and the Directorate-General for Employment , Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities , the European Economic and Social Committee , the Committee of the Regions ,
I had meetings with several regional associations and institutions while preparing this report , especially the Committee of the Regions , the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions , the Assembly of European Regions ,
the European Regions Research and Innovation Network , the European Economic and Social Committee and the European Commission's Directorate-General for Regional Policy and its Directorate-General for Employment , Social Affairs and Equal
Having changed the title , which now includes the reference to the Europe 2020 strategy , the main aim of the report is to defend Cohesion policy as a strong , well-financed policy ,
The first part of the report makes a brief analysis of the contribution of the Cohesion policy to the Lisbon Strategy and points to the limitations of the involvement of
The second part deals with recommendations for the future Europe 2020 strategy and highlights the importance of the regions , multi-level governance and the principle of partnership , basic pillars of the
Moreover , it is essential that the participation of the social and economic actors , as well as those of civil society in general , be strengthened in order to avoid the strategy
This part underlines the key role of education , training , research and innovation , the importance of facilitating the establishment of the so-called knowledge triangle , and the need to support small and
Specifically , in order to foster the leverage effect of investment in research and development , in education and in training , we defend the need to increase the synergies between the National
The European Investment Bank plays , and must continue to play , an important role by means of the financial engineering , cooperation and support instruments in supporting the regions and small and
In conclusion , the report defends a solid and well-financed Cohesion policy for the future , one that is present in all European regions and which has a key role to play
Mr President , in essence , my report is concerned with the protection of the Single Market from a micro perspective , to regard the market as a single project and to take
Strategies and courses of action that are intended to breathe new life into the European Single Market and the European Market ought to be based on a pragmatic , extensive and
Europe needs to develop 2020 strategies enabling the market to be the leading agent in economic regeneration while , at the same time , generating acceptance by the citizens by protecting their
It is also encouraging that I received positive reactions from Commissioner Barnier and Commissioner Dalli regarding my proposal on the top 20 frustrations as expressed by European citizens , on
We need to adopt a truly new political line of thought that is based upon consumer protection and the social dimension , which will serve to draw up the laws and
Every effort that is wasted by trying to explain away the Single Market in a dogmatic fashion will be underestimating the challenges , inconsistencies , interests , differing beliefs and perplexities that
The Single Market is not an end in itself but an instrument that has to contribute in a significant manner to a better quality of life for all European citizens
So as to guarantee a viable and strong Single Market , we need to reconcile what Mario Monti referred to in his analytical and stimulating report as the tensions between market
In the final analysis , the predominant system is one that succeeds in striking a balance between a vibrant and competitive economy that incentivises innovation and job creation and which
I am very happy to share this debate with all these European Parliament initiatives , but I do feel as though I am in a melting pot which I am
On the other hand , I hope that you share my concern , Mr President , because , on behalf of this House , you raised an extremely important question with President Van Rompuy , on
With regard to the adoption of the employment guidelines , this year - dare I say it , as an exceptional measure - as part of a special partnership between the Commission
and the European Parliament , and in a spirit of good cooperation with the Council , bearing in mind the somewhat revised timetable - the employment guidelines are normally published at the
end of the previous year; this year , they were published in April and , even though they commit us to a long cycle for the years to come , we will have
to deliberate them before the spring European Council - you kindly supported , on behalf of us all , the request we sent to President Van Rompuy calling for the European Council
As regards the challenge of these employment guidelines , which will be a factor in the implementation of the 2020 strategy , we must draw the attention of the authorities to their
importance at a time when 17% of Europeans are living below the poverty line - I would point out that these figures are taken from 2007 , that is to say ,
We do not understand how this issue can be the subject of discussions , hesitations and the calling into question of the Union's competences within the Council , when the treaty
Then , the other issue relates to the relationship and consistency between the various policies , because the Commission clearly tells us that it has fundamentally changed things in this 2020 strategy ,
The reality is that those who are currently suffering the most as a result of the crisis , those who will be hardest hit , are the ones who actually create
The fact is , we are seeing debates starting up here and there which are liable to go against Europeans' very interests , because they would lead to a reduction in investment
This is why , faced with this challenge , the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs calls on the authorities to be aware of how public investment might be reduced in these
This is a crucially important timetabling issue , and we cannot but regret that the Ministers for Economic and Monetary Affairs were able to argue for a withdrawal of non-conventional employment
support and unemployment reduction measures , when the Ministers for Social Affairs had not been consulted in what we know is a tragic employment and social affairs situation in our European
- Mr President , the EU 2020 strategy proposes action to enhance the performance of education systems , reinforce the attractiveness of Europe's higher education , open up more mobility and training
This has been endorsed by the Spring Council , which stated that key objectives requiring action at EU level included better conditions for research and development , improved education levels , a reduction
For instance , Latvia is suffering a deep economic crisis and it has faced severe budget cuts in the country's 34 higher education institutions with a threatened 50% cutback to
Irish universities face a 6% cut , and Britain is not exempt from this because in England , the Higher Education Funding Council reckons there may be a cut of up
I am therefore asking for the Commission to explain , firstly , how it intends to ensure that Member States make good on their commitments to the educational goals in the
2020 strategy by ensuring that this area receives sufficient support and funding and is not forgotten amid the rush to balance the books in the light of the economic crisis
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the Commission , and of President Barroso , I should like to make a few comments about the 2020 strategy and echo the very
interesting reports from Mr Grech and Mr Hoang Ngoc; next , my colleagues and friends , Commissioners Hahn and Andor , will speak in turn - in this debate in which we are
On behalf of all three of us , please allow me to thank all the rapporteurs and Parliament for this initiative , which is being taken at an extremely serious and challenging
time for all of us , at a time of economic crisis , with the recent difficulties of the euro , which clearly highlight the interdependency of all our Member States and the
It is obvious that we have to put in place instruments for improved coordination of our economic policies , and we think that this Europe 2020 strategy may be the
Within the next year , we will have put all the necessary legislative proposals on the table , so that we can formalise the commitments we made together at the G20
With regard to several of these issues , which have already been considered in the legislative debate , I truly hope that Parliament and the Council will be able to rapidly
The debate , this afternoon's debate in fact , demonstrates this: the relaunch of the internal market , regional policy for all the regions , including the most distant ones , such as the
I think that this 2020 strategy must enable us to have a better perspective on the economic policies of our Member States , in order to avoid certain imbalances or
These imbalances have been very obvious in the current crisis but , at the same time as urgently addressing this crisis , we must work on the economy in the medium
This is why , on the basis of the Commission proposals , the European Council adopted five common objectives: an employment rate of 75% , 3% of GDP invested in research and
development , as well as a restriction on leaving school too early , increasing the number of people with a university diploma to 40% , and the 20-20-20 targets in the field of
I should also like to commend the Monti report presented a few days ago , and I wish to pay homage to the intelligent work of Mr Grech , who is
The latter will have to submit national reform programmes between now and the end of the year in a coordinated fashion , with a stability and convergence programme , while also
To conclude , the European Parliament is playing its role , and we thank it for doing so , for mobilising the citizens , in particular , via the national parliaments; I was very impressed
by the initiative taken by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and its Chair , Malcolm Harbour , on the Services Directive , which brought together national parliaments and the
To conclude , I should like to confirm that the Commission will do as you wish and play its role in a purposeful manner so as to implement this strategy and
The problem which all the questions asked in recent weeks have been about is whether there is a sufficient degree of coordination , as was the case even up to now
Alternatively , many more functions need to be transferred , not only coordination , but also decision making at European level so that Europe can set itself much more ambitious tasks and
Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , I am very pleased to see Mr Hahn , Commissioner for Regional Policy , and Mr Barnier , Commissioner for the Internal Market , sitting side by side
Europe 2020 is a project for growth and employment and we need concrete projects , we need the instruments , we need the procedure , we need mechanisms for sanctions , so that
I am convinced that we will only be able to implement Europe 2020 if we are ready , if Europe is ready to think of the EU in terms of
That presupposes reinforcing and expanding the monetary union , reinforcing and expanding the internal market , unfettering it and calling on people to use the opportunity that is Europe , to use
We therefore need a financial review , an EU impact assessment , implementation of the Small Business Act and , obviously , very specific European projects for growth and employment and the expansion of
Mr President , I would like to ask Mr Karas if the United States of Europe to which he referred in his speech is going to take place with the consent
(DE) Mr President , each one of us who represents the citizens of Europe and is constantly in contact with them has one objective: working with the citizens of Europe in
Unless we take action together to become stronger and if each person looks after their own interests , this Community will not be reinforced , but weakened , in these times of
It is a serious problem that so many of the decisions continue to be short-sighted and governed by a right-wing philosophy where economies in crisis are put on a starvation
It is also a serious problem that we are discussing Greek pensions instead of the behaviour of the big bankers and of the players in the property and financial
We need to correct this situation or else the Europe that we will see in 2020 will perhaps be in a worse crisis than the one we are in
I call on the Commission to make a serious effort to bring about a change of course so that we abandon our blind faith in market solutions , we regulate the
This may mean the transport system , it may mean energy supplies , it may mean other important solutions where the Member States cannot stand alone but where the EU and
I also call on the Commission to show the workers of the EU the respect that will be required in this economic crisis in order to bring them with us
I must commend the Liberal Commissioner , Neelie Kroes , on being the first to really outline a clear flagship proposal on the digital agenda , and I am looking forward to having
We need transparency , and we need the same kind of statistics and we need sticks and carrots for Member States , not only to sign up to promises , but also
There is a very interesting aspect in Mr Monti's report , and that is the emphasis it places on the pressing need for us to move on to the next stage
It clearly explains that the Stability and Growth Pact criteria do need to be applied , but that if they are applied solely to expenditure , through cuts in expenditure , this
It is therefore crucial to use both pillars and , in particular , the fiscal pillar , to enable the Member States to collect a number of additional receipts from the economic
Do this , and this will establish the link - Mrs Ber√®s was just saying that this debate is a bit like a melting pot; fiscal coordination will help establish
We are well aware that , if we abide by the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact - which , incidentally , is vital - but do so only by cutting expenditure ,
How are you going to convince your colleagues - assuming that you are already convinced yourself - of the need for an action plan , for a fiscal coordination plan
- Mr President , first of all , on behalf of my Group , I particularly wanted to welcome all the reports , but especially the report from Mr Grech , for which I
I want to refer to some points on that in a moment but I just want to support what Mrs Ber√®s said about the wide-ranging nature of the debate
There are some really important contributions from many colleagues but , frankly , and I say this to the Commission and Commissioner Barnier , this also reflects the nature of the EU
So the first point I make is , please , can we ensure that the Council does not adopt in detail this proposal at its next meeting in June , because it is
Colleagues , you heard from Mr Grech that the potential is there to create jobs , to encourage more innovation and to move towards a more sustainable economy but we need
We have this instrument of huge potential and , particularly with public budgets still amounting to 16% of the European economy , why are we not using our public procurement budgets
Mr President , we are in the middle of the most fundamental crisis the European Union has witnessed in its history and yet almost all decisions on the strategic direction are
Time and again , the entire debate today has circled around specific issues concerning the Europe 2020 strategy for employment and growth , which gives the false impression that we are talking
We might be able to ask oral questions about the political relevance of the EU 2020 strategy in the context of the current economic and financial crisis , but we
Instead of being involved in this strategic cross-roads , what we have experienced on almost every single point that we have debated here in this House in recent months is getting
Both the EU 2020 strategy and , for example , the integrated employment guidelines , which the Chair of the Employment Committee has spoken about , regard Parliament as a body that is
In the last parliamentary term , the European Parliament put specific demands to the Council and Member States concerning the fight against poverty , the introduction of minimum income benefits and an
On the contrary: there is even the risk that objectives , such as the fight against poverty and the reduction of poverty by 25% , may even disappear from the current
However , the huge rise in atypical jobs should lead us to set up a model in the strategy and in the guidelines which is directed at secure and poverty-proof
However , as long as the European Union , the institutions and their specific policies do not send out signals to those who are marginalised , who live in poverty or who have
no work , or to young people who have no future prospects , we will not be able to win these groups over to the idea that a common European Union is
It is to be welcomed that Member States are to call each other to account more intensively in a Council context regarding the structural reforms needed to put their public

Moreover , let us now take a look at the list of countries wanting to join the EU , with whom we sit round the table every day: Albania , Bosnia , Turkey
In addition , every day in this Chamber we hear members of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in
the European Parliament , and even the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , say that we need a green economy , that we must provide billions of euro
There is only one recipe for an economically strong Europe , and that is less bureaucracy and fewer officials in Brussels , and also less bureaucracy in the Member States; tax
Let us hold up a mirror to ourselves for once and look at the MEPs here: what have you done in recent years to hold Greece to its commitments
You have all been asleep here while countries such as Greece , which have received billions from Europe each year , have squandered that money and let the government grow out
I would say that we need to discuss the 2020 strategy , but we need even more a 2010 strategy , describing the action that needs to be taken now in

The European Commission did not want to analyse the causes of the current situation or make anything of the consequences of the cornerstones of the policies that it followed
What they are now aiming for is to open the way for greater concentration of wealth using various directives that will facilitate the privatisation of strategic sectors of the economy ,

In your report , you also quite rightly point out that an adequate assessment of the social , consumer-related , environmental and economic impacts of the internal market , and the decisions we make

I am sure it is no secret that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would have liked to have seen a much more ambitious 2020 plan than is
To this , I would simply say that there is a legal basis for this in numerous places in the new Treaty of Lisbon , for example , in Article 3 of
Europe is currently in the midst of an economic crisis , but we must not allow it to give us a mental block and make us afraid to set ambitious
In my opinion , however , we should first have put the question of desirable future development to our citizens and to those it concerns most closely , in other words , mayors

If we want to avoid repeating the failure of the Lisbon Strategy , we must not continue to ignore the voice of local authorities , who form part of public administration in
In essence , the Commission's proposals as a whole do not overturn the current objectives , and not only were these objectives not attained , but progress over the last ten years
In our opinion , if the Stability Pact is not replaced by a pact to achieve social objectives , the noose around the people's neck will tighten still more and greater
(DE) Mr President , in the year of the World Cup , the ladies and gentlemen of the Council could learn a lesson from football and that is that it is not
(FR) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the economic and financial situation in Europe fully justifies the drastic measures which have been taken , in particular , to stabilise the euro area
However , when it comes to implementing the adopted measures , it should be ensured that Parliament is involved , within the scope of its powers , and can exert its democratic control
In this regard , I should like to congratulate you , Commissioner , on your determination , and to encourage you to continue with the work programme which you have set out , in accordance
This is not a question of bullying the finance sector , but of establishing the rules to ensure that an activity which should be regulated is regulated , and of making
The events of the past weeks with regard to the Greek crisis - and here I would disagree with Mr Gauz√®s , since unfortunately , the European Union and the Member
This is an extraordinarily dangerous turning point , one that will determine whether we will move in the direction of renationalisation , national withdrawal and egoism , or in the direction of
It is very important that we do not forget , when setting out new objectives , about our previous policy , the Cohesion policy , the common agricultural policy or , if I look
In this connection , it is important to remember what has happened in Europe in recent weeks , where we have an economic crisis , the like of which we have seldom seen
It was therefore perhaps a little surprising that we had such major ideological differences about whether it was actually judicious to borrow and spend as much money as many
It is important to remember that we are not only dealing with our current borrowing , but also with future challenges such as Europe's demographics , its ageing population and so
The EU should be encouraging a new economic dynamism in the European research area , creating networks for excellence , research clusters for integrated projects based on innovation in new products
With a little EU assistance , this hi-tech company cluster could be elevated to being a world-class centre , lifting an entire economy that currently qualifies for cohesion funds into a
(FR) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , you will not admit it , but the reality is blatantly obvious: the idea or , at least , the myth of a liberal Europe has run
How can anyone continue to believe in a deepening of its federal dimension when it is getting ready to fleece the most indebted countries to help out the financial
The end of the line for Europe is also apparent in the negotiations at the WTO and in the story regularly sold to us claiming that the EU will protect
In fact , we are now hugely vulnerable as a result of the EU , and we are now paying the price with the deindustrialisation process and the various forms of
For EU 2020 to be a success and for the mountains of cash that remain to be spent to be used to stimulate economic growth and support competition , two
Simplification will be a key to disentangling access to these resources from paralysing red tape: regions , citizens and businesses want to be able to act more freely to unlock their
Now as never before , our Cohesion policy needs to be able to prove its strength as a multilevel governance tool , by giving a genuine voice to the problems that affect
Ladies and gentlemen , it is the duty of anybody that , like the European Union , is responsible for handling these kinds of sums , to impose stringent supervision of the projects that
We therefore need to be able to win back the public trust , win the battles on stability , budgetary rigour , job creation , the stability of the monetary union , globalisation , strategic
However , I firmly believe that the Cohesion policy can , and will , make an enormous contribution to the Europe 2020 strategy , not just because we command a considerable budget in
comparison with other European policies but , above all , because the Cohesion policy allows us to have sustainable development in our regions and ensures good monitoring of the restructuring processes and
However , there is one core issue here that I would like to clarify once again , and that goes for our group as well: our Cohesion policy can only work if
As a result , I believe that local and regional authorities must be involved even in the drafting phase in order to guarantee that really effective results will be achieved
However , I want to draw your attention to the fact , once again , that we must avoid the pitfall of using these funds in future as a means for punishing
It does not matter whether we choose to call it intelligent , sustainable or inclusive , we are now in the grip of a crisis in Europe that will not come
The quantified targets for this 2020 strategy - increasing the employment rate , reducing the poverty rate , and so on - are just pious hopes , because they use the same
Should we not , at long last , set a target for enhancing Europe's cultural diversity , a founding value of the EU , which could provide the raw material , unequalled on any
Macro-regional strategies which reorganise land use policies around the continent's life-sustaining natural basins , which are also its cultural and historic centres - the Baltic Sea , the Western Mediterranean , the
This approach is gradually being adopted , for example , in the Baltic Sea , but it has not been taken up in the 2020 strategy , and therefore could very well be nipped
With this in mind , we should appreciate the amendments adopted by Parliament to the Commission's proposal which , in particular , concern strengthening the common market , reducing protectionism , continuing Cohesion policy
However , and this still needs to be stressed , there is a need to conduct climate policy more fairly , in other words , in a way which does not , by its excessive
Finally , I would like to point out that the central concept of European Union strategy is innovation , but we should remember to continue Cohesion policy and support for agriculture , because
In particular , this strategy should guarantee conditions that place small and medium-sized enterprises on an equal footing with their competitors outside the EU by adopting safeguard clauses and strong , effective
It is important that governance of the Europe 2020 strategy should not rest in the hands of the Commission alone , but should be carried out at different levels , including
We need to start formulating a policy and strategy that focus on the local level and the reality of manufacturing on the ground , and I would like to stress here
In other words , we are asking for more attention to be paid to the actual manufacturing situation on the ground , focusing , in particular , on the SME structure , as I
said , which is the backbone of manufacturing in every country in Europe and is therefore where the real hope for the future of manufacturing and development of the European Union
The problems that we are currently seeing in Greece , and will perhaps also see in a number of other countries before too long , are the result of two things:
the lack of competitiveness in Europe and the fact that Europeans have been living beyond our means , in other words , we have spent more money than we have earned and
Many economists like to make economics more complicated than it is , but the explanation is quite simple: the markets have simply lost their belief that Europe's debt-ridden countries can compete
Many small and medium-sized enterprises are excluded from public invitations to tender , both in the Member States and , in particular , when it comes to EU tenders , where large undertakings
After the action that has been taken in setting up the fund to defend the euro in order to help those countries in difficulties and to stop speculation , discussions
We have focused our attention so narrowly that the issues of the finance and banking system and the related problems of oversight and regulation have been put to one side
Without proposals relating to growth - I am thinking about the fiscal uniformity that Mr Monti has been talking about; investment resources; making eurobonds available and cohesion instruments , as
It is therefore curious , to say the least , for the rapporteur , Mr Hoang Ngoc , to want to tone down - and even remove - strict requirements for the Stability
They were heading towards 2 000% , which meant we were well on the way to banana republic status , but even the 500% rates were not enough - our currency
The question is: is the corporate responsibility of companies included in their obligation to function as part of society or do they consider it acceptable to behave as competitors
Our Member States also need to access those global capital markets and , whilst all eyes are focused on the European Stabilisation Fund , and whether it has achieved any current
reduction in the immediate volatility , fundamentally , long-term confidence will only be achieved if , as well as this ambitious growth , our deficits are brought under control and public finances themselves are
I thank also all those who have been intensively involved in this work because they will have a major say in the shaping of regional policy and because both
reports have shown how important it is to consider all regions in Europe and that regional policy can and must be a policy for all regions , and that in future ,
It was , after all , not just the idea , but the subsequent implementation of the concept of earmarking that has made a significant impact here , especially in the fields of
However , the regions that have local structures and individual project developers have had , and will have in future , the possibility of carrying out individual projects and achieving objectives under
In addition , the strategic report I recently presented on the reports of the 27 Member States concerning the state of implementation hitherto of the current programming period shows how sustainable
and sensible earmarking actually has been , because EUR 63 billion of the EUR 93 billion allocated so far has been spent on Lisbon objectives , that is , for research , innovation , investment
Regional policy - and this was shown very clearly by the van Nistelrooij report - is a driving force behind innovation which is able to move things forward and to
For this reason , it was obvious in the current programming period that we should allocate just EUR 86 billion for this area , which is three times more than in the
One of the major objectives should be , especially if we consider the next programming period , making a transition from a merely performance-based approach , which is to say , proper financial management ,
That must be one of EU 2020's major steps forward in comparison with Lisbon , one which really enables us to break down European objectives into national , regional and , ultimately ,
Finally , all regions can benefit from successful investments made in individual regions because , we have to keep remembering that two thirds of the European exports of each individual Member
Honourable Members , the first question is on how the Commission intends to strengthen the monitoring of the broad economic policy guidelines and how the Commission intends to ensure an active
In reply to this first question , I would like to refer to the Commission communication on Europe 2020 , in which the Commission proposes that the European Parliament should play an
The Commission also emphasises the importance of establishing a permanent dialogue between various levels of government , including national , regional and local authorities and national parliaments , as well as social
In the euro area in particular , a more far-reaching approach to the assessment of budgetary policies seems justified , including a more pervasive review of the weaknesses of national budgetary
Furthermore , in order to provide the right incentives for Member States to tackle fiscal imbalances , the functioning of the excessive deficit procedure could be improved by speeding up the
The third question concerns the differences between two Commission papers: on the one hand , the communication on public finances in the EMU 2006 of June 2006 and , on the other
The 2008 EMU 10 report is consistent with what was written at the time , for instance , on the relevance of long-term sustainability , on the need to set incentives in
We propose reinforcing the Stability and Growth Pact framework , both in its preventive and corrective dimensions; broadening the surveillance of macro-economic imbalances and competitiveness trends within the euro area; introducing
I think there are three important issues to be underlined here: first , the importance of financial regulation to create a much safer financial system; second , to make the fiscal
In line with the conclusions of the Spring European Council , in particular , as regards the headline targets for the Europe 2020 strategy , the Commission has started working with the
To facilitate this work , the Employment Committee Indicators Group has produced two alternative technical approaches that show what each Member State would need to do to ensure the EU
During the last week of April and the first week of May , the Commission and the Presidency held a round of bilateral discussions to exchange initial ideas on potential national
These discussions were very fruitful and allowed us to gain a first idea of where Member States stand and to understand the very peculiar economic circumstances that are a
The bilateral meetings showed that most Member States strongly supported the headline targets and were ready to set ambitious national targets to meet the headline targets set by the
Basing itself on the overall outcome of these meetings , the Commission will compile the results , which will then serve as an input for the various Council configurations in May
If there are discrepancies between the EU target and the sum of the national targets , we intend to continue the discussion with the Member States to see how national
While a number of delegations have expressed support for the Commission proposal within the Social Protection Committee , some insist on including a labour market dimension in the EU target
Support for the 'Youth on the Move' flagship initiative means strengthening the 'lifelong learning' and 'youth in action' programmes as well as the 'Marie Curie' and 'Erasmus for Entrepreneurs'
While I can understand that public spending needs to be diversified in order for Europe to fulfil its 2020 vision , I also believe that this spending needs to form
On the subject of jobs and training , it is essential that the European Union focuses on active and inclusive employment , that is to say , exploiting the full potential of all
those who can work , especially women , to promote the integration of those most alienated by the world of work and to supply them with all the necessary tools to help
Mr Commissioner , after having been in our respective posts for some weeks now , it is time to roll up our sleeves and get to work so that these objectives
(DA) Mr President , every day , thousands of jobs are lost in Europe , and the Europe 2020 strategy is intended to be the EU's answer to future challenges in this regard
We need to choose the route we are going to take: whether we will compete on the basis of low wages and poor working conditions or whether we will
The Commission must ensure that everyone is covered by the rules on migrant workers - by the rules applying at EU level - and the rules of the internal
They are looking for support from Member States and they are looking to the EU to put in place a framework that is conducive to job creation , to entrepreneurship
and to the support of SMEs , but crucially , that framework must link growth in the economy with the creation of decent jobs and an improvement in the well-being of all
This crisis is every bit as real and as immediate as the economic crisis and , while I heard the Commissioner's comments on youth initiatives and I welcome them , there
(PL) The 2020 strategy contains ambitious objectives with which it is difficult to argue , but the objectives are defined as if the European Union were already wealthy , free from worries
Meanwhile , we know there are many things to worry about and , above all , there are many differences between the level of development of the rich and poor countries and
I note with astonishment that among the priorities of the strategy , there is no place for the development of agriculture , while we know , after all , that by 2050 , the world
(EL) Mr President , before speaking about the 2020 strategy , an answer is needed , I believe , to certain points made earlier by one or two members about the position of the
The measures which are now being applied will certainly cause a deep recession and stagflation and the government decided on these measures itself , without any prior information or agreement
We support the need for strict financial discipline and a growth policy , so that Greece can break out of the vicious circle of deep recession and galloping inflation , with
That is why we need strong financial and economic governance because , without this 2020 strategy , it is at risk of failure and of following the precedent set by the
Yet it is also my duty to highlight the responsibility of the previous government , which massaged the figures over many years , and the fact that your party was in
The previous Greek Government took over an economy deeply in debt , very deeply in debt , an economy on rotten foundations , and these problems , chronic problems , deeply rooted over 30
Of course , mistakes were made by the previous government , but much bigger mistakes have been made , either due to weakness or due to a lack of courage , by the present
government , which was at least five months late taking the measures needed to contain the situation , and thus the deficit crisis , which exists in every country , as you know full
This is the answer which I am giving you with a view to our engaging in self-criticism; but this is where the ancient saying 'let he who is without
However , now that many Member States of the European Union , including those in the euro area , have come to this unsustainable situation , we cannot simply reverse the situation and
However , to demand the implementation of austerity programmes unscrupulously within European Union countries would mean condemning the entire European region to a long period of slow economic growth , if
We cannot afford to curb demand , even in countries which boast surpluses , both on an internal and external level , and which have the means to spend more and not
Mr President , we have quite rightly heard a lot about economic recovery in the Commission's proposal for the EU 2020 strategy but not enough , in my opinion , about poverty , and
We have to remember that the most vulnerable in society suffer in any economic recession more than anyone else , and that is why we have to put in place mechanisms
For instance , I would like to see a target of a 25% reduction of EU citizens living in poverty , as well as ensuring that those who are currently excluded
We all know it has not worked as well as it could have done , but I believe it can work well in the future if the right mechanisms are
(PL) The strategy is being adopted at the worst possible moment , when industrial production in Europe has fallen to the level of the 1990s and the gross domestic product of
The worst thing is that as many as four of the five priorities which have been presented to us as the main draught horses of European development are hard
Greece and its population are the victims today of a predatory economic and financial system , a system which has seen the G20 countries fork out , all in all , several
Speculators who greedily feed off the public should be outlawed; the casino banks that gamble with the lives and futures of citizens should be abolished; and the EU should
We can hold an extraordinary summit every Friday and release billions , but if we do not tackle the roots of the wrongdoing , one of these Fridays , we will end
This is why I highly rate the report on including the Cohesion policy among the objectives to be achieved by the Treaty of Lisbon and the 2020 strategy , which
We also need a strong Cohesion policy at the moment when the economic crisis is reducing the number of jobs and weakening our competitiveness and in the future too ,
In order to determine evaluation indicators , the Commission should consider and propose a clear definition of the concept of 'territorial cohesion' because this is precisely what appears in the
(HU) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to express my appreciation to the rapporteurs for their outstanding work and to thank the Commissioners for their
A few years ago , a good friend and mentor told me that throughout life , you will always come up against situations where you are either part of the problem or
It is hard to imagine that a community of more than 500 million citizens could identify with a strategy , based on a notion providing a recipe for resolving the
(IT) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the launch of the European Union 2020 strategy effectively marks the end of the previous Lisbon Strategy phase and it will have to tackle
I believe that if the 2020 strategy is to be effective , it must focus on two key aspects , the first being a system for evaluating progress which factors in the
use of the carrot and stick mechanism; the second being a vigorous policy of investing in infrastructure , in addition , of course , to tools for regulating the financial system and policies
The van Nistelrooij report should therefore be warmly welcomed since , in addition to providing an in-depth picture of the work that has been done to date in the Member
The harmonisation of rules , procedures and administrative practices for the management of EU projects and the simplification and streamlining of procedures are the solutions that the stakeholders on the ground
Europe thus punishes the next generation of Europeans by not allowing them to develop their talents and ambitions to their full capacity , and it allows China , India and the
Entrepreneurship , excellence and a sustainable future of the European economy can only be fostered if we are willing to invest in knowledge , because whoever thinks knowledge is expensive does

Despite all the necessary consolidation of national budgets - which is exactly what we are going through and debated this morning - there is one thing we must not seek
The EU 2020 strategy is a real opportunity to make Europe more social and we need that opportunity at this very moment when many hostile words are directed at Europe
I already pointed that out last Monday at the committee debate on employment policy guidelines: we must not lose sight of the goal of full employment , but we cannot have
We always say we need jobs , but what matters to me is that these jobs are good , that there is social security , that people do not have to receive
The ever more precarious nature of working life , the increasing income inequality and also growing poverty - which many speakers have talked about today - must finally be brought to
(PL) The economic crisis which has hit our continent has focused our attention - and rightly so - on rescuing the economies of Member States and building a common European
It is understandable that , today , the attention of Europeans is focused on increasing the speed of development and on job creation , but we cannot , when building a strategy for
After all , these priorities are going to influence distribution of the future budget , so we should maintain the possibility of financing such areas as development of cultural infrastructure and
In the European Union's 2020 strategy , we should emphasise the significant influence of culture on social and economic development in the Union , for after all , it is intellectual capital
Europe , today , is proud of projects such as the European Capital of Culture , but this is a project which was created by European cities , and it is these cities
(IT) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , 10 years since the introduction of the Lisbon Strategy and on the eve of the Europe 2020 strategy , in the middle of a
full economic , social and employment crisis , we know that we cannot come out of this crisis , nor lay the foundations for new and sustainable growth and a new social cohesion ,
In order not to fall within the limits revealed by the Lisbon Strategy , I believe that in this area , the Commission has to strengthen the open method of coordination
I do not consider it to be consistent for governments , as the Italian Government has done , to cut EUR 8 billion in three years from education and the universities , without
According to Professor Monti's report , currently , less than 3% of European workers in fact work in another Member State , and one of the reasons seems to be precisely this
Nevertheless , it is undoubtedly the case that that decade gave rise to hopes and aspirations , and that much was done to achieve the objectives that had been set , particularly
Today , we find ourselves at the beginning of a new , more problematic , more difficult decade , and as regards the proposals that have been presented to us so far , I partly
More jobs , more economic growth: this is the target that we must set ourselves , taking into account that we do so in a situation of excessive levels of public debt ,
Mr President , while Commissioner Reding confirmed , and President Barroso reconfirmed in his letter today , that the Women's Charter commits the Commission to promoting and ensuring gender equality and women's rights
If Europe wants to exploit all its potential and get out of the crisis , we need to ensure that the women's employment rate is raised to at least 70% -
We need to revalue the predominantly female health sector by increasing wages and improving conditions , as well as the availability of the services , as it is an increasingly important
We all know the failures of that strategy were caused , firstly , by basing the strategy on the responsibility of individual Member States in the open method of coordination , and
It now seems absolutely crucial , firstly , to show clearly that we are dealing with 'treaty' policies , which are not policies prepared for the purposes of a strategy , but operate
This means we need to use individual policies to put the strategy into effect , but the strategy , as previous experience shows , will only be successful if individual policies are
I would emphatically call on the Commission , first and foremost , to take steps to ensure rapid financial market regulation and progress in Europe in order to prevent , as has been
The decision makers in the European Union need to have quick reflexes , to act when needed , because if Mrs Merkel had decided in time and if the European Union
The underlying cause for our difficulties today is quite simple - European countries have been living beyond their means far too long , spending vastly more than they are able
A year and a half ago , Latvia experienced a crisis similar to the crisis that we are now experiencing in the rest of Europe; namely , the financial markets attacked
In my view , if we wish the Europe 2020 strategy to be meaningful , we must have as our first and most important priority the necessity for European countries to
These both demonstrate in a clear fashion the important contribution of Cohesion policy in achieving the goals of competitiveness and employment and the significant role in promoting innovation and
I urge the Commission to come up with proposals which will ensure a stronger delivery mechanism for the EU 2020 strategy to make sure that all its targets will
We all agree that the priority and the emphasis on the development triangle 'education , research , innovation' is the best investment if we are to get out of the crisis
At this point , I would clarify , for the avoidance of all misunderstanding , that the support mechanism for Greece , despite any delays , demonstrates this solidarity and you should be in
However , together with the sacrifices required , and which must be divided fairly , and on this point we were critical of certain measures , together with the spending cuts required in
order to reduce the debt and to reduce the deficit , growth initiatives which will take the country out of recession are also needed , initiatives which we have not seen to
That is the only way we , too , in Greece shall be able to approach the ambitious targets of the 2020 strategy , which is the only way we shall come
In future , structural funds should be properly financed , the structural funds should not be renationalised and the transitional status should be made available to those regions that fall out
(EL) I should like to take this opportunity , following the position taken by my close fellow Greek member , Mr Papanikolaou , from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) ,
The Member States of the European Union borrow at a lower rate of interest and lend , give money to the mechanism and , via it to Greece , at a higher
Of course , Greece's borrowing requirements would be smaller and Greece would be able to raise money more easily on the markets , had there not been such a delay , six
Let me also add a sentence from a famous German mayor who was chair of the German Association of Cities and Towns for many years: He who does not
However , I would like to highlight again the importance of towns and cities here , because they will play a key role in achieving the objectives of the EU 2020
In addition , Europe's towns and cities are key players in the fields of innovation , research and education , and therefore play a fundamental role in the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy
(IT) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the last two years have left millions of unemployed people in their wake , have been the cause of further national debt that will remain
We must react in a timely and incisive manner , and , in order to avoid making the errors of judgment that the Lisbon Strategy succumbed to , Europe 2020 must be extremely
I shall conclude by saying that the Greek crisis and the economic and employment crisis in the whole of Europe testify to the fact that in order to safeguard social
(FR) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are all agreed on the major objectives of the EU 2020 strategy and , if we are all agreed on its objectives , we should
In order for these fine words and major objectives to become realities and this time avoid what I would call a kind of collective disenchantment with the Lisbon Strategy , it
This is also why I fully support the Commission's proposal to have the national budgets inspected in advance by the EU , with the proviso , however , that the national parliaments
I think that young people have been the main victims of this crisis , and that we must take advantage of the opportunity provided to us to put young people
Furthermore , I also believe that this strategy must promote the upskilling of young people so as to eliminate the curse of unemployment among the young , because we all know that
I believe that this crisis has served to enable us to identify , in this new Europe 2020 strategy , where we went wrong , as well as enable us to improve
Finally , I would like to underline the important role to be played by European regions and towns and cities , and especially , the need to pay more attention to those areas
In short , if we want to be successful , we have to be able to count on the European regions , the towns and the cities and on a reformed Cohesion policy
It is important that , within the new European framework , we continue with the course of action promoting development and the objectives already set , which must be monitored for tangible
We need to continue to pursue economic , social and territorial cohesion policies in order to narrow the disparities between regions and establish a platform for balanced economic development , as is
Europe 2020 must be a Europe of global action which can be achieved if the European Union has a common level of development which enhances the ability of local and
We can see signs of that in the current Greek crisis and , here , we are all facing the problem of actually having failed to make our economy competitive enough
However , we must also put our own houses in order , and that means ensuring that we have better controls in place for how effectively money from relevant structural funds
We also need to involve local and regional authorities more in our structures and planning because , ultimately , they are the ones who have to implement tasks on the ground ,
However , setting objectives without robustly and consistently addressing the status quo and the tasks to be completed and without analysing what needs to be done now makes little sense
As Mr Ulmer said earlier on , we have moved on to the agenda and we are debating the day-to-day business of this House , food safety and so on , without really
We must also ensure that Parliament and , in particular , the Commission apply the control mechanisms that have been available to them in the past more stringently in the future
It was not all a failure and if it were , I do not think 67% of the Irish people would have voted in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon
I see each country coming in here outlining their priorities for the six months rather than where they fit into the overall targets set down annually for the 10
I think that is a very important point; no football team changes its manager every six months for him to come in with a different set of priorities which
(FR) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on 9 May , the EU , at the behest of the Ministers for the Economy and Finance , gave a firm response to the financial
Secondly , we must immediately set to work to find the solutions that will enable us , in the medium and long terms , to emerge from the crisis and encourage a
Mrs Bowles , I should like to say to you that , if the Lisbon Strategy is , to some degree , a failure , it is because it was designed several years ago when
Finally - and this is the most important issue to my mind - we must explain at a local level what is happening at EU level and obtain the public's
(IT) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I have listened a great deal today and it has been quite useful , but I also have to draw your attention to a
We shall not succeed , in my opinion , by locating all this strategy in the context of a market that is today out of joint , subject to continuous speculation , and
I would divide the discussion into two parts: first , the market must serve the real economy , and not vice versa; second , I believe that Europe must be the locomotive for
As far as the first part is concerned , it has been much discussed , and it is high time that we set up a hedge against this market , so that
Let us have the courage to change this budget , let us have the courage to take responsibility for setting up a significant fund to serve as a financial hedge , but
That is the task , Commissioner , which we must tackle immediately , because the crisis is not over , the crisis is with us , and we must make this strong push right
(PT) Mr President , a debate on the Europe 2020 strategy naturally leads to acceptance of better coordination of the various national policies , more Europe , and acceptance of the path of
However , in order for us to reach 2020 , we will have to get through 2010 and , on that subject , I would like to call attention to the balance needed
Fundamentally , the path that the Member States should choose is that of seriously reducing public spending: having tax systems that are competitive and making structural reforms so that we
(ES) Mr President , Commissioner , the future 2020 strategy must enable the European Union to correct the shortcomings detected in the Lisbon Strategy if we really want to create a competitive
In spite of the fact that the postulates of the by now outdated Lisbon Strategy are still valid , I would like to point out that one of the reasons why
it lost force was because of its highly complex structure , particularly its lack of clarity in defining the responsibilities and tasks incumbent upon the European Union and other levels of
I would like to point out that the resources invested from 2000 to 2006 by way of the European Regional Development Fund have enabled the creation of 1 400
(DE) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to extend a special greeting to the visitors to our Parliament who have followed this debate about one of the key
That is why I still have a certain scepticism for programmes which jumble together strategies , desired objectives and planned economy codes , which stretch over a lengthy period of time
No matter what decisions we make for the European Union in the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy , it is Member States , national governments and parliaments and regional and
Therefore , it is probably no coincidence that , today in Parliament , the reports and questions were lumped together under the title of 'EU 2020' , although every one of them deserves
Before we then confront Member States with a list of planned economy codes , which nobody at present knows how they are supposed to be achieved , and bearing in mind the
uncertainties and turbulence in the economic and financial markets now and in the past few years and their impact on jobs and the social situation in Member States , what we
need is an in-depth debate about where the European Union has been successful , where we can achieve common goals , for example , a pact with the EU's regions , and how we
However , this debate - as we have seen from the example today - has only just begun , and we in the European Union should be the ones to lead
(HU) Commissioner , I think that the guiding principle of any plan or strategy for European development must be to build a Europe that acts as a truly unified region in
If , by the end of the decade , we truly wish to create a more successful and competitive Europe , we need to pay serious attention to ensuring that our common
We also need to focus on closer harmonisation of Member States' education policies , the reduction of regional inequalities and the continuation of the enlargement process , as well as on
Firstly , with regard to the social dimension of this strategy , I fully support Mrs Ber√®s in her questioning of the Commission , in particular , concerning the setting of quantified poverty reduction
Neither the Council nor the Commission has given any indication so far as to whether it wishes to review our multiannual financial framework for the current period , even though
Neither the EU budget , which is too restricted , nor the national public budgets , will be able to start making the investments needed to support the various flagship initiatives in
It does not , of course , say that other people are less talented or creative - that would be terribly unkind and almost certainly unfair - but it certainly singles
Let us show what we can do , by creating appropriate and modern legislation , and let us show the purposes to which funds will be assigned from the European Union
Let us say clearly: there is not enough realism in our expectations of the Europe 2020 strategy , there are too many things to be done and too much hope being
A rise in employment , reduction in poverty , education and , above all , economic growth are the big tasks and the main priorities which should be put into effect in the
present situation , when we are in a crisis and should take action to revive the economy - because this is the number one problem in the Europe 2020 strategy: resuscitating
I believe that the regions should specialise in smart and green developments and define for themselves a set of innovation priorities based on the EU's objectives and their needs , and
At the same time , they must promote models of success as part of the triangle of knowledge and the relations between businesses , research centres , universities and public authorities , especially
I also believe that the exchange of knowledge within regional groups can be facilitated by the Structural Funds as well because European policies are consistently targeted at sustainable development , offering
Research and development will provide us with the solutions to be taken into account in future in tackling successfully the major challenges we are facing , whether it involves the
With the impetus provided by the Cohesion policy , whose aim is to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship and develop a knowledge-based economy , research and development must be approached from two
Based on a top-down approach , research and innovation will be the main areas for identifying solutions aimed at overcoming the problems which we are facing and for boosting economic growth
It is just as important for innovation to come out of the laboratories and research centres and be pitched at a level which suits European citizens' needs as appropriately
We must encourage local and regional economies to improve their ability to innovate and to identify themselves the most effective solutions as part of a bottom-up approach , thereby utilising
The policy of deindustrialisation pursued in recent years has resulted in the loss of millions of jobs , the relocation of European industry to third countries and to a 10%
The development of industrial production and , by extension , the creation of jobs in the EU requires investment in modernising European companies so that these developments can lead to greener
I believe that the time has come for the European Union to defend its fundamental principles and assets , and the biggest asset which the EU has is its 500
That also means strengthening the education sector and investing in education , research and innovation as cornerstones of a sustainable social market economy , and of a sustainable and more environmentally
However , further on in the text of the strategy , it states that the Commission will seek to improve access to capital and to make it easier for small and medium-sized
First of all , I would like to stress once again the importance of the strong involvement of the European Parliament in the various upcoming steps linked to the Europe 2020
strategy: first of all , the opinion of the European Parliament on the integrated guidelines; secondly , at a later stage , the role of the EP as colegislator on various proposals to
be made under the flagship initiatives; and not forgetting , thirdly , the next multiannual financial framework to make sure the future EU budgets better reflect the priorities set for the European
But besides this short-term objective , this new strategy is about equipping Europe with a strategy - actually , as Michel Barnier outlined in his opening statement , a programme for action
But we must aim for a different kind of job creation than in the past - a more sustainable one , not only in ecological terms but also economically , socially and
It is about restoring a competitive European Union capable of ensuring the sustainability of its unique social model - a competitive EU that is a global leader in terms
Of course , as outlined in the Commission's conclusions during this morning's debate , this return to strong growth is only possible if we make sure that in the coming years , our
Member States undertake the necessary fiscal consolidation , taking account of their respective starting points , not undermining a fragile recovery , and looking at the expenditure side at the same time as
I would like to stress once again the importance and the complexity of the fiscal problems that are currently on the agenda , but I would also like to draw your
At the root of the crisis , you will find a fundamental malfunctioning of the financial sector , starting with the banking sector , the correction of which is also essential if
We also have to address other causes of the recent recession - like the lack of an industrial policy and , to some extent , the lack of a complete success
While we are discussing this new strategy , most of our main trading partners have not only already put in place 10-year long-term social economic development strategies but they are
But , if there is one lesson to be learned from the current economic crisis and from its predecessor , the Lisbon Strategy - and I agree with Mr Kelly that often
At this point , I would also like to thank the Spanish Presidency for the efforts it made in bringing together the Member States and for supporting this strategy in recent
We owe it to the citizens to provide them with solutions to exit the current crisis and enhance the coordination of economic policies , while , at the same time , preparing
If these things do not reach citizens this time , I know one thing for sure , and that is that one can deck out large flagships , but they will soon be
We must fight against fragmentation , and so I urge Commissioner Andor to keep the European Social Fund intact in the regulations , and not to split it up as is
I agree with Malcolm Harbour in that there does not seem to be much willingness to consider the Single Market as being the fundamental tool in the 2020 strategy -
This is a real shame , considering that a Single Market that embraces a wider and more holistic perspective can be among the top - if not the top -
Evelyne Gebhardt is also right in saying that today , it is clear that the Single Market , within the scope of the 2020 strategy , requires new momentum that calls for strong
To conclude , Madam President , we need to ensure that the new 2020 agenda does not become over-ambitious and over-burdened , since this will lead to an agenda full of priorities where
However , if the coordination of budget policies means overriding national parliaments so as to put their citizens on a starvation diet , then I fear that that might be a
This report on the contribution of the Cohesion policy to Lisbon and Europe 2020 strategy objectives represents one of the key contributions of the European Parliament to the future Europe
The report highlights job creation , the fostering of a sustainable economy , education and training to promote development , employment and competitiveness , as well as the key role of investment in research
However , it will not be possible to implement the Europe 2020 strategy successfully without the participation and full approval of regional and local authorities , as well as that of civil
Regions not only contribute to project cofinancing , but are also capable of gauging the needs of citizens and small and medium-sized enterprises better due to their proximity , as well as
Its objectives of eliminating existing inequalities between regions and of introducing economic , social and territorial cohesion , along with its basic principles of an integrated focus , multi-level governance and genuine collaboration ,
Various instruments are already providing a great deal of support to projects being carried out in these fields: the Structural Funds , the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological
This being the case , I welcome the importance given by the rapporteur to the role which a strong , properly financed regional policy can play in the achievement of the
In the context of discussions on the effective use of all funds earmarked by the European Union for research and innovation , we have to raise the problem of appropriate promotion
It often happens that as a result of the poor flow of information , investment is made in research projects which have already been carried out by scientists in one of
Greater emphasis needs to be placed on improving communication and supporting the purchase by the European Union of existing new technologies , which will also allow additional financial support for
It is also important to finance soft projects such as training and the dissemination of knowledge about the significance of innovation for economic growth , better informing of local entities about
the programmes which are available , and also flexibility in defining the conditions for granting support , so that countries which currently have a low level of innovation can , by development of
Small and medium-sized enterprises cannot afford to do this , while large , international firms do not want to use them , which deepens the disproportions in the level of innovation between
Council Question Time
The next item is Question Time (B6-0437/2006)
We will be taking the following questions to the Council
Subject: Provision of services and freedom of movement for families with children
within the EU because they are accompanied by children under the age of 15
Recent articles in the Greek press have taken a positive view of the exclusion of children from commercial public premises such as hotels , restaurants , etc
What measures will the Council take to eliminate discrimination and age 'racism' against children , adolescents and their families
of young Europeans and their families
President-in-Office of the Council
and by the measures adopted to give it effect'
by the institutions pursuant to it are complied with
That being the case , the question by the honourable Member should really be put to the Commission
external policies of the European Union and supporting measures taken in this area by the Member States
Decisions on child and family policy proper are taken at national level
the Member States
question to the Council , in knowledge of the Treaties and the new Commission communication
President-in-Office of the Council
and occupation
They incorporate rules on such areas as the prohibition of discrimination in many everyday situations
from the perspective of families with children
prevalent , and where hotels count it as one of their main selling points that they allow no children , or will not accommodate families with them
What I would like to know is whether something can be done about this , at any rate as regards advertising
There are , after all , other areas in which advertising can be restricted , and that might be one possibility
President-in-Office of the Council
in what situation it is suitable when it is aimed at children
obviously consumer organisations and paying customers can have a say in what sort of services should be on offer
Subject: Reinforcement of FRONTEX
Frontex , the body responsible for monitoring the Union's external borders that was set up last year , has commenced its operations , but is under-resourced and notoriously ineffective
Will the Council propose the adoption of measures to increase the effectiveness of Frontex , whether by cooperation between Member States or by allocating additional resources at Community level
President-in-Office of the Council
of the European Union that provides for the establishment of Frontex and its tasks , structure and the requirements pertaining to its financial administration
budget
Measures to amend the Regulation's provisions may only be proposed by the Commission
It is primarily the task of Frontex's Management Board to approve measures relating to its organisational structure , staffing policy and action programme , and the Council takes no part in it
It is still the responsibility of the institutions of the EU to evolve Community policy on the control of external borders and relevant legislation
Close coordination between the agency and the institutions must therefore be assured , and there are arrangements in existence for this purpose under the Frontex Regulation
Border Intervention Teams
Its purpose is to enhance operative activities undertaken by the Agency and promote solidarity between Member States and the Community during a crisis
the Member States
These included strengthened control and monitoring of the EU's southern maritime border and the Medsea study on the Mediterranean Coastal Patrols Network , which Frontex has now completed
between the Member States and Frontex , and , in particular , the situation in the Mediterranean region and Africa
On these occasions such themes as Frontex's role and its participation in operative activities , especially in the Mediterranean and with regard to the African situation , were discussed
The Council was satisfied with the measures implemented by Frontex and the Commission and stressed that operative cooperation should continue to be developed further
At the end of October the Council also adopted its conclusions on strengthening the external maritime border in the south
the southern maritime border of the Community and the Mediterranean Sea
or sections thereof
The Council , however , does not have to propose that appropriations should be granted for Frontex's budget for additional action
the Hague Programme , the work of Frontex will be assessed with reference to a Commission evaluation before the end of next year
(ES) Madam President , the Council's reply has reassured me , and I am going to say something surprising: Frontex has worked
Despite being at an experimental stage , its work in the Canary Islands , in the large area of sea surrounding the Canary Islands , has been effective
The concern is the precariousness of the institutions and the lack of economic and financial resources
working , and is proving to be effective
President-in-Office of the Council
(FI) Madam President , first it is obviously encouraging to hear that Frontex has been successful
time , it has its administrative structure and tasks to attend to
Moreover , it has already been involved in very many operations both in the Mediterranean Sea and elsewhere
Obviously , whether the scope and effectiveness of this operation can continue also depends on additional financing
(DE) Madam President , the President-in-Office of the Council spoke about how difficult it is to get funding for Frontex
Frontex is being supported
the possible consequences of illegal immigration or of the other options available for legal immigration
Is it also considering reducing the load by taking action that would make it impossible , in future , to legalise illegal immigrants in the way in which they have been

origin and transit
able to enhance cooperation with countries of departure so that the pressures on people migrating are also lessened in those places
Of course , one area of this cooperation with countries of origin is to provide information on what is actually possible and what is not
In November the next high level conference between the EU and African countries will be held in Tripoli and the main theme there will be immigration
I have two points
First of all , a few months ago we were hearing about problems around the hosting of the agency in Poland: inadequate provision of accommodation and so on
Have those problems been resolved
FrontEx
This is Amendment 836 , to restore the sum as proposed by the Commission , i
e
, not to follow the Council cuts and to put even more resources in reserve
Will the Finnish Presidency support that increase in resources
President-in-Office of the Council
in the Member States
that respect it is still hard to give an absolutely precise answer to this question
Subject: Sharing information on convicted paedophiles
committed against children'
Member State , that information would be shared so that their name could be entered on other national sex offender registers and the ban enforced EU-wide
to Europe's citizens of the EU's valuable role in combating crime and increasing security
Has the Council abandoned its declared goal of prioritising the fight against the sexual exploitation of children
President-in-Office of the Council
the European Union of prohibitions arising from convictions for sexual offences committed against children of November 2004 is at present being debated by working groups in the Council
Most recently it was discussed by the criminal case cooperation team in October , just a week ago
content of the exchange of information extracted from criminal records between Member States
There are thus two other proposals for framework decisions on the table
The aim which these instruments have in common is to create structures to ensure that details on someone's criminal background are available generally and readily
crimes against children once again
The Council is therefore continuing to debate these proposals for framework decisions
It seems to me that the Council is going nowhere fast on these proposals
who exploit borders and profit from them
It seems to me that Member States are not getting their act together on this
measures to make sure that criminals are truly tracked , wherever they go
President-in-Office of the Council
(FI) Madam President , the protection of children , especially from the possibility of new assaults by those convicted of sex crimes , is obviously vitally important
occupation principle does not even exist in all the Member States
We therefore need to look for a way of dealing with the problem which can be applied in all the Member States of the Union
(PT) Madam President-in-Office of the Council , thank you very much for the information
My question is very precise and direct , so that we can judge your position
is an excellent tool in the fight against crime of this nature
President-in-Office of the Council
(FI) Madam President , this is an aim we all share: children can be protected from convicted individuals and there are different ways of doing that in the Member States
kinds of job and to use them to consider whether the person is suitable for the job
Such jobs , however , are very precisely defined
Members of Parliament
I should like to refer to a specific case as a means of illustrating that the sharing of information is not enough
of Ireland , in breach of the probation part of his sentence
prison
Is this case not a clear indication that full extradition arrangements are needed , otherwise justice will be evaded and full protection not afforded to the vulnerable
Can the President-in-Office accept that proper extradition is the optimum requirement
President-in-Office of the Council
(FI) Madam President , this Question Time slot is obviously not about what I can personally endorse , but what sort of discussions and decisions the Council should aspire to
and how we can otherwise make progress in the area of mutual recognition of convictions and judgments and the matter of extradition
Since its author is not present , Question No 4 lapses
Subject: Aviation sector
Can the European Council outline what new measures it intends to pursue to improve passenger safety on European airlines in light of the ongoing threat of international terrorism
President-in-Office of the Council
legal framework in the area of civil aviation security
The Regulation , which was made as a result of the September 11 terrorist attacks , has been in force since January 2003
To correct the problems which emerged in the implementation of this Regulation , the Commission put forward a proposal in September 2005 to replace the Regulation with a new one
In March of this year the Council adopted a general approach on the Commission proposal
In June the European Parliament adopted its position at first reading , which contained 85 amendments
On the basis of this , the Council achieved political consensus on the proposal on 12 October
reached at second reading
as possible
The impact of the new security measures recently introduced by the Commission and its committee for civil aviation security should , in addition , be monitored continually
Is the Council satisfied that there is enough cooperation between EU Member States in the fight against international terrorism
Do you agree that Europol and the EU Anti-Terror Office are being adequately funded
President-in-Office of the Council
(FI) Madam President , naturally we can always improve our efforts in the fight against terrorism
A lot of measures have of course been taken , especially in recent years , but there is always definitely room for improvement
(LT) Madam President-in-Office of the Council , most of us arrive here by air
I cannot remember even one case over recent years when aircraft were not delayed by a half-hour or an hour
Usually , the reason given is security issues
Could the reason be - and perhaps this really is the case - poorly organised and performed work
Will we still be able to verify whether security requirements are truly being applied after adoption of this document
President-in-Office of the Council
(FI) Madam President , as well as decision-making it is obviously very important that we monitor implementation and also continuously monitor changes in the operational environment
It is also vital , of course , that we are able to establish identical rules for different airports and different Member States
of inconvenience caused to passengers
I nevertheless think that we who travel very regularly also need to get used to the fact that air travel has become a more challenging occupation than before
to you that the Committee on Transport and Tourism has , with reference to this subject , also discussed the possibility of entrusting the EASA with security functions
I would be interested to know what the Presidency of the Council thinks about that idea
Now for my second question
than , for example , the police
Would it not make sense to reverse this privatisation and have security checks carried out once more by state agencies
President-in-Office of the Council
made more effective , but of course powers and competencies can only be transferred to it to the extent that the Member States say they are willing to endorse that
I find it very hard to believe that the speed of a security check should depend on whether we are dealing with a private player or a state institution
The question is more about targeting resources and how much there is in the way of resources generally
It is obvious that airports , especially at busy times , must have problems coping with large numbers of passengers
Subject: The status of the Irish language
The Irish language becomes an official working language of the EU institutions on 1 January 2007
in place so as to ensure that the Irish language becomes , in practice , an official working language of the European Union on 1 January next
President-in-Office of the Council
official and working languages of the European Union institutions
Union
This decision is therefore a departure from the rules
It will remain in force for five years and that period may be renewed
It was also decided that the derogation would not apply to the regulations made in the codecision procedure
of the decisions as from 1 January 2007 , when the Regulation comes into force
I thank the President-in-Office for her reply
Can I take it that , apart from the derogation mentioned , the Irish language will be given equal treatment with all other languages of this Parliament
President-in-Office of the Council
the derogation which I have just referred to
Parliament will itself also have the right to decide how it will in practice implement this
answer I did not want to describe in detail everything that will be taking place there , but everything that this decision requires
is , on the other hand , becoming costly and increasingly complex
What do the Council and the country holding the Presidency think about the future
Will this circle continue to expand or will some measures perhaps be applied to simplify language-related procedures
President-in-Office of the Council
(FI) Madam President , as the honourable Member says , linguistic diversity is central to European culture and the pluralism of European cultures
and there are sometimes just two , occasionally five or six , languages used
In fact the system has worked very well in practice
Subject: Tightening up of press censorship in China
The Chinese authorities have recently imposed tighter curbs on the foreign press , making it subject to strict internal rules
unity and sovereignty of the country
This is yet another instance of violation of human rights
The Commission has already voiced its concern and intends to raise the issue in future contacts with China
Will the Council be doing the same , and what measures does it propose to take against this totally unjustified press censorship
President-in-Office of the Council
(FI) Madam President , like the honourable Member , the Council is worried about tighter press censorship in China
Civil and Political Rights , which contains rules on freedom of expression
It has also encouraged China to lift travel restrictions on foreign journalists and made other demands that relate to interviewing Chinese citizens
This issue was raised at the round of talks on 19 October in Beijing as part of the EU-China human rights dialogue
in the sharpest terms and to threaten sanctions
When it happens in China , people simply express their concern
This has all the hallmarks of double standards
My question is specifically: will the violation of the freedom of press in China once again feature on the agenda at the next EU-China summit
Secondly , what specific measures will you be taking in order to actually demand that China's freedom of press and human rights in general be upheld
President-in-Office of the Council
(FI) Madam President , the Foreign Ministers of the country to hold the presidency and China met at the ASEM Summit in Helsinki on 10 September
At the time the matter of freedom of the press was in the limelight and the discussions between the Foreign Ministers devoted much time to this
We might therefore say that the European Union's reaction is just as swift as when it talks to other countries , and in a similar vein
At the start of September , there was a summit meeting held between the European Union and China and at this meeting the question of human rights was also discussed generally
Subject: EU Fundamental Rights Agency
this agency will have
President-in-Office of the Council
pursue its activities in areas referred to under the third pillar in the Treaty on European Union , which is to say cooperation on justice and home affairs
operations on 1 January 2007
still unanswered , namely extending the work of the Agency to areas covered by the third pillar in the Treaty on European Union
work of the Agency to areas covered by the third pillar in the Treaty on European Union , but in a more restricted format than in the Commission's original proposal
The majority of the delegations that presented their view supported this approach by the Presidency , although some wondered whether a proper legal basis for the move would be found
The Presidency is continuing to look at the options and will put forward an interim proposal to the delegations in the near future
law , and in this way help them guarantee a respect for fundamental rights when they implement measures or determine policy within the context of their competences
There is general consensus that establishing such an agency would create added value for EU policy on human rights and increase its coherence
The Agency will also be the main point of contact in the European Union for matters relating to fundamental rights
It will discharge its duties , complementing the work of the Council of Europe and in synergy with it , if the decisions on establishing it are taken
role in defending fundamental rights
Maybe you could enlighten us as to whether that is a true interpretation of what you have been outlining concerning the bilateral meetings
President-in-Office of the Council
(FI) Madam President , first it has to be said that it is intended that this Agency should be an advisory , expert body
to exercise the key competences necessary to do its job and undertake action under the third pillar
Accordingly , the work on this issue continues
action is most likely to cause problems with regard to human rights
has one , rather than when there is a real need - not so much this one , perhaps , but many of the others that have been created
All of them have a top-heavy structure with a management board with representation from every Member State and an administration that is sometimes smaller than the management board
President-in-Office of the Council
(FI) Madam President , perhaps there is an aim sometimes and in some contexts to do this
As the country to hold the presidency , however , we have tried to aim for an administrative structure that is as light as possible
With regard to the Fundamental Rights Agency , however , as I said at the start , there is positive consensus that it is necessary
in key areas of its operation
Subject: EU- Iranian relations
in Iran
President-in-Office of the Council
(FI) Madam President , the Council is committed to doing more to build long-term relations with Iran based on trust and cooperation
there , and Iran's nuclear programme
Iran's nuclear programme , but at the same time confirms Iran's right to the peaceful utilisation of nuclear power in accordance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
demands of the International Atomic Energy Agency's governing board and the UN Security Council and continued talks on long-term arrangements
the accuracy and scope of Iran's announcements regarding the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme
The EU is also very worried that Iran has not ended all its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities , as the IAEA's governing board and the UN Security Council have asked
The Security Council stated in its Resolution 1696 that it intended to implement relevant measures under Article 41 unless Iran complied with the demand
The Council accordingly is of the opinion that , if Iran continues its uranium enrichment activities , the Union will have no other alternative but to back talks on these sanctions
had been proposed for it
The EU's High Representative put forward to Iran on 6 June proposals drawn up by six countries
take account of international concerns
Opting for this positive approach would prepare the way for new relations with Iran , which could be based on mutual respect and extended cooperation in politics and economic matters
The Council hopes that progress can be made along this enlightened path
in this serious situation; but the idea of sanctions does not really work
It did not work in Iraq and it is not going to work in Iran
It is quite a wealthy , oil-rich country and they will just carry on
It may affect them somewhat , but it is not going to affect them that much in the long run
There are certain issues that you touched on yourself
about 3000 troops on the border trying to stop this going on
(The President cut off the speaker)
President-in-Office of the Council
(FI) Madam President , the discussion on possible sanctions obviously relates to the fact that the UN Security Council's Resolution 1696 is something the European Union is also committed to
Drugs trafficking is linked to the general situation in Afghanistan , which could even be the topic of a separate question
is kept in check there
Subject: EU facilitation for trade as a confidence-building measure between India and Pakistan
to offer technical assistance , if required , in this regard'
Similarly , Council Regulation (EEC) No 443/92 highlights regional cooperation as a 'priority area' for assistance and an important sector for economic cooperation
What role does the Council believe trade could play in bringing India and Pakistan closer to a peaceful resolution of the Kashmir question
Was this issue discussed at the recent EU-India Summit in Helsinki and what conclusions were reached
well as supporting closer economic integration in SAARC in general
President-in-Office of the Council
(FI) Madam President , the Council agrees that trade could have major significance in bringing India and Pakistan closer together
especially the agreement on establishing a free trade zone in South Asia by the year 2006
The EU is pleased with the recently signed South Asia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) , but understands that some Member States of SAARC still have unresolved bilateral issues
Resolving these would give the Member States of the Association the opportunity to derive full benefit from the agreements they are signatories to
the different countries
The decision by the SAARC ministerial council to confer on the EU the role of observer is a splendid opportunity to develop cooperation between SAARC and the EU
Cooperation between the two was discussed at the Seventh EU-India Summit in Helsinki on 13 October
The EU wants to improve the practical support it gives to SAARC
The Commission has already drafted a programme on economic cooperation with SAARC
The programme covers facilitation of trade , standards and cooperation between new businesses
the region
The SAARC Secretariat and the Member States of the EU intend to adopt this programme in the near future
The Union is encouraging broad dialogue between India and Pakistan and hopes that trading and other relations will develop favourably , because that would promote stability in the whole region
train connections and visits by members of parliament and sports teams have become possible
The Indian and Pakistani presidents met in Havana this September
Relations between the two countries were discussed at general level at a summit meeting held on 13 October
First of all I would like to thank the Council Presidency for the very detailed response to the question I tabled
I would , however , like one further specific piece of information
in Helsinki
The reason I ask that is because both those nations are having detailed discussions at Foreign Secretary level on 14 and 15 November
Is there a specific message to them from the Council
President-in-Office of the Council
(FI) Madam President , I was indeed present most of the time at this summit , but I do not remember how the Kashmir question arose
I have had it confirmed to me , however , that this question was touched upon as part of the issue of regional stability and the situation in the region
(LT) Madam President-in-Office , I have a question in relation to next week's visit of the delegation of the European Parliament to Kashmir by invitation of the Indian government
context
President-in-Office of the Council
between the two countries , it is essential that the parties themselves actively seek a solution
The Union and the other great powers can indeed support this process
States of America
Subject: Labour camps and violation of workers' rights
under conditions which failed to meet basic health and hygiene standards or comply with basic labour law in Italy
to respect labour law provisions)
EU territory in future
President-in-Office of the Council
(FI) Madam President , the honourable Member raises an important issue in this question
security at work
The Member States are responsible for implementing this code
camps referred to
the Commission , not the Council
(PL) Madam President , I have a question for the Presidency
authorities , and even local police , and the organisers of criminal activities , such as the labour camps for citizens of Central and Eastern Europe
President-in-Office of the Council
of other Member States with regard to working conditions
It is a question of monitoring it , which is the task of the Member States' own authorities
the regulations , and insist on it
- (LT) Mrs Lehtom√§ki , I would like to ask whether such camps in fact create a source of restriction for the free movement of persons
This is the situation the old Member States were in after the introduction of a transitional period for the new ones
By applying such a transitional period in Romania and Bulgaria , is it not encouraging illegal work
President-in-Office of the Council
(FI) Madam President , the Member States take decisions on whether to apply transition periods for new Member States regarding the free movement of the workforce
There were also Member States which applied a period of transition in the previous round of enlargement , but no longer do so in this new round
The reason is the perception that it is still better for a workforce to move within the framework of common European rules than create arrangements for derogations
attention to implementation and supervision
your mind back to Monday , when we determined the order in which business was to be conducted this week
The Conference of Presidents envisaged that Question Time would last one and a half hours; then the President reduced it to an hour
the hour and a half that we are rightly due
them from answering questions after seven in the evening
Questions to the Council used to begin after 9 p
m , and that worked like a dream , with the Council staying until the following day
To sum up , I think there is something wrong with this way of going about things
it was the agenda that was the subject of a vote
You can check that again in the Minutes
it is not dropped from the agenda too frequently
Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex)
That concludes Question Time
(The sitting was suspended at 7
05 p
m and resumed at 9
00 p
m
)
European families are protesting in increasing numbers against the discrimination to which they are subjected in connection with the provision of services and exercising their right to freedom of movement
Are there plans to harmonise the requirements in regard to the provision of services and guaranteeing freedom of movement within the EU to prevent the infringement of the rights
(FI) Madam President , in reply to the question the Council would first like to remind everyone that Article 18(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community states: 'every citizen

As the honourable Member certainly knows , the Commission , as the body that monitors the Treaty , must ensure that the provisions of the Treaty and the rules and regulations made
In July this year the Commission published a communication aiming at an EU strategy on children's rights with the purpose of promoting and protecting children's rights effectively in internal and

(FI) Madam President , we all have laws to prevent discrimination against all population groups and ages , such as the Racial Equality Directive and the Directive on discrimination in employment
As for the examples given of , for example , restaurant culture by the honourable Member , we do have to remember that citizens of the Member States , in addition to the Council ,
have , as consumers and , when it comes down to it , those who are paying for these services , also have considerable powers of influence on what sort of culture should evolve
(DE) Madam President , I just wanted to draw your attention to the fact that this is a problem not only in Greece , but also in Austria , where it is positively
(FI) Madam President , there has of course been much discussion in the area of advertising relating to children , especially with regard to marketing and what sort of marketing and
As concerns the example given by the honourable Member asking the additional question with regard to hotels , I would say again what I said in my previous answer , that
(FI) Madam President , it is Council Regulation of 26 October 2004 establishing a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States
Under the Regulation , the Council is given information concerning the Agency's action programme , the general and special risk analyses that it prepares , an annual general report and the Agency's
Regarding this , I would refer you to the relevant Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a mechanism for the creation of Rapid
The European Council proposed last December that the Member States , the Council and the Commission should take certain measures before the end of the year to improve practical cooperation among
In recent months the Council , for example in its session on 24 July and at the informal ministerial meeting in September , has been paying particular attention to improving operative cooperation
In its conclusions it urged Frontex to promote a feasibility study on the establishment of a European Surveillance System which , in its initial phase , would cover the whole of
The Council also asked Frontex to consider setting up regional centres with links to one another , which would be at Frontex's disposal in operational matters in different maritime areas
According to Article 33 of Council Regulation establishing a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union and
The Presidency has referred to that , but the specific question I would like to ask is whether you believe that it will be possible to continue the Frontex operation
in the Atlantic after 1 January , and whether the Council believes it is worth spending money on resources , on maintaining this Agency , which , I would repeat , has worked , is still
While we admit that it has also had some problems , or at least challenges , we have to remember that the Agency is still very young and , at the same
Is the Council also considering doing something to relieve the burden , for example mounting information campaigns in the countries of origin , in order to make potential migrants aware of
(FI) Madam President , one very crucial question , which relates generally to illegal immigration or immigration as a whole , is obviously the extent to which we cooperate with countries of
Recently in the Union the aim has been to focus special attention on points of contact between immigration itself and development , working on the notion that we should be
Secondly , will the Finnish Presidency pledge to support and to persuade other Member States to accept the amendments that the European Parliament is about to vote to the budget of
(FI) Madam President , Frontex's ability to deal with these illegal immigration situations , and that of the Union generally , naturally depends very much on what level of commitment there is
This has been discussed recently in detail at various Union levels , most recently at the EU Lahti Summit last Friday , but this debate is still going on , so in
What is the state of play in the Council regarding the proposed 'Framework Decision on the recognition and enforcement in the EU of prohibitions arising from convictions for sexual offences
It would mean that if a paedophile or child molester was disqualified from working with children after conviction for a sex attack or involvement in child pornography in one
Why has the Council apparently been unable so far to agree on this important proposal which the European Parliament backed in June 2006 and which would give a practical example
(FI) Madam President , the initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium with a view to the adoption by the Council of a Framework Decision on the recognition and enforcement in
An examination of the initiative also forms part of the discussions which the Council working groups are holding on other proposals , such as that for a Framework Decision on
taking account of convictions in the Member States of the European Union in the course of new criminal proceedings and that for a Council Framework Decision on the organisation and
When all the Member States have eventually implemented these acts in their national legislation , it should be easier to prevent a convicted individual from working with children or committing
Nearly two years ago we had an ambitious programme from the Commission in response to strong public interest in ensuring that criminals , like sex offenders , are not the ones
I do not understand how we can tell our public that the EU is effective in combating crime if the Council is so slow in deciding on these top-priority
There are , however , many very practical problems , as well as problems relating to principles , attached to these proposals for framework decisions , for example , the fact that this ban on
Does the Council , that is to say , the Finnish Presidency , not believe that citizens having access to personal data on those convicted of paedophilia or sexual violence against young people
For example , in my country there is a system in place where an employer has the right to obtain the criminal records of those seeking or applying for certain
There are different ways of doing this in the Member States , and that is one reason why progress in this matter has been slow in the opinion of many
Paul Hunter Redpath is a convicted paedophile who served the custodial part of his sentence in my constituency of Northern Ireland and then recently took refuge in the Republic
He can now live there freely , and is unable to be arrested , whereas in Northern Ireland the penalty for breaching his probation order would be an immediate return to
The Council , however , now intends to proceed in accordance with the assimilation principle , which means that a Member State would be obliged to attach to convictions in a foreign
court legal effects that are equivalent to those which they attach to national convictions , although this is ultimately very much to do with wider cooperation on justice and home affairs
(FI) Madam President , Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security represents the Community's current
The adopted text is to be formally reinforced as a common position in a future Council session and submitted to the European Parliament , so that consensus can be swiftly
In consideration of the security problems experienced by the United Kingdom in August this year , the Council hopes that the institutions will reach consensus on the new Regulation as quickly
Obviously , good predictability will definitely enable us in everyday practical circumstances to tell beforehand how much time security checks , for example , will take up and thereby reduce the amount
(DE) Madam President-in-Office of the Council , I would like - in my capacity as rapporteur on the extension of the powers of the European Air Safety Agency - to report
Something that has struck me personally is that the privatisation of security checks at airports has had the consequence that these are less able to deal with extreme situations
(FI) Madam President , obviously it is good for the Council to look at and discuss , for example , how the work of the European Aviation Safety Agency needs to be
Can the European Council make a comprehensive statement as to the preparations that have been put in place to guarantee that the EU institutions will have all the necessary systems
(FI) Madam President , at the request of the Irish Government , the Council altered the rules on language in June 2005 and added the Irish language to the list of

In accordance with the European Council conclusions , the Finnish Presidency held a number of bilateral meetings in July , August , September and October with the aim of resolving the main question
At a Council session in early October the Presidency presented a review of the talks that had been held and asked for support for the idea of extending the
As regards the Agency's competence , the aim of the Agency is to provide advice and expertise on fundamental rights to Community institutions , bodies and agencies when they are applying Community
The points you have raised reflect the concern that many of us in Parliament have that , once we propose this agency , the initial role we had envisaged for it will
be diluted until it ends up as a think-tank or a contact point that would merely be distributing information from one Member State to another , rather than taking a leading
We also of course believe , however , that it would be difficult to justify to our citizens the establishment of a Fundamental Rights Agency which would be denied the right
It seems to me that the Member States are muddling their way through to creating an agency that will not have within its responsibilities the very subject area where EU
I have a further question: does the Council not agree that we seem to be creating more and more agencies , like confetti sprinkled around the Member States , so that everybody
Accordingly , we have to work hard to ensure that the decisions are taken , that the Agency can start to function as from 1 January , and that it has competence
Can the European Council make a statement on the present state of play with regard to EU-Iranian relations , addressing in particular the issue of the future of the nuclear industry
Improved relations will mean progress in all the problematic issues , among which are human rights , terrorism , Iran's attitude to the peace process in the Middle East and local matters
In the matter of Iran's nuclear industry , the Council has many a time said it was committed to a diplomatic solution , which would take account of the international concern about
Regarding this , the Council stated on 17 October that it greatly valued the perseverance with which High Representative Javier Solana has since June encouraged Iran to respond to the
The EU views seriously the IAEA's evaluation that it has not been able to make any progress in almost four years of continued close monitoring in its efforts to confirm
The Council this month stated that the door to the negotiating chamber was still open for Iran , and urged the country strongly to opt for the positive approach that
These far-reaching proposals would form a basis for a long-term agreement and would give Iran everything it needs to develop its current civil nuclear energy sector , and they also
I can see that you are trying to have confidence-building measures between Europe and Iran , to try to better relations between the two of them and act as honest broker
One of these is the shipment of heroin out of Afghanistan through Iran , and considering that there are about three million heroin addicts in Iran and they have lost
The Union is committed long-term to the diverse development of Afghanistan , as well as the peacekeeping operation and crisis management in that country , so that the production of drugs

This goes back to my original question as to whether the particular issue in relation to Pakistan/India and Kashmir was actually specifically discussed at the EU Summit with India
What do you think the major states , primarily the United States and Russia , contribute to solving the problem of Kashmir and what else could the European Union do in this
(FI) Madam President , regarding this question , as with many others that have been raised in this Chamber today , it has to be said that , as it concerns an issue
As , however , I am answering questions here mainly on behalf of the Council , it is impossible for me to take a very strong view on behalf of the United
In July 2006 the Italian police , in cooperation with Polish law enforcement authorities , closed down labour camps in southern Italy in which Polish workers were being kept by Italian employers
Further investigations have revealed that this was not an isolated example and that workers in other regions of Italy and other EU Member States have encountered similar practices (failure
Will the Council take action to punish those responsible for this breach of workers' rights and will it take effective measures to prevent the establishment of such labour camps within

The Council welcomes the fact that in the case referred to in the honourable Member's question , the Italian and Polish law enforcement agencies cooperated to close down the work

(FI) Madam President , the Community code that exists for this sector and the secondary legislation that has been added to it demands a guarantee of equal treatment of nationals
In accordance with the principles of the rule of law and good governance , in the Union we have to expect these supervisory bodies also to act in accordance with
As I said in my answer to a previous question , equal treatment of the workforce is very well regulated , but of course we have to pay more and more
(DE) Madam President , my criticism is not directed at you , for I hold the way you run Question Time in high regard , but I really would like you to cast
Several Members protested at this , and there was no vote on it , and so I have worked on the assumption that we have available to us for Question Time

Local development and employment initiatives
European Parliament on a European strategy for encouraging local development and employment initiatives (COM(95)0273 - C40289/95)
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in the European Union there are still more than eighteen million people registered as unemployed
The real number of people seeking work is undoubtedly considerably higher than that
All the experts agree that there is no magic formula for combatting unemployment , but that there are a number of possibilities
particular in the services sector
This was to be done by opening up to the employment market needs that had so far not been met
One year later , in 1994 , at the Essen Summit , the Council asked the Commission to prepare appropriate measures
reducing unemployment
technologies
The positive experience gained so far in various sectors and various EU Member States enables us to hope that local jobs can be successfully created
My work as rapporteur was concerned chiefly with the following points
the supply side , and possibly to expand them
and commerce
There should be occupational reintegration systems which allow for a combination of paid work and unemployment benefit
by information and communication technologies
In addition , public service concessions and delegated management deserve wider application
in human resources; better formulation of European Union structural policies , for example through the simplification and rationalization of programmes
Member States
the financing of local employment initiatives
The structural funds and the existing support options seem in my opinion to be adequate
On this point I agree with the Commission , and I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the Commission most warmly for its valuable cooperation
for which I should like to express my grateful thanks - will meet with your acceptance
will benefit from the services provided
of the principle of subsidiarity , something which I , as a local politician of long standing , wholeheartedly support
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Economic Affairs Committee is unanimous that this Commission report is an extremely interesting document
provide the solution
Above all , the Economic Affairs Committee is aware of the obstacles which hamper the development of new services
Firstly , government policies on employment are still too passive
Secondly , there is not enough worker training and education
Thirdly , some Member States have no legislative and regulatory framework for initiatives and organizations created under partnerships between the public and private sectors
Major obstacles are also found in the financial domain
Certain services are too expensive because of heavy social costs
Making some services tax-deductible would take them out of the black economy
A survey by a Belgian university shows that 300 000 Flemish households employ domestic help
This equates to approximately 70 000 full-time jobs which could be created officially
The Commission has calculated that an employment policy geared to satisfying new requirements could create between 150 000 and 400 000 jobs a year in the Union
Such a policy is , furthermore , five times as efficient as increasing employment in government departments and ten times as efficient as creating jobs through government investment
It is a pity that this debate has been divorced from the other debates on jobs
Even the Commission President says nothing about it in his pact for jobs
Despite the fact that President Delors , in his White Paper , described the meeting of new requirements as one of the best ways of creating jobs
unemployment in the Union
Further encouragement of these initiatives is needed and we urge the Commission to continue playing a role here as catalyst and driving force
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in this document , local development and employment initiatives have finally achieved Europe-wide recognition of their importance as an essential instrument in combatting unemployment
document and enlarged upon in Parliament's report , then the unemployment rate could be halved by the year 2000
projects
We are now asking Member States to delay no longer in implementing this strategy , and to include capital for local employment and development initiatives in all their multiannual employment programmes
high level of qualification , and forced to work in badly paid sectors
and also , it goes without saying , people should be able to operate independently and responsibly
The 10 % that has so far been spent on local employment initiatives is nowhere near enough
We are asking for a significant increase
I would be looking for a figure of 25-30 %
However , it must be emphasized that the whole problem of mass unemployment cannot be solved by local employment and development initiatives alone , even though they are an important factor
fact that it is important that even now , within the current structural-funds period , a move towards more employment should be made possible , by means of precisely such innovative projects
We are asking the Member States to rapidly demolish the obstacles that they have so far set up in the way of such local employment initiatives
There are legal and administrative obstacles , and above all there is the sectorallyoriented thinking on the part of the administrative authorities
that this type of policy , which has had the effect of concentrating and polarizing economic power within central authorities , as a result of the trans-European networks , will finally be reconsidered
Madam President , I should like to begin by congratulating and thanking the rapporteur for the report that we are now debating
deal of discussion and many amendments in the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment , on behalf of which I speak
chiefly , an exercise on paper but which is based , essentially , on an inventory of endeavours embarked on in every corner of Europe
Yes , unemployment certainly is the biggest threat to the social cohesion and development of Europe , and combating it , therefore , is - must be - the top social and political priority
needs of the citizen
approach , the encouragement , that is , of local employment and development initiatives , makes it possible to pursue these two major objectives in combination
The 17 closely analyzed fields are not mutually exclusive , of course
will emerge
They are obviously directed in the main at working people who are under-privileged and their real value will show in areas of deprivation
unemployment problem
common conception throughout the European Union
There are opportunities already in place: ongoing programmes such as LEADER and URBAN
There is Article 10 of the Regional Fund
And there are new possibilities as well - I go to the other end of things - such as the carbon dioxide tax
presidency , which has declared its interest , and in particular to the conference to be held on the matter in November
Madam President , culture creates jobs
That is a fact which , despite being pointed out by many professionals in the sector , has only recently been given recognition in the Commission's official documents
cultural impact of the Community's policies
culture takes pride of place
young and elderly people
These are areas which are appropriate for women's jobs , and also are areas where women can find innovative solutions
which is now beginning to bear fruit
Why do I attribute such importance to culture as a job creator
It is because the 'employment' priority only makes sense if we link together two fundamental concepts of the European Union: citizenship and social cohesion
Cultural employment improves living standards , increases people's self-esteem , creates the conditions in which we can finally attain the ultimate objective of the European Union: the well-being of its citizens
public sectors which we did so much to rid ourselves of
We must avoid the perverse effects which job creation can bring with it
That is why we must involve local authorities and encourage , as far as possible , partnerships between the public and private sectors and between authorities and companies
Support under ERDDF for innovative action and inter-regional activity in the social and cultural areas , under Article 10 , is one example which must be strengthened and broadened
This Commission programme might be the manna we were waiting for and help us to create employment and consolidate popular participation
Let us hope we can recognize its importance and use it intelligently
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , unemployment is still a crucial problem in the European Union
The unemployment level - the rapporteur , Mr Schiedermeier , has referred to it - is currently running at 10
8 %
There is therefore an urgent need for action
up to 400 , 000 new jobs a year can be created
places in which people can live and work
The Group of the European People's Party supports the Commission's proposal
In the document , seventeen areas are defined in which new jobs could be created
I should just like to mention a few of those areas that appear to me to be of particular interest
Stronger support must be given to shops in rural areas
needs the family car to get to work , because there are no longer any shops in the vicinity
Structures in rural areas must be expanded and consolidated
Only in this way is it possible to offer young people an incentive to stay in the region
This includes expanding public transport facilities and also extending the road network
In addition , I welcome the fact that domestic work is to be given recognition
A job in a household is worth just as much as a job in industry
Therefore adjustments need to be made in areas such as taxation and insurance law
These jobs must be brought out of the grey area
The Commission is planning to introduce service vouchers , along French lines , as a local method of payment
By means of these vouchers , private individuals can obtain services on an hourly or a daily basis
One private household rarely provides a full-time job
Women work in several households and in none of them are they subject to national insurance , so they are unable to obtain pensions insurance and social security
Service vouchers would make it possible for several workplaces to be combined together to make one job that would be subject to national insurance
The constant challenges and changes in the economic position of a business mean that employees are often forced to look around for other opportunities
Nowadays , hardly any employee will spend his or her whole life working in the same career , for the same employer
Only by means of a broad-based basic education system is a change of career possible
Therefore we must make sure that those who are educated in future are provided with a broad spectrum of basic knowledge
The world of work today has many different aspects
Job sharing , multiple skilling and the combination of self-employed activities with activities that are subject to compulsory insurance
In other words , it is a question of making adjustments to the legal conditions in this area too
We must do everything in our power to combat unemployment in Europe
increase further in the future
These measures should include , in particular , local development and employment initiatives which the Commission hopes to encourage and to which the Schiedermeier report has made a special contribution
ones , to mushroom in all the Member States and their regions , with subsequent results in terms of job creation
which fleshed it out and improved it
major contribution to the necessary search for local job creation potential
employment initiatives , or else by lending financial support for the creation of small companies on a local level , for their material needs , infrastructure and developing and training the management
development of local initiatives or make them more difficult
unemployment
or the ultimate objectives , make the report less satisfactory and more controversial
Community level alone , otherwise we might only worsen the situation of the European economy , especially its industry , which is already so uncompetitive
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , we have here an interesting communication from the Commission
The Social Affairs Committee responded creatively to it and Mr Schiedermeier worked hard to produce a good report on it
I think this report deserves to be acted on
But I fear it will hit a bottleneck
What we need to get this report acted on is cooperation from the Member States and cooperation from the regions
there is scant enthusiasm for cooperating on European policies over matters which are to some degree perceived as areas for subsidiarity
So it will take a lot of persuasion to get the national Member States on board , financially as well
Looking at the budget we find that Member States are busy cutting back on the very budget lines which might be used to fund this
So I would ask the Commissioner to make an extra effort here
There are a few more points close to my heart
I , together with my Group , am not so hostile to a Europe-wide carbon tax
I think if one introduces that kind of fiscal measure one must do so for the whole of Europe and then one has a certain level of financing available
For the rest I would draw your attention to the role of insurance companies
In my country insurance companies sometimes conclude contracts with companies providing services which then form part of the terms of insurance
I think these are also points which we might encourage , for example in pilot projects
part of existing companies
I would urge the Commission to give real additional opportunities here both to profit-making and non-profit-making bodies , but in any event to the private sector
Lastly , Madam President , I think we should also take an in-depth look at the Commission's agricultural policy
the preservation of areas of natural beauty
That can in principle be done , but we shall need to deal creatively with the funds which Europe itself already has
Madam President , the gradual elimination of the mass unemployment which exists in the EU Member States calls for a great many different measures
The report rightly stresses that the basis for local employment initiatives - partnership , participation and autonomous planning - is very important in combatting unemployment , and it should be strengthened
It is important to promote innovative ideas such as , precisely , employment agreements among the various parties at local level
they face are similar
Last year an employment project began in Tampere one element in which was an agreement of intent to preserve employment
The parties to the agreement are the town authorities , the employment exchange and the labour district
The short-term aim is that the agreement should be endorsed by entrepreneurs , organizations representing them , voluntary organizations and the unemployed
Special attention has been devoted to the long-term unemployed and the young
The means of preventing exclusion is to offer permanent or temporary work , vocational training and/or apprenticeships , traineeships and specialized training as an employment measure
Despite its high unemployment rate - 23
6 % - Tampere belongs to the European Union's so-called white area
The EU has imposed significant limits on economic aid to the projects I have just described
The vertical organization of society and the sectorization of public administration have also impeded the development of local employment initiatives
Partnership particularly requires horizontal cooperation , cutting across administrative fields
Like the report , I consider it important to develop Member States' judicial and administrative practices in such a way that they support partnership at local level
The Commission's new measures to support local employment initiatives are welcome , and I hope that all towns will receive assistance from them soon
course I am thinking mainly of Germany here - have tried to block the Commission's initiative in this sphere in the name of subsidiarity
present subject , was made in this House during the earlier legislative period , by Aline Archambaud
I should just like to make a few necessary comments on the subjects covered by this report
qualifications etc
redistribution of paid and unpaid work , and not the creation of a new servant class of housemaids and car-park attendants
contribution
have to be created in this sector , meaningful , future-oriented jobs , which really will enrich society
In this sense , the implementation of the Commission's initiative is an urgent demand , which we must make together
about compiling his report
undervalued part of a European strategy on jobs
large-scale infrastructure policy which we seek to defend
far
It is obvious that if we want to give this sector the chance to develop , we must provide not only a European framework of support but also European financial incentives
That much is clear from a whole raft of initiatives and experiences from the various Member States
receiving unemployment benefit and which uses a system of vouchers
The system has clear merits but at the same time a number of risks in the formula have also surfaced
levels of pay
Secondly , it would be a real shame to limit this promising sector to odd jobs , to casual jobs
or partially profitable and which may benefit very much from the demand and high purchasing power which still exists in society
I hope , Commissioner , that we shall get more than just a communication
We need a European programme of action , a coherent programme , a global programme which is equipped with European instruments
You are very well aware that the European Union can play a part here
It has already done so in experiments financed through the European Social Fund and above all URBAN
or other structural funds but that we should on the contrary think in terms of increasing these funds for the purpose of these initiatives too
I will say just this: we have to do more
public transport network
trans-European networks alone
And I agree with Mrs Boogerd-Quaak that the carbon tax might go a very long way towards developing this sector
In conclusion , Madam President , I congratulate the Commission on its initiatives but I hope it will now think creatively and come up with a concrete programme of action
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , how many people are unemployed in Europe
Eighteen million
Twenty million
The battle over statistics will not create a single new job
All this moaning about structural weaknesses and past mistakes , that is nothing more than a lament now
but it will not fill people's stomachs
It is clear that we need to take practical action , and achieve changes at local level
Local employment initiatives make it possible to improve living and working conditions
Local work for local people using local resources means , in the first place , services
from health protection to child care; and finally the leisure sector , from tourism to cultural initiatives
The potential which can be achieved at local level , but which is all too seldom used , or is even transferred elsewhere , must be exploited to the full
This spatial proximity makes it possible to have a precise knowledge of special circumstances , supplies and needs
We can see who the target groups are , from women to young people with problems to the elderly , those who are difficult to employ , and other disadvantaged workers
We can also see what the framework conditions are
Private job providers and public agencies should stop blocking each other's initiatives all the time
They should cooperate , and agree to have the courage be creative and develop in new directions
Let us not deceive ourselves: the obstacles are still enormous
of government bodies , public resources to finance orders and start-up capital , and qualifications for those who might be involved in these initiatives
We need a coherent framework for action , plus financial incentives for development , the removal of administrative and legal obstructions , and target-specific consultation
local development initiatives
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the report we are now debating on a European strategy for local development and employment initiatives calls for our full agreement
I would actually say it is stimulating for anyone who deals with local and regional development in our countries
among the wide range of solutions which can be adopted for this very serious problem , unemployment
new needs and thereby help to slash unemployment in Europe
local development and supporting local companies in as many different ways as possible
full the role of dynamic force in encouraging any credible and effective solutions that might help to tackle the social scourge of unemployment
in social , cultural and environmental fields
I am very interested in the environmental areas , since I am a member of the Committee on the Environment
There are very worthwhile possibilities in water and waste management and protection of natural habitats
The rapporteurs note , however , that there are legal and tax obstacles as well as obstacles relating to educational background; most workers come from industrial restructuring in Europe
We believe we also have to consider better management of resources , and locate jobs in old trades and in craft industries
But I should like to place some emphasis on the opinion expressed by Mrs Marinucci as representative of the Committee on Women's Rights
Mrs Marinucci highlights the contradiction between competitiveness and job creation
Europe cannot compete with the very low wages and abysmal working conditions of the Third World
And this contradiction is unresolved
I should also like to signal the continuous creation of insecure jobs
I live in a country where 34 % of jobs are insecure , a situation mainly endured by women
It is not enough just to create jobs
We need to create jobs with some degree of security
And we are worried that the public sector may cease to finance most welfare benefits
We are therefore concerned over the replacement of public by private action , since there are poor and scattered populations in which private enterprise would find no profit
To conclude , I believe the obstacles and contradictions have to be overcome so that local job initiatives can go forward , since they are of real importance
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the creation of jobs is becoming one of the most important tasks for the immediate future
Mr Schiedermeier's comprehensive report makes this absolutely clear , and I am able to agree with his ideas in many areas
preceded by the creation of value-creating jobs
In order to do this , innovative people and businesses must be motivated and supported by framework conditions which will trigger a business-creation offensive
will be unable to develop further because of a lack of tourists with money to spend
the idea of how the value-creation chain operates , and they are just frittering away the subsidy funds
Therefore I should like to point out that regional and local employment initiatives must be encouraged before anything else
international level too , businesses whose activities are not continually thwarted by overregulation
the redistribution of capital , but rather understand that success and competitiveness can be improved if they reinforce regional strengths and encourage local creativity
Only if these conditions are met will we be in a position to create jobs in the long term
Madam President , housing cooperatives , women's employment projects , new media and cultural industries , environmental regeneration projects are known to many of us in our local area
hope of work to people not getting a fair deal within the labour market
fair to those in work
There has been a lot of talk in this debate about the legal and administrative obstacles to local employment in the Member States
But what does Europe itself do for those at local level who seek its support
Only a small fraction of the structural demands are aimed at innovatory projects
There is a periodic newsletter and a methodology for the Member States to use if they wish
last in line
takes to come to terms with the rules that Europe lays down for access to its support
endeavour
I do not want to see this limited to a few demonstration projects
I want local economic development to be first in line when European programmes are planned , managed and implemented
closer to becoming a reality
Madam President , the debate on this report has been encouraging
Given that we are fighting massive unemployment in my country , we study with interest all ideas which can improve employment
We all know that economic growth is necessary but not sufficient
All the special measures are therefore needed
Our country does not have a long tradition of small enterprise and private service provision
Many of the welfare and non-profit-making services mentioned in the report are provided at local-government level in Finland
Their impact on employment is very considerable , and their development accords with the ideas mentioned in the report
Privatization does not create new jobs: on the contrary
It is true that private services are needed as a supplement to public ones
and ideas as to how we could improve the employment situation
tripartite model
Government could be represented by local government; the second party could comprise entrepreneurs , employers and enterprises , while the third would comprise the trade unions
They could tackle this serious employment problem with local resources
Part of unemployment benefit should be used for this purpose
More could be achieved than at present using these resources
The trade unions would certainly be interested in the idea and would set to work on behalf of the unemployed
We could find ways of working close to the unemployed
If the Union also actively supported such measures , this would provide an effective and practical model which would emanate from the Union and operate at local level
Madam President , I would like to repeat what I said in my report
cultural study
public services , which are on the other hand the characteristic European model we are constantly claiming that we want to defend
are shared among a number of channels , would not even be sufficient to create genuine additional work
not even enough replacement work
is , to be given greater organic unity by the Commission , badly ignores the 'question of women'
Fund and in URBAN II: programmes have been drawn up , but they are not actually being implemented
On the contrary , one programme - called ILO and including local employment for women - has unfortunately been cancelled
women who normally provide them because they possess skills which they can then make available to society
For these reasons I believe that we should think carefully and consider the desirability of going further in this direction or of improving the Commission's position
who contributed in the process
the House for our proposed European strategy to encourage local development and employment initiatives
I am very taken by the standard of the contributions here this morning on this matter
As you know , following from the Commission's White Paper on Growth , Competitiveness and Employment of 1993 the Essen Summit defined an action programme and a structured approach to fight unemployment
This strategy has now been refined during successive European Summits from Cannes to Florence last June
morning: we need such an integrated framework approach
From our point of view , these local initiatives are , of course , of major importance for several reasons
They provide new job opportunities for people , including the long-term unemployed , young people and unemployed women
I would like to assure Mrs Marinucci that women , in so far as these local employment initiatives are concerned , are of paramount importance to us all
jobs leading to a possible 400 , 000 new jobs annually in Europe
is a very important feature
of life in the cultural and leisure sectors , as well as in the environment sector
areas and the need to take action in all of them at this time
what we call the promoters of the social economy
However , this important new job-creation potential does face some difficulties
There are obstacles which need to be dealt with and they were referred to generally throughout the debate this morning
I would like to list some of those obstacles
Firstly , the financial obstacles
the unattractive level of return for certain types of services
lack of training in new technologies
technologies that are going to dominate all our lives in the future
Thirdly , legal and regulatory obstacles
These stem from the absence of proper legal status for partnership between private and public organisations and the absence of quality standards in the service sector
Finally , institutional obstacles
of initiatives
I support Mr Howitt's point of view in this matter and he carefully stated it here this morning
Ladies and gentlemen , you know that jobs cannot be wished into existence
They are the result of investment and they are the result of investment by very many people
We believe that public authorities and administrations have an important role to play in establishing a framework favourable to the creation of new jobs
initiatives
On the one hand , national and regional policies must concentrate on removing structural obstacles , whether financial , technical , legal or administrative
good practice and encouragement for the exchange of experience , notably through cooperation and support of transnational networks
Not enough is known of things that are succeeding and things that are being done well in many Member States
We have to pinpoint what is good , isolate it , tell others about it and encourage people to adapt it to their own circumstances
There is support being given to national measures which benefit local initiatives , particularly via the structural funds
A lot of comment was made this morning about better use being made of our existing financial resources and I support that point of view strongly
The strategy for encouraging local development and employment initiatives was conceived as part of the larger framework designed by the Essen European Council to fight unemployment
Some Member States had begun to translate this support for local initiatives into concrete measures in the context of their multi-annual employment programmes
initiatives and what they propose doing over the next couple of years
Even though much remains to be done , I am convinced that this strategy for encouraging local development initiatives is a promising way to fight unemployment
For far too long it remained in the shade , that is true
voluntary and smaller groups in our Member States
initiatives
The Commission is aware that more has to be done
You have called for this to be taken on board and that it must be done better and quicker than in the past
It is for that reason , following our action for employment in Europe , our confidence pact , that the Commission presented its communication on Community structural assistance and employment
The aim of this communication is to provide markers for the negotiations currently under way in the use of Community structural funds
It has a special place in the promotion and the development of local initiatives
In keeping with the Commission's proposal concerning territorial and local pacts for employment , the Florence European Council also stressed the importance of local employment and development initiatives
House today for what we seek to do in encouraging local development
has highlighted the need for innovation
and long-lasting and effective in so far as job creation is concerned , and I thank the House for their support this morning
The debate is closed
The vote will take place today at 11 a

Extension of common transit system
of the common transit system
Mr President , this is an unusual oral question insofar as the majority of the Members of the House are actually interested in the answer
So I will assume that the oral question is asked
I will listen with great eagerness to the answer as will other members of the committee of inquiry into transit fraud
In the light of Commissioner Monti's answer and with your permission Mr President , perhaps we can ask further questions so that we can do justice to the answer itself
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Tomlinson's question gives me the opportunity to provide clarifications on some important points , and is therefore welcome
18 million documents were issued to cover transit operations in the Community
The simplification of the formalities , combined with considerable flexibility in the use of the procedures , explains the success of these systems in business circles
They constitute a factor of primary importance which assists trade between the Community and third countries
the Polish Republic and the Slovak Republic became contracting parties to the EC/EFTA Convention of 20 May 1987 on a common transit system
countries

in order to ensure that the customs administrations and operators were fully briefed about these systems and trained and prepared for their use

been duly established that the candidate countries have reached a level of preparation which will enable them to ensure correct application of the transit procedures
In view of past experience , a preparatory period of several years is to be expected
Consideration also needs to be given to another important aspect: the plans for reforming the transit system
in which a great deal of attention is being given to the work of the European Parliament's temporary committee of inquiry under the chairmanship of Mr Tomlinson
against fraud , especially through the computerization which should be completed in 1998

in Interlaken
I have four specific questions to Commissioner Monti concerning that
At what political level was the Commission represented on this committee
Did the Commission seek explicit prior consent of Parliament and Council to the extension before it was finally agreed
Was the decision the subject of unanimous agreement in the Joint Committee
And was the Joint Committee itself bound by the terms of the Europe Agreements between the EU and the Visegrad countries and did they specify a timetable for extension
before accession
Would the Commission agree that the economic and financial risks associated with accession were subordinated to the political commitment to extend the system itself
wait longer than the Visegrad states before acceding to the common transit system
If so , with what justification
My final question is to ask the Commission to give us an undertaking
It presumes that the reform of the transit system will be completed before the next extension of the common transit system
Will the Commission therefore commit itself to subordinate further extension of the system to the completion of the reforms that Commissioner Monti referred to
Finally , I criticized the Commission publicly yesterday in committee for not having sent us some information they promised
like to say today that I accept that without reservation
Unfortunately , however , just as we have problems in the common transit procedure , we clearly have common transit problems between the Breydel and the Berlaymont that we must sort out
Mr President , the questions that Mr Tomlinson has raised on behalf of the committee are questions that I had hoped the Commission would have dealt with in its reply
Of course , they are also questions that are not being raised for the first time here today
precision , and yet we have never received an answer to them
have been necessary
Of course we do actually receive replies , Commissioner Monti - please don't misunderstand me
that we are really no longer able to communicate at all , because obviously such difficulties in communication do not occur only in the postal services
whether it was right to accept their applications , but whether it was right to do so at that particular moment
European Union should gradually , bit by bit , be introduced to this system and integrated into it
process , even when the situation in the candidate countries had been reviewed
That is the key question that lies behind all this
It is not a matter of the principal question: ' Should we or shouldn't we
'
out a sort of dunning letter , saying 'The Common Transit System is collapsing
Do something
' , while another part of the Commission is actually extending this collapsing system
Then , of course , we are told that reform and extension are not mutually exclusive , that somehow we shall manage to do everything at the same time
But one phase of the extension scheme has now been completed , and - as you have just explained to us - we are in for the next phase
particular moment - and I emphasize at this particular moment - was the wrong one
Mr President , I make no apology to Mr Monti that this oral question is in fact a continuing series of questions because many questions still remain to be answered
First , who made the commitment to the Visegrad states that they would be brought into the system
Was it the Council acting as the Council or was it intergovernmental
Was it at a lower level , at COREPER
Was it the Commission or was it an administrative decision
at that level
the present systems are in crisis
We look back to the Court of Auditors report of 1988
That alerted us
There was a stronger report from the Court of Auditors for the year 1994
Then there were two papers which the Commission itself produced to justify the expenditure for computerization to try to overcome this crisis in the system
of the system was a mistake
So why was it extended
It is possible that the first decision was made before any of these notices were given that the system was in chaos
So we would like to know on what date that decision was taken
officials
That causes concern
How was it put into operation
We understand that the training given by PHARE was good
The investment was high
But there were not sufficient trained officials on the ground by 1 July to enable them to come into the system
We have been told - I think somewhat cynically - that one or two Member States have a lower level of readiness than the four Visegrad countries themselves
But , as I say , that is a cynical comment
What happened is that the Community created new trade frontiers well beyond the present EU boundaries
It allows these four countries to have a veto on any changes to the system
This seems odd because they do not have Members in this House
They are not represented on the Council or the Commission so how is it that they can be involved and possibly veto any changes
For the present , what steps is the Commission taking to monitor the extension which has been granted since 1 July
been a growth in the fraud committed in the transit system
The Commissioner has been kind enough to say that plans for amendment to the transit system are under way
not have a confrontation about the amendments which are being brought forward
Mr President , it would be difficult for me to outdo the three colleagues who have just spoken , Mr Tomlinson , Mr Wemheuer and Mr Kellett-Bowman
technicalities
All of us want a Europe without frontiers
But we know that a Europe without controls is a dangerous thing
Europe without borders facilitates trade
But a Europe without controls facilitates organised crime
anyone who pays tax cannot fight against someone who does not
Europe which is the result of bad government and towards which a few steps have now been made
like the symbols of progress
That is what has happened in Europe
We have been ill-governed
the main beneficiary of all of this utopia which has been preached by the so called 'pro-Europeans'
Enough is enough or , as Aristotle said , ananke stenai
We have to stop and think
We have to bring an end to Utopia without abandoning our dreams
We have to put into practice what we think will be best for the people who will come after us
That certainly does not mean political actions and forging ahead regardless , leaping without looking , without first of all putting our house in order
Here I am speaking on behalf of the unemployed of Europe
I am also speaking here on behalf of those who have gone bankrupt because those ruling Europe have been careless
And I am speaking here on behalf of those who want Europe to continue in unity and in quality
Mr President , I too find it easy to echo the questions raised by previous speakers
things are still not working properly why is it necessary to extend the system
Could the Commission not have waited
At the moment the position is that the agreements stipulate conditions
If it is true that in one of the Visegrad states things are in a total mess , what can the Commission do to put things right
Can anything now be done
I have the vague feeling that perhaps nothing can
The big question then is what can be done to improve matters
And my big question is this: how are the PHARE funds being used
What influence has Mr Monti over the way in which PHARE funds are used
Does he receive regular reports on the length of waiting times at border crossings
Is he able to influence the way in which funds are used for new buildings , training courses and all that kind of thing
an active use of PHARE funds
I should appreciate a reply to these questions
interests that we administer in the European budget
to decide to extend the Transit System to include the Visegrad countries
is the astounding part - by means of the written procedure
have to accept as a result of fraud in the Transit System
Am I right in assuming that even beforehand the Commission did not hold any collective discussions about the question of extending the Transit System
you and the other Commissioners - came to any political understanding of what it would mean if we extended this system
Finally , Mr Monti , my last question is this
to have been taken into consideration
Mr President , I think Mr Monti really deserves a prize for boundless optimism
us
A number of experts gave the lie to that yesterday before the selfsame committee of inquiry
So , for example , did Mr Duquesne who is the father of the T1 system
He tells us that the T1 system is well and truly defunct and that is a fact
Fraud within the European Union is on a huge scale
francs
I am quoting Mr Duquesne
a long way to go to develop an administration of this kind
Moreover , and we should not forget the fact , Eastern Europe is to some extent controlled by a number of mafiosi , Russian and others
To my mind it is madness to transplant a poorly functioning system lock stock and barrel to an administration which is not yet well organized
Certainly the Visegrad countries must be helped , for example by the launch of projects , good training projects of which PHARE is one
The problem comes down to one of democracy
No collective decision was taken within the Commission
Who took specific decisions
What exactly happened in Interlaken
It reminds me , for example , of the debates we had here in Parliament on GATT
On that occasion too everything was approved without us really appreciating the full implications of it all
All too often experts are given centre stage together with technical specialists who supposedly take the political decisions
It is not right that technical specialists should speak on behalf of the politicians
A number of questions occur to me , following on from the earlier questions
How has the monitoring procedure been working since 1 July
A draft to modify the transit system is being worked on
What about the timing , please
When exactly is this to be presented
Will it be presented to the European Parliament and how will the decision be taken
to make an evaluation and that using this corridor we could devise pilot projects as a way of taking our work forward
We have started far too soon , without preparation , and such preparation as there was done only by officials and that is in no way good enough
never done yet
Mr President , the Commission rightly maintains that widening of the Community to encompass Eastern and Central Europe is not possible unless there has first been deepening
At the same time this same Commission thinks , and this is the nub of our debate , that the Community transit system can be extended beforehand and unconditionally
That is indeed strange when we are talking , as has become manifest here , about a system in deep crisis
required to introduce the system and that this is also the background to the decision taken at Interlaken
But I would like to know what percentage of all customs officials in those countries are trained to operate this kind of system
and our external border for transit will thus be moved to Northern Iraq , Iran and Azerbaijan
Customs authorities coinciding with the arrival of the single market
This is where the main cause of the transit problems seems to lie , in Customs and in the delay in , among other things , harmonizing taxes throughout Europe
The handling of VAT , which is paid at source rather than at destination , may add incentives for transit fraud
The structure of the Common Agricultural Policy , with its export refunds , has also encouraged the fraudulent use and abuse of the transit system
Freedom of trade is not something which can be exported , it is something which must grow from roots within the national economic systems
and obstacles , and that a system as potentially excellent as the common transit system meets with instances of misuse and fraud
Customs systems of those countries
I very much doubt whether the Commission currently possesses the resources and commitment to set about strengthening , as other speakers have already mentioned , the Customs systems of these Visegrad countries
systems of the Visegrad countries
Mr President , the EU's transit system is in crisis , with rampant fraud and organized crime
fraud
After all it is clear that the Commission has been aware of this situation ever since 1988
How then is it possible to extend such a system before it has been properly reformed
I await your answer with interest as I am keen to learn on what level the decision was taken to extend it
not be better to acknowledge that , take political responsibility and change such a patently wrong decision
Organized crime is a step ahead
There is a need for clarity in the action of politicians
They must not be afraid to acknowledge mistakes and must reform the entire system first
There will be a need for cooperation between the customs authorities and for very clear administrative rules
Obviously , new technology will be needed , very advanced technology , and above all there will be a need for effective control
What is Commissioner Monti prepared to do
having drawn attention to a problem of internal communication to which we shall continue to seek better solutions
ask that the matter be properly looked into
For instance , I am happy to answer the question put by Mrs M√ºller about her letter , to which I have already replied
written procedure
But this does not in the least mean - I do assure you , Mrs M√ºller - that the Commission is any less aware of it
There are decisions , some of the greatest importance , which the Commission takes by the written procedure , which requires the agreement of all its members
Naturally there are no minutes in that case
in a case like this , I do not feel that I have to do so
the Visegrad countries was taken
we have given very careful answers on the basis of the position as then known
expressed by Mr Tomlinson
I would like , however , to give some details on a few points concerning the future generated , as it were , by the past
parties
of the reform which we will have to undertake , there were in fact a blocking move from someone , the problem of revising the rules for decision-making would then undoubtedly arise
With regard to the question of the present and the future , I would like to revert to the point raised on how we at present monitor the Visegrad countries
to accompany the introduction of this system and to ensure effective supervision
additional measures to assist the four contracting parties from 1 July 1996 onwards
Visegrad countries and vice versa , and other measures which I could detail and which were detailed in the committee of inquiry
I would like to add something about the future , which is the direct subject of your questions , Mr Tomlinson
First of all: what line do we propose to take with regard to the reform of the transit system , independently of future extensions
report , which will be forwarded to the European Parliament
This report will comprise an analysis of transit , identification of the problems , suggestions for reform and the conditions for successful reforms
In what way then - and I turn particularly to you , Mr Tomlinson - will the Commission make use of the results of the committee of inquiry
during the consultations and will list the options which the committee considers appropriate
the committee of inquiry
Now what are the reforms of the transit system on which we are actually working
overall management of the system , the strengthening of cooperation between customs and operators , clarification of the responsibilities of the users of the transit system and of the customs authorities
Lastly , with regard to the resources , it has been asked what resources are available to the Commission
1997
this reply of mine to pass unnoticed
work now in progress
- that whilst we might all agree with Commissioner Monti that he gave a comprehensive reply , it was a reply to almost everything except the specific questions that Members asked
That is part of the frustration of our committee of inquiry
Questions are asked specifically on the subjects on which we want information
We do not want the generality of information , we want the specific detail
in other regards , and will then answer the questions
We approach this with a totally open mind
The committee decided not to have a motion to wind up the discussion on the oral question because we did this unusual thing of asking questions to get answers
For the next plenary we might have to consider how to respond to the inadequacy of the responses
Mr President , I say to Mr Tomlinson that I am really sorry but I cannot agree with him
I would like to read out the text of the oral question to which I was asked to give a reply
state of crisis , that there are rising levels of fraud and that the system is in need of fundamental reform'
time as the system has been reformed and that these reforms have been shown to be effective in reducing fraud against the system'
I have articulated , as well as I am able , a response and given an undertaking
- I am always at the disposal of the committee - or here in response to specific questions pertaining to those matters
Mr President , it is very kind of Commissioner Monti to read me out my question
I understood it quite well because I actually wrote it
I also understand quite well the first answer
We then had a series of supplementary questions and it is the latter I was speaking about when I said that they were not answered
like my luck with the United Kingdom lottery
I choose six numbers every week and none of them ever comes up
I asked the Commissioner six supplementary questions and had the same success rate as I have with the national lottery
but on behalf of my political group and I believe he is talking on behalf of all members of the committee of inquiry
And that is what makes the matter so serious , Mr Monti
have prepared elements of a reply and in taking full account of the committee's future conditions , criticisms and proposals
The debate is closed
Votes
Upon several occasions , this House has called for stricter safety standards for passenger ships
international rules
Today , we have before us a proposal for a directive which reflects our wishes
It makes good existing defects , such as the multi-track application of national safety standards
It also has the virtue of attacking the systems of navigation and exploitation of vessels
We cannot close our eyes to passenger safety , and , in giving my support to Mr Stenmarck's report , I must congratulate him on his efforts
After all , we should remember that since 1986 the average number of vessels shipwrecked each year has been 230 , with the loss of more than a thousand people
It is our responsibility , therefore , to take the necessary steps
Langen report
My position of principle is that the rates of value-added tax must be allowed to vary from one Member State to another and must not be harmonized
The European Union must not interfere in this area; this is a question solely for the Member States acting at national level
and in the ways they finance their public sector
In my own country , a relatively high rate of valueadded tax is levied to finance parts of our social security system , which I think is good
Value-added tax is also used as a policy instrument to control the supply and demand of goods/services , depending on the priorities adopted
This possibility and the right of Member States to make use of it must , I believe , continue to be available in the future
at short notice in response to changes in tax rates , whereas consumers have less freedom of choice when it comes to choosing the country in which to consume
Colino Salamanca report
I voted against this report for the following reasons:
1
I am completely opposed to the institution of any new support mechanism in agriculture
Although I understand the good intention , I think that the support will lead to an even greater waste of financial resources in this area
2
I am entirely opposed to the principle that the support should be disbursed to producers' associations , which would then pay it out to the individual producers
This will force the individual producers to become members of the producers' associations in order to receive the support
3
I am likewise opposed to the condition that producers must undertake to deliver their entire harvest to processing industries
your own' schemes
To sum up , I consider that the proposal is a typical example of how a subsidy begets a new subsidy
The problems of agriculture will not be solved in this way
Teverson report
I voted in favour of the report because it gives a good presentation and summary of the advantages and disadvantages of the structural funds
In the longer term , the entire regional policy of the EU must be reformed
The EU Member States must decide for themselves how regional policy efforts are to be deployed , without having to go through Brussels
By reducing taxes and duties in regionally sensitive areas , the EU structural funds can be halved and the number of objective areas and programmes can be reduced
That would increase effectiveness , simplify the support system and reduce bureaucracy both in the Member States and in the EU
Klironomos report
the fact that the measures in question do not match up to the words and cannot reverse , or even begin to rectify , the damage done by Community policy overall
The main lesson of experience as regards Community funding in Greece is that the appropriations have not been equal to the country's needs
In recent years those needs have become more acute as a result , let it be said , of policies imposed by the European Union itself
They are being further increased by the procedure for the pursuit of EMU and the severe fiscal burdens being forced on us in the name of convergence
situation on the frontiers with Turkey and for the purpose of contributing to peace in the wider Balkan area
as a percentage of the Community average , fell over the course of the implementation of the first CSF from 50 % in 1989 to 40 % in 1993
Unfortunately , as far as the second CSF is concerned , we doubt whether it , too , will do very much to assist the development effort in Greece
structural problems of the economy , rather than to the achievement of the objectives and policies of the European Union
One serious weakness of the second CSF , for instance is the very low allocation of funding for the Greek islands
absorption of funding and to monitor its use
Without those conditions , regional inequality and decline and divergence will worsen
by the Council and the Commission
which support is to be assessed
For reasons of principle , Parliament should always endeavour to appoint a rapporteur who does not have any special interest in connection with the question under discussion
There has also been much debate in the European Union as to whether the EU should have a 'greener' budget
which are mentioned briefly in the explanatory statement to the report
Sierra Gonz√°les report
which support is to be assessed
For reasons of principle , Parliament should always endeavour to appoint a rapporteur who does not have any special interest in connection with the question under discussion
this criticism could have been more strongly worded
Support from the structural funds to the Member States is criticized in many quarters in the European Union
Amongst other things , it is felt that the support benefits the rich regions of those countries which receive it more than the poor regions
The results achieved by support from the structural funds are also insufficiently evaluated
These problems are only covered superficially , and it is my impression that the positive aspects are overemphasized at the expense of justified criticism
Schiedermeier report
us , as elected representatives , in the fertile area of local job creation
Mr Schiedermeier's report on this document is a good report , too , as it supplements , elucidates and enriches it
I myself and the Socialist Group , on whose behalf I speak , will certainly be voting for this report
far-reaching for all that
What next
All our countries , to differing extents , are being crippled by unemployment
We can't do very much about it , mainly because we can't agree on the diagnosis
and what they perceive as an excessive degree of regulatory and social protection
The course suggested by this analysis is to restrict state intervention wherever possible - a maximum of deregulation , delegalization and desubsidization
I think this analysis is wrong and that course of action ineffective
But it does sometimes find majority support in this Parliament
European , still has a function of regulation and stimulation
conservatism in Europe
initiatives , government regulation , government stimulation and even , here or there , government subsidies do all have a place
And , what's more , it is undeniably true
This is wonderful
Positions are changing
We are beginning to see glimmerings of understanding
And it is our friend Mr Schiedermeier who produces this report
And this report is not a torpedo
Wonderful
Perhaps I may lose a few votes for our common cause by talking like this
Well , so much the worse: nothing is more important than thinking about what one is doing
All this debate about one small subject opens the way to very large issues
There is a juicy lesson to be learnt , too
their depth
Thinking about the right way to use the machinery of government is not their cup of tea
And so , like the Commission's document , the report did show signs of confusion
effort to enable new services and previously marginalized workers to become viable in the market , and finally the permanent aid needed to make unprofitable services viable
Not all these things can be dealt with in the same way
Clarity of thought is essential to effective government action
We believe we have made a useful contribution to it
We thank the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment for having understood and accepted that contribution
And , ladies and gentlemen , we recommend that you should vote as unanimously as possible in favour of this excellent report
national or regional level
European cooperation can help to build a framework and infrastructure , but really nothing more than that
- more than twice that of its neighbour , the Netherlands , which has less than 7 % unemployment
levies and which has already succeeded in pushing up gross wage costs to the highest level in the European Union
A second comment is one which I think applies to all the reports on employment considered in this House
Once again I deplore the absence of the essential choice in favour of national and European preference
and jobs are debated without at least touching on the taboo subject of immigration and foreign labour - a major element of national and European preference
foreign workers , and incidentally that has nothing to do with xenophobia or anything like that
That concludes the vote
Adjournment of the session
I declare closed the sitting of the European Parliament
(The sitting was closed at 11

The next item is the report (A4-0231/96) by Mr Schiedermeier , on behalf of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment , on the communication from the Commission to the Council and
In the 1993 White Paper on Growth , Competitiveness and Employment , one of the objectives set out was to harness new employment opportunities in the national economies of Europe , in
The communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on a European strategy for encouraging local development and employment initiatives , of 13 June 1995 , also contains , in
addition to an excellent analysis , important proposals , which will have to be implemented in all Member States of the EU as quickly as possible , if governments really are serious about
For example , the Commission is proposing the following seventeen fields on the supply side to be included in the encouragement of local development and employment initiatives: home help , child
care , local shops and handicrafts , assistance for and integration of young people facing difficulties , better housing , security , local public transport services , refurbishment of public facilities in urban areas , tourism , audiovisual
services , cultural heritage , local cultural development , waste management , water services , protection and maintenance of natural areas , monitoring of quality standards , pollution control and the requisite installations , new information and communication
Firstly , there should be no restriction of the Commission's efforts , but , on the contrary , every opportunity should be left open to exploit to the full the seventeen fields on
Secondly , support should be given to the removal of any obstacles standing in the way of this , by means of legal innovations , for example , creating legal forms to facilitate
multiple skilling , particularly in rural areas , and to recognize the status of spouses who provide help , and in connection with this , giving wider powers to the relevant chambers of industry
A scheme should be created for partner-entrepreneurs in non-profit organizations , and labour law and social security regimes should be updated to suit the new ways of working made possible
Thirdly , these local employment-initiative options , which are promising from the cost-benefit point of view , need an effective set of framework regulations and financial instruments , for example: service vouchers , which are
payment instruments that can be used to obtain certain services and which have already been used successfully in Belgium and France; joint local placement funds for a particular urban or
rural area , which bring together savers and project executors; changes in the treatment of operational expenditure vis-√†-vis capital expenditure in terms of public accounting procedures , in order to facilitate investment
Fourthly , there should be no requirement for additional financing instruments in the form of additional taxation , because this would run the risk of being blocked , in Council , by individual
It was for this reason that I proposed my only amendment , because I regard financing by means of a possible one-off tax on CO2 energy as somewhat uncertain , because
in the long term , if it is successful , it will make an ever-decreasing contribution to the funding each year , and because unilateral reliance on this tax would place at risk
In the interests of the unemployed workers of Europe , I hope that the European strategy for encouraging local development and employment initiatives will be rapidly and successfully implemented , and I
also hope that my proposals , which have been drawn up in cooperation with and with the agreement of all the groups within the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment -
I hope , as I said , that the initiative will be rapidly and successfully implemented , in the interests of the unemployed workers , of social peace , and of the people who
Furthermore , I hope that the effective implementation of local development and employment initiatives will be an important step towards the strengthening of local authorities , in other words the practical implementation
It stresses that there is a great potential for jobs in the 'seventeen fields' it lists , especially for those with lower skills , and that market forces alone will not
We are pleased to note that the Irish presidency of the Council intends to focus attention on the contribution which local employment initiatives can make towards solving the problem of
If the obstacles that often help to make those initiatives so short-lived could only be removed , and if the initiatives themselves could be encouraged as described in the strategy
For the last fifteen years , local development and employment initiatives in areas of industrial decline have been preventing regions from dying out , by means of effective management and innovative
Seventeen service areas , in which local authorities have been involved up to now , must not , however , lead to a situation in which women are dismissed from occupations requiring a
It is essential , therefore , that in these areas identified as options for employment initiatives there should also be appropriate remuneration , and it should be possible to obtain vocational qualifications ,
Nevertheless , it is disappointing that the paper by Mrs Wulf-Mathies , Mr Flynn , Mr Fischler and Mrs Bonino does not include a substantial section on local employment initiatives , despite the
Above all else , we are asking the Commission finally to change its policies , which have to date had a deleterious effect on local employment initiatives , and we are asking
The report manages to blend in the opinions of our other interested and competent parliamentary committees , and it comes before the House in its present form after a great
In addition , I think that I should say at the outset that the Commission communication that we are discussing and being asked to pass judgment on today - a communication ,
Mr Flynn , with which we are all very familiar - is the tip of an iceberg , the fruit of much analytical work , of work which is not only , or not
At the same time , developments in society the length and breadth of Europe , which of late have been very profound or come with great rapidity , have clearly altered the
Many of those needs , the needs today of our citizens , of three-quarters of society , are not catered for by the conventional forms of employment , and I believe that this
They are linked and can have effects one on the other , and I would describe them as indicative in that it is possible that other , new , forms of work
I believe that this approach , with this communication , this text and this contribution today by the European Parliament , really can provide the key to getting to grips with the
What is needed , of course , is for this mainly theoretical piece of work to be put into practice , to be given expression and real shape in society , to become a
Allow me to say , in concluding , that we consider this approach to be truly creative and that we are therefore looking forward to the next phase from the Irish
I am thinking of , for example , the documents presented by Mrs Wulf-Mathies to the Council of Ministers on Regional Planning in Venice and the first Commission report on the
Furthermore , the governments of some Member States , France in particular , are now sending out strong signals of recognising the potential of local employment and the role of small companies , where
I should like to mention here new areas of services such as maintaining local the heritage , making proper use of urban public spaces , information technologies , leisure and activities for
I must point out that in 1991 Portugal was the country which made the biggest commitment to launching a European strategy for promoting local development and employment initiatives , something
On the other hand , we must bear in mind that employment must not be created at the cost of company competitiveness nor by means of a return to huge unwieldy
The Commission's current idea is to regard local development and employment initiatives as an important and valuable aid towards the creation of jobs , and calculates that , on an EU-wide basis ,
These will be jobs in the regions , jobs in rural areas , which we must create if we want to maintain and strengthen rural areas in the long term as
Shopping for food and other everyday requirements can often be a problem , not only for the elderly , but also for young families living in a village , where the husband
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , going beyond the Member States' need to develop economically and socially , with the eternal objective of improving the living standards of their people , we
must now tackle urgently , and with special attention , measures and practical and efficient actions to combat unemployment , that scourge which is unfortunately growing in the European continent and threatens to
There is no doubt at all that these local initiatives are of great importance for creating jobs and it would be a good thing for small companies , including very small
In general , the UPE Group is completely in agreement with the Commission communication on the European strategy of incentives for local development and employment initiatives and the well-drafted Schiedermeier report
In truth , the Commission - fulfilling its role of carrying out research into the interest and operations of these initiatives and the creation of the necessary stimuli for their creation
and development in the Member States and defining the most appropriate areas , especially in the tertiary sector , where new opportunities for employment could best be explored - has made a
Along the same lines , this report calls for more Commission intervention , either by coordinating actions , disseminating or exchanging past experiences or acting as the main vehicle for bringing about fresh
It is precisely this financial support which has to be increased just as we must try and eliminate any administrative or other obstacles which come in the way of the
Since we know the main obstacles which crop up when setting up small local companies , especially in terms of the cost of necessary funding , we have to have an
overall strategy in which these aspects can be considered and which do not prevent us from attaining the final objective , in other words , at the end of the day , fighting
Finally , I should like to point out that , if we take a closer look at this report , we can see some less positive aspects which , without lessening the overall effects
I am thinking in particular of point 10 , which proposes approval , with little or no serious basis , of the famous CO2 energy tax which should never be decided at
As I see it , the regions will respond positively , the local authorities , the provincial authorities , but there will be a bottleneck in the Member States at national level because
In my country the Minister for Economic Affairs has calculated that a third of jobs in Belgium come from start-up companies and a third from creative initiatives on the
There are excellent things in the report about protecting areas of natural beauty and I think we shall have to move towards switching funds in the farm budgets into
I should like very briefly to outline my home town's efforts to resolve the problems , as they are very similar to those in many other towns , and the problems
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , yesterday Mr Schiedermeier gave us an excellent example of a non-factional , expert piece of work , reaching , as we saw in yesterday's debate , from Portugal
to Finland , and this is all the more remarkable if we bear in mind the fact that a number of Member States - Mrs Boogerd-Quaak has mentioned this , and of
I share the view of Mrs Schroedter , but I should just like to point out that progress on the subject of the social economy , which is closely related to the
Firstly , we must take care to ensure that local employment initiatives do not fall into the trap of duplicating other work , on normal working conditions , access to the employment market ,
Secondly , we must incorporate them into more far-reaching objectives which must be pursued at the same time , such as: halving unemployment levels by the year 2000 , decentralization and local
and regional development of the economy , culture and society , as our Portuguese colleagues have pointed out , as well as economic and social reform , and feminization , and that means the balanced
Seen as a whole , this is an important contribution towards replacing the status of women employees with that of female working citizens , and in quantitative terms it is a significant
In the Federal Republic of Germany alone - and you can work this out - with about eight million people affected by unemployment , about one million new jobs will
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , before anything else I must compliment Mr Schiedermeier on his report and thank him most warmly for the cooperative way in which he went
I share his appreciation of the Commission's communication on local employment initiatives which , in our view , have been and still are far too much of an underdeveloped and even
Because , as other speakers have already said , all the research shows that local initiatives do far more to create jobs and do so at a lower cost than the
Because the Socialist Group does not see local initiatives as an alternative to trans-European networks , although we sometimes have difficulties with the nondescript colour of many proposals , but as
a necessary complement to these trans-European networks and we hope that they will have a rather better chance of completion than the TENs with their long and painful progress so
In Belgium , for example , a start was made some time ago on an initiative known as local employment agencies , whereby the unemployed can do odd jobs in addition to
First and foremost , if these local employment initiatives are to be expanded into a promising sector offering employment opportunities for women , who take them up on a huge scale ,
the long-term unemployed and young unemployed people , then it is important that we do not leave them to rot , working in hamburger joints with poor conditions of employment and welfare
The seventeen areas mentioned by the Commission offer potential for development to a large number of projects in the social economy and independent firms which may indeed prove wholly
I agree with other honourable Members that we must do everything possible to ensure that there are no cuts at all in the budget for the European Social Fund
Why not think about creative combinations with large-scale capital projects; to my mind , Commissioner , these is no point in a high-speed train unless it meshes seamlessly into a large-scale
I would thus ask the Commissioner to put a proposal to the Council to widen the mandate of the European Investment Fund to include urban initiatives and not just
Accusations of mismanagement and redundancy therapies on the one hand , and a lack of flexibility or quality deficit on the other , this reciprocal mud-slinging may well fill the newspapers
For example , there is the environmental sector , from waste management to the maintenance of natural areas; there is the housing sector , from security to urban renewal; the everyday-life sector ,
The rapporteur , Mr Schiedermeier , who received the unanimous support of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment , has shown us what is missing: a willingness to cooperate on the part
It is high time that the coordination of specific measures by the Community and specific measures by the Member States , the encouragement of small and medium-sized enterprises , the more
effective use of the structural funds , and the effective implementation of educational programmes , from LEONARDO to LIFELONG LEARNING , were expanded so as to include an important area , namely that of
Acknowledging the importance of the regional and local levels as a fundamental nucleus of the social and economic fabric might be one of the most humane and effective ways ,
It means encouraging people themselves to identify and develop employment at a local level and it means making the most of the job-creating opportunities that exist in some major areas
such services linked to daily life , services linked to leisure and culture , those linked to the environment and housing , as well as many other areas which might appropriately meet the
It is worth pointing out the demand to the Commission to bring about framework conditions which are favourable for local employment initiatives as well as compulsorily introducing financial resources for
The Commission should encourage and promote an exchange of experiences between Member States where local employment initiatives of interest have already been implemented and also will have to play in
Madam President , Commissioner , Mr Schiedermeier's report , the opinions of the various committees , and European Union studies appear already to have recorded more than 17 areas of job creation potential , primarily
However , I do not think that job creation in any of the seventeen fields in the services sector will create jobs on a long-term basis , if it is not
This is the prerequisite for the creation of jobs in the tertiary sector , because without businesses , information and communication technology in particular will not be used at all , and tourism
If fourteen studies on the subject of employment initiatives have already been carried out , and a fifteenth study has been commissioned , then the Brussels bureaucrats have not yet grasped
This means that the framework conditions of national governments must be oriented towards enabling businesses to develop at local level , businesses with innovative products , which can be competitive at
This will only be successful , however , if the nation states are made to see that performance does pay off , and if they do not interpret development policy as meaning
They are at the heart of local economic development strategy and they often arise , when traditional mass employment in an area declines , to develop new services and to offer
They should be at the heart of Europe's attempt to support new employment , to combat discrimination and to facilitate change in the economy which is sensitive to need and
This is not bad in itself but the truth is that in the over-long , overcomplicated , over-bureaucratic processes used for agreeing the structural fund programmes , local employment projects are often
The fact that they are new and different means that all too often they will not have the local contacts , the track record , the knowledge and especially the time it
As this Parliament's rapporteur for Article 10 funding , the innovative projects , I know there is a great demand in the localities and regions to harness European support for their
Then the 150 , 000 to 180 , 000 new jobs a year the Commission projects - the ambitious plans laid down in the Delors White Paper - will be much
Experiences from elsewhere naturally interest us and we hope that we can progress by exchanging information and that we will receive from other areas of the Union good indications
When trying to identify such measures , frequent reference has been made to cooperation among the various parties , and this should be secured locally , including by means of the famous
I am worried about two aspects of the Commission's work , which I otherwise appreciated because it was preceded by an excellent investigation , excellent research work and a very interesting
The first is in a way connected with yesterday's discussion on public services in this House: the Commission is pursuing a number of courses leading to a weakening of the
Furthermore , if it goes on presenting employment proposals which do not complement but replace facilities currently provided by the public services , it seems clear that the financial resources , which
On the one hand , therefore , loss of jobs , loss of services to citizens , loss of the European social model , and on the other not even more work and , probably ,
The second aspect that worries me is that this approach , which is very interesting and ought in any case to be incorporated into a kind of guide and ought , that
We have previously , and again yesterday in this House , deplored the fact that , where jobs for women are concerned , there has been little but talk in the Regional Development
In this case , therefore , as regards this subject , this project is not giving employment to women , whereas women are the main beneficiaries of these services , including in particular those
Madam President , I would like straight away to thank Mr Schiedermeier , the author of this report , for the excellence of this report and also thank the Members of the committee
A very high level of debate has taken place here this morning and it is very encouraging for me and for the Commission to get such strong support from
The promotion of local development and employment initiatives is an important component of this integrated framework and this is the strong point being made by Mrs van Lancker this
I would like to remind you that the economic analysis which has been carried out supports the view that local initiatives , if adequately supported , could create a possible 140 , 000
Mrs Kla√ü made the very important point that of the 17 areas of potential that had been identified the care sector , in particular in its reference to rural development ,
These initiatives also provide a response to the new requirements of our societies , by generating new types of jobs in services for day-to-day living: services that improve the quality
This was very much brought home to us in the debate by Mrs Schroedter and by Mrs Kestelijn-Sierens , who talked about the potential that was there in these new
These initiatives are also frequently part of a local process , which includes public and private partnerships involving various players within society , such as local business , social partners , voluntary bodies and
There are very often excessive direct and indirect labour costs; the difficulty of gaining access to capital and to loans; the low purchasing power of the poorest households and
Secondly , there is the question of training and technical problems which arise , amongst other things , from inappropriate initial training , outdated skills and working conditions in certain traditional sectors and a
I would like to highlight that for the House , and some of the contributions to the debate reflected the need for better skills and better training in the new
These arise from a failure to appreciate the job-creating local development process , sectoral and hierarchical bureaucracies and excessively restrictive short-term financial support which does not enable the long-term survival
We believe that institutions , at all levels , can and must play their part in the creation and promotion of that coherent framework to encourage the development of local employment
Of course , on the other hand , the added value of the Union is provided , particularly through the promotion of experimental and pilot projects and their evaluation , the dissemination of
We are going to hear more about that later this year when we see at first hand in these programmes what the Member States have done to implement these
We have often looked at the bigger issues; now we are coming down to recognize that the great potential exists in local development , local initiatives and the encouragement of
These have often been outshone in the past by the macro-economic strategy but today we find that there are a lot more active policies coming forward to develop local
Finally , I would like to thank you , Mr Schiedermeier , for the encouragement that you have given us all at this time , the widespread unanimous support that is here in this
As an instance of good faith , with the limited funds available to me , I have initiated better use of part of the Social Fund and I announce my decision
to grant a budget of Ecu 25m under Article 6 of the Social Fund for the promotion of innovatory projects and job creation and I am pleased that Mr Nu√übaumer
This Article 6 money is pointed directly at new job opportunities , new innovatory ways of doing things and I feel that we have here the genesis of something special
The next item is the oral question (B4-0682/96-0-0163/96) by Mr Tomlinson , on behalf of the Temporary Committee of Inquiry into the Community Transit System , to the Commission , on further extension
Transit systems are a measure for facilitating trade; commercial operators have well understood the usefulness of this instrument , because in 1995 , two years after the creation of the single market ,
It is in this context that on 1 July 1996 , as part of the pre-accession strategy of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe , the Czech Republic , the Hungarian Republic ,
This first extension of common transit was explicitly provided for by the European agreements , on which the European Parliament expressed a favourable opinion , within the framework of cooperation aimed at
bringing the customs systems of these countries closer to those of the Community by the introduction of a 'bridging' system between the transit regimes of the Community and of these
The accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to the Common Transit Convention is therefore fully in line with these countries' strategies leading up to accession to
During the three years preceding adhesion to the common transit system , the Community , together with the other parties to the Convention , contributed significantly to the preparation of these candidate countries
The decision to extend the system was taken only when the Community and the other contracting parties were convinced of the ability of the Visegrad countries to assume all
The technical assistance supplied to the four new contracting parties is therefore an important acquisition of experience in preparation for the future extension of the Common Transit Convention to Slovenia ,
These candidate countries will of course receive the same technical assistance as the new contracting parties which enabled them to accede to the Convention on 1 July last in
The first measures to assist the new candidates are due to begin next autumn , but without prejudging in any way the possible date of future extensions of the common transit
In any case , as far as the Community is concerned , the decision to issue a formal invitation to accede to the Convention will be adopted only when it has
In association with the Member States , the parties to the Common Transit Convention and the economic operators , the Commission is in fact preparing plans for reforming the transit system
As a result , the transit systems which the candidate countries will join will by then very probably have undergone various further changes , designed to strengthen their management and safeguard them
It is thus clear that , in order to become contracting parties to the Convention , the candidate countries will have to be capable of meeting the obligations of the transit
Lastly , in the context of the battle against transit fraud , I wish to emphasize , as I reminded the Ministers of Finance of the Community and the countries of Central and
Together with the customs provisions of the Common Transit Convention and the collected administrative agreements on transit , this protocol constitutes the legal and administrative framework for cooperation between the
It is in this context that the customs authorities of the contracting parties implement the administrative cooperation which is essential for the proper application of the systems in question , particularly
Mr President , we have heard from Commissioner Monti that the decision to extend the Common Transit Convention to the Visegrad countries was taken by the EC/EFTA Joint Committee in 1996
My second question to Commissioner Monti asks specifically whether the Commission apprised the Visegrad countries themselves of the difficulties being encountered in managing the Community and the common transit systems
Thirdly , has the Commission undertaken any negotiations with any other associated countries with a view to their accession to the Common Transit Convention and will these countries be required to
Commissioner Monti has today shown me a letter which shows quite clearly that the Commission did despatch the information and as publicly as I criticized them yesterday I should
In the course of the work of the committee of inquiry we have repeatedly raised them , right from the start , and with exactly the same degree of clarity and
If we had received answers to these questions , at least answers that we could understand and perhaps even accept , then this debate , or this question about future extension , would not
Of course the Commission has sent us replies , but the replies are such as to raise yet again the question that had already been asked , and we cannot really
tell who is failing to express themselves clearly , the people asking the questions or the people giving the replies , or indeed whether we are simply talking at cross purposes , so
As I see it , the question that lies at the bottom of everything else , and therefore the question that I am now going to ask - since Mr Tomlinson's questions ,
as I have said , are very comprehensive - the question that kept cropping up in committee , was not whether it was right to invite the Visegrad countries to join , or
I believe , and I am sure that no one would dispute it , that of course it is part of our accession strategy that those countries which want to join the
The question was simply , when the Commission itself had recognized what a bad state the Transit System is in , was it necessary , at that moment , to complete the accession
But we simply cannot have a situation - and nobody has yet given us an answer on this point - in which one part of the Commission is sending
This is not going to do anything to reduce the problems , and the longer the committee of inquiry lasts , the more we are convinced that this step , at this
From the answers we have received in the committee it looks as if some customs officers met , put the whole thing together and made it a policy for the Community
I do not want to anticipate the report of the committee of inquiry but before the committee first met four papers were already written which made it clear that
It was quite a problem and , as I say , we had four documents before the committee ever met which would have alerted anybody to the fact that an extension
Concerning the question where , we keep being told about Interlaken and it may be that Interlaken was the place where decisions were taken - high-level decisions taken by lower-placed
I hope that all our warnings and forebodings are not borne out but I should like to be assured of that and that , as a result , there has not
I would be grateful if he would take us into his confidence along the way so that the committee which has been working very hard can be involved and
They have led the committee of inquiry with extraordinary professionalism and I should just like to make a few political comments , because this is a matter of politics and not
That is something which everyone in business has felt in that it is not possible to stand up against imported products on which taxes have not been paid , because
A Europe without borders and with controls , with organised staffing , easily understood legislation , prepared citizens , would be the kind of Europe we would like to have and not the utopian
Forging ahead regardless is typical of people who do not know how to govern , people who want to take political action in order to appear in the newspapers and look
I have no doubt that if Mr Monti fails to introduce this new transit system , organised crime will thank him because , naturally , it is organised crime which will be
One of the hardest things for me to understand is this: if Parliament decides at the beginning of this year to set up a parliamentary committee of inquiry because
customs services in the countries of the European Union are not working properly , despite the fact that these customs services have years of experience with all manner of regulations , if
I think that if it is too late to unravel the mess then all we can do is try to improve things and we can only do that by
Commissioner , would you agree with me that the Commission is not simply the custodian of the Treaties , but that it must do everything imaginable in order to protect the financial
If so , then I should like to ask you how I am supposed to understand your reply to my question of June 5th , as to how the Commission came
On July 24th you replied to my question , to the effect that the Commission took the decision to extend the Transit System to the Visegrad countries - and this
Am I therefore correct in assuming that the Commission did not hold any oral debate in committee at that time with regard to the possible financial repercussions that we shall
Can I therefore conclude that until the setting up of the committee of inquiry the Commission never , at any time , collectively - and here of course I mean principally
Why is it so difficult for you and the Commission to admit , for once , that at a given moment you did not take into consideration something that really ought
Because he told the committee of inquiry on 26 March that there would on no account be further problems in connection with the whole system now so familiar to
Let me quote an example: over the last ten years France supposedly has not received VAT revenue which it should have received to the tune of 50 billion French
So the T1 system does not work within the European Union which is administratively well organized , which is more than can be said of the Visegrad countries which had
Is it not obvious that it would be better to review the situation in stages and , for example , create a corridor at this juncture for the best qualified officials
I hope that Mr Monti will now come back down to earth and at last talk in concrete terms and take account of the true realities , something he has
What I am now hearing from the Commissioner is one of the arguments that the Eastern Europeans or the Central Europeans of the Visegrad countries have all the technical preparation
I have a second question in addition to all the other questions already raised , namely whether it is true that talks are currently in progress with Turkey , under the customs
agreement we have now had with Turkey since the beginning of this year , with a view to concluding an agreement whereby Turkey will form part of the Community transit system
Mr President , Mr Monti himself has told us on previous occasions that the Common Transit System is going through a difficult period because of a loss of efficiency in national
Even in national economic systems such as those of Europe , where the market economy is linked to these nations' history , we find that freedom of trade encounters serious problems
To hope , as Mr Monti does , that an extension of the transit system to countries which are just really starting their transition to a market economy will not cause major
disruption of the already weakened transit system is a very risky venture on the part of the Commission , which could only be conducted successfully in two ways: firstly , with a
huge effort on the part of the national authorities of the Visegrad countries , and secondly with a huge financial effort on the part of the Commission to strengthen the chaotic
So the question I should like to put to Mr Monti is this: does he actually have the financial resources and commitment needed for an improvement of the Customs
How is it possible for the Commission to extend the transit system to other eastern countries before a system in collapse has been completely reformed in order to curb
If it was taken at political rather than administrative level - perhaps by the customs authorities getting together and making it a matter of EU policy - would it
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my warmest thanks to the various Members of Parliament who have contributed and particularly to Mr Tomlinson for having , shall we say , acknowledged receipt and
There is a general fundamental point to which I ask you to give close attention: I am not an optimist - as has been said - I do not close
my eyes to the serious problems of the transit system; when I am convinced that the Commission has made mistakes , I have no difficulty in admitting it , but I do
In her letter she asked me for the minutes of a decision of the Commission: I replied that there are no minutes , because this decision was taken by the
I am certainly willing to admit mistakes made by the Commission when we become aware that mistakes may have been made - and naturally there are some - but
Mr President , this has been a sitting for oral questions which has developed in a very interesting way , because the question has received an answer from me , on which I
am furthermore willing to enlarge , but the opportunity has moreover been seized - understandably and usefully , I would like to say - to discuss not only the future , that is ,
extension or non-extension to new countries , but also the past , for example through the detailed questions put by Mr Kellett-Bowman , concerning when , how , by whom and where the decision about
On these subjects , as the members of the committee of inquiry will recall , we - either I or my services - have had talks at meetings of the committee and
It may very well be that some answers are not considered satisfactory: I am willing to look back to provide further details , but it seems to me that today's
sitting has been directed rather towards the future , and it is concerning the future that I have sought and wish to confirm the Commission's assurances with regard to the concerns
For example , it has been asked how the Commission might react if proposals for reforming the common transit system ran up against the veto of one of the contracting
I have to say that , up to the present , the negotiations within the working group have always made it possible to arrive at a consensus; if , in the process
I have to say that the services of the Commission and the Member States are continuing the close cooperation entered into with the customs authorities of the Visegrad countries
On 10 October 1995 , at the last meeting in Brussels of the task force which organized the technical assistance to the Visegrad countries , agreement was reached on a number of
These are multilateral meetings between the Commission and the Visegrad countries to deal with problems connected with the application of the system; visits by Community customs experts to the
As Director-General Currie said when he came to the committee of inquiry on 17 July , the task force on transit will during the next few days complete its interim
As I have said , the report which the committee is about to present is an interim report: it will be distributed during the next few days to the European
institutions , the Member States and operators; it will be followed by a final report - towards the end of January 1997 , we expect - which will incorporate the contributions made
All this work will take - and is already taking - great account of the points to be developed and of what will then be the final report of
Computerization , the strengthening and extension of the customs union in order to improve cooperation between the customs services and the quality of the checks , especially 'Customs 2000' , the
There are those connected with the 'Customs 2000' programme and there are , as far as the associated countries are concerned , the resources of the PHARE programme: in particular , this
programme includes ECU 800 000 for technical assistance to the countries of central and eastern Europe (CCEE) for customs questions for the period from 1 September 1996 to 1 September
I would like , in conclusion , to repeat that this was my reply to your question , Mr Tomlinson; in view of the wider scope of the debate , I would not like
There will not in the meantime be any extension of the transit system to other countries and , as I have stated in detail , other countries will have to show
that they are able to adjust themselves effectively to the transit system not only as it is today but as it will have been reformed as a result of the
Mr President , I should just like to say - and I am sure in this respect I speak on behalf of all members of the committee who asked questions today
I hope now that Commissioner Monti will read the specific questions , will read the inadequacy of his reply as answers to those questions , interesting as it may have been
' On 1 July 1996 the common transit system was extended to Poland , Hungary and the Czech and Slovak Republics , despite the Commission admission that the system is in a

We do not have time for me to go through the six specific questions I asked but I have to say that my luck with the Commissioner is rather
Mr President , regarding this controversy between Mr Tomlinson and Mr Monti , it is necessary to point out that John Tomlinson is not talking only on behalf of his political group
Mr President , I merely wish to confirm my total readiness to cooperate with the committee of inquiry , both in giving a detailed answer to all questions asked for which we
In 1994 , after the terrible accident to the ferry 'Sea Empress' , we called for a European regulatory framework to be set up which would be consistent with the
Just as the report says , there are at present differences in levels of value-added tax , the explanations for which are of course to be found in the Member States
The idea that value-added tax should only be collected in the country of production poses the risk of further distortions of competition , since the country of production can be switched
This will introduce a distortion by disadvantaging those who produce for the fresh produce market and will inhibit marketing options such as selling part of the harvest through 'pick
First of all I should like to stress that the extravagant optimism , assessments and declarations about the role of the structural funds in Greece , both generally and specifically , cannot conceal
We should also mention the higher level of need imposed by our country's particular geographical configuration and the requirement for Greece to strengthen its position in view of the
With reference to the effectiveness of the European Union's structural measures , I have to point out that Greece was the only one of the Objective 1 countries whose GDP , expressed
For it to do so , the main eligibility criterion would need to be the contribution made by projects to local and regional development and to the combatting of the
We believe that the resources should be increased in line with the problems and needs of our country and that measures must be put in place to speed up the
This situation for Greece is one consequence of the Community's regional policy , and it is being exacerbated rather than improved by the much-vaunted reform of the structural funds carried out
Without in any way wishing to call the rapporteur's objectivity into question , I consider it inappropriate in principle that Parliament's rapporteur should come from the same country as that in
I think it would be desirable to pay greater attention to this and to commit more resources to railway and metro developments in Athens than to the motorway works
Without in any way wishing to call the rapporteur's objectivity into question , I consider it inappropriate in principle that Parliament's rapporteur should come from the same country as that in
While paragraph 6 of the resolution does criticize the fact that a greater share of the investment in transport networks has been in road rather than rail infrastructure , I think
The Commission's communication on the European strategy for encouraging local development and employment initiatives is a very positive document which usefully illuminates and supports the activities pursued by all of
All this prompts a few thoughts on my part , which I shall offer you in a light-hearted way , to cheer up our glum proceedings a little , though they are quite
Those political forces in Europe which argue in favour of liberalization , strongly represented in this parliament , consider the situation mainly attributable to malfunctions of the market , excessively rigid structures
The other line of argument , my own , the social democrat line , holds that even - or especially - in a market economy , the public authority , whether it be national and/or
The fact that we are living through such a serious situation is largely attributable to the under-use of that function , the inhibition of this responsibility by the forces of
And here we have the Commission , where the forces of liberalism carry a lot of weight , calmly telling us that in the limited but important sector of local job creation
When the forces of liberalism find that there are a few cases , after all , where we need the State in order to do something intelligent , they are out of
It is essential to distinguish between market situations , in which an initial handicap has to be offset , and intermediate situations where government aid is needed temporarily to support the
To begin with I agree with the position adopted in this report , namely that employment initiatives are best taken at what the report calls 'local' level , which I would call
If this were not so it would be impossible to explain why , within a European economic area a country like Belgium should have an unemployment rate - almost 15 %
Lest there be any doubt I would add that employment in Belgium is being ruined by a Social-Christian Democrat government which does nothing but think up new taxes and
I know that Mr Schiedermeier's report addresses a very specific topic , but even in this case it seems to me a most unfortunate tradition of this Parliament that unemployment

However , this is not happening and , on the contrary , the procedure for determining this support has been haphazard and arbitrary
In my opinion it is therefore necessary to set out firm criteria
Using the funds in this way is no solution to the problem but is actually a waste of taxpayers' money
out of poverty
We know that one of the best ways to help them out of poverty is to help the entrepreneurs in poorer countries
Entrepreneurs in many poorer countries are crying out for help and open markets and it is important that we support them
But we also have to look within our own borders to see how we are setting up barriers to facilitating trade with poorer countries
and the tariffs on higher value imports to the EU
It is important that we show that the trading system is truly open and that we help the poorest countries as much as possible to eradicate poverty
Mr President , if we are to alleviate poverty in the world , we have to increase global trade
poverty , and millions of people will die
will find themselves unable to live
way we can uplift everyone is to actually increase global trade , and I am very grateful that the new Trade Commissioner-designate is listening to me

Written explanations of vote
in writing
- We are not laissez-faire capitalists and we do believe in state help for workers who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own
We would want that help to be provided by sovereign states to their own workers
We are not , of course , even in favour of EU membership
However , the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund exists and has had money allocated to it
This fund is an unwelcome substitute for help by Member States
If it were to be proposed that British workers should be helped from this fund , I would obviously support it
Therefore , I must reluctantly support Swedish , Dutch and Austrian workers being supported from it
If there should be a No vote , the money would not be handed back to the taxpayer
It would be retained by the EU and then perhaps spent on a much less deserving cause
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was set up to grant additional assistance to workers affected by the consequences of major changes in the structure of international trade

Such situations , which are happening at an alarming rate , require decision makers to think carefully about the European economic and social model as well as its sustainability and its future

As a consequence of the global economic crisis , a total of 744 workers have had to be made redundant in the automotive supply industry in Styria alone
The application rightly submitted by Austria for assistance totalling EUR 5 705 365 from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund has now been approved by the EU
That is absolutely justified , as Austria has been hit particularly hard by the slump in exports
For example , exports of road vehicles and cars have fallen by 51

The fund is contributing to this despoilment
The European Union is an area of solidarity
That spirit is the context for the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund
The fund provides essential support to help the unemployed and victims of the relocations that occur in a globalised context
China and India , often at the price of social , labour and environmental dumping
Once again , the consequences of globalisation are having to be cushioned through the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF)
This time , unfortunately , Styria has also been hard hit
EU for assistance
As with previous applications , everything has been examined very thoroughly and I am pleased that the people of Styria meet all of the requirements
Especially during the current financial and economic crisis , we are being very clearly reminded once again of the negative effects of globalisation
With that in mind , it is even more incomprehensible that Parliament has today adopted a resolution promoting more liberalisation and the breaking down of trade barriers , and hence more globalisation
Until a change of thinking occurs in the EU , we can only work to reduce the damage caused by globalisation in the countries concerned
Therefore , I have voted without reservations in favour of releasing aid from the fund
I endorsed mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund , because the situation in labour markets today demands that we act on behalf of workers
Previous crises were characterised by the fact that they affected specific regions , and were concentrated in one place
At such times , all those who lost their jobs or faced financial problems were able to go abroad to find work or could have several jobs
Today , in relation to the global character of the financial crisis , such options are not available
The current situation in the financial markets requires that we support many millions of people who have lost their jobs over the past year
and organising appropriate training , for example , in the use of computers or giving careers advice
and generating an income on their own account represents an opportunity to maintain financial stability and to develop

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work

Sweden has applied for assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in respect of redundancies within the automotive sector in Sweden
We are convinced that free trade and the market economy benefit economic development and we are therefore , in principle , opposed to financial assistance for countries or regions
especially hard
The redundancies made by Volvo Cars are considered by the Commission to have a 'significant negative effect on the local and regional economy' in western Sweden
Volvo Cars is a very important employer in western Sweden
If the European Parliament does not take action , workers at Volvo Cars and its suppliers will be badly affected
The risk of social marginalisation and permanent exclusion is very great , which is something that , as Liberals , we cannot accept
We strongly sympathise with all those affected by unemployment and would very much like to see training made available for them
by the economic crisis
I abstained from the vote on further mobilisation of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund
The vote concerns , among other things , two payments of almost EUR 24 million in total to the car industry in Sweden and Austria
Another request concerns a construction company in the Netherlands
its subcontractors in a vulnerable position
specifically in connection with the policies to combat climate change
not being granted in return for a commitment by the European car industry not to lay off any more of its workers
There is no question of my supporting a policy such as this , since it actually endorses relocations
This amending budget clearly reflects the contradictions in the European Union's budgets
On one hand , its global values are low in comparison with the needs of the economic and social cohesion policies

Yet they rejected the proposals we tabled for reducing the cofinancing requirements , especially at a time of crisis
Such contradictions and irrationalities of Community policy only favour the richest and most developed countries and end up exacerbating social inequalities and regional disparities

Firstly , the current economic situation has , in some cases , caused difficulties for the provision of national cofinancing

Unfortunately , amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left were rejected

I voted against the joint motion for a resolution on the prospects for the Doha Development Agenda following the Seventh WTO Ministerial Conference
vital to successfully conclude the Doha Round , this cannot be done at any price
International trade must take account of Europe's longstanding tradition of cooperating with the poorest countries
the amendments that were designed to balance the text have been accepted
For example , agreeing to step up the negotiations in the services sector (in order to achieve a greater degree of liberalisation) is out of the question
Lastly , I regret that the resolution has endorsed the strengthening of bilateral free trade agreements
This type of agreement is often far more unfavourable to developing countries
Having to face the EU on their own , they have a far weaker negotiating position and tend to be backed into a corner
more fairly
It is therefore important that the Doha Development Agenda take account of that effect and make a real contribution to meeting the Millennium Goals
It is vital for WTO members to continue to avoid adopting protectionist measures , which could have an extremely onerous impact on the world economy
I am convinced that not adopting protectionist measures has led to a better , albeit slow , recovery from the economic crisis we are currently experiencing
It is therefore crucial for WTO members to fight protectionism in their bilateral and multilateral relations in future agreements
global challenges , such as climate change , security and food sovereignty
sustainable development
The WTO could manage globalisation better
trade measures and have led them to adopt economic recovery measures
WTO members must remain committed to actively fighting protectionism
(ILO) , the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) , the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)
I therefore voted in favour
This resolution stresses Parliament's neoliberal positions on the Doha Round , which began in 2001 , albeit with an occasional reference to social issues and the Millennium Development Goals
Its main thrust , however , is the emphasis on total liberalisation of the world market
to the financial , economic , food and social crisis that people are now experiencing , with growing unemployment and poverty
Free trade only serves the interests of the richest countries and the main economic and financial groups
the fight against hunger and poverty
to preserve their economies and public services , particularly in the areas of health , education , water , culture , communications and energy
No , global free trade is not a solution to the current crisis
On the contrary , it is one of its main causes
ultra-competitive global market that swallows them up
the cheap and often low-quality imports that are flooding our markets
or entities that have the same level of development
That way , it is mutually beneficial to the partners involved
For all the rest , trade must be regulated , whether the prophets of ultra-liberalism like it or not
I hope that the Doha Development Round will lead to our establishing fair and equitable trade relations
be preserved
The various imbalances in the system of international trade unfairly help to accentuate the asymmetries between the continents

That will give us a fair trading system of service to everyone
That is the spirit of the Doha Development Programme
After 30 years of free market fundamentalism , the global economy is facing the worst crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s
developing and industrialised countries
My group has always rejected trade liberalisation and its devastating effects , which are contributing to the current financial , economic , climatic and food crisis
For these reasons , I have voted against the Parliament resolution on the WTO ministerial conference and my Group has proposed that a new mandate should be demanded for WTO negotiations
Such a mandate must be adapted to the current state of the world
areas of social justice , the environment , food sovereignty and sustainable agriculture
Democrats for Europe on the Doha Development Agenda and the WTO continues the trend of global liberalisation in all economic areas
There is no doubt that breaking down barriers to trade and increasing trade in some areas brings greater prosperity
We have also seen that free trade , in particular , between similarly developed countries , is also beneficial
However , if the trading partners are too different in terms of their stage of development , there are , in many cases , negative effects for both parties
level of poverty for the people and , as a consequence , more people wanting to migrate to Western countries
On the other hand , Europe has been inundated with cheap goods from the Far East , the manufacture of which has , in many cases , involved the exploitation of workers
Domestic production has been relocated or shut down , which has resulted in unemployment in Europe
From this point of view , therefore , certain barriers to trade , for example , to maintain food sovereignty in Europe , make perfect sense
It should not be forgotten that the liberalisation of services on the financial markets played a huge part in the current financial and economic crisis
order policy and , for this reason , I voted against it
I have today voted against the resolution on the Doha Development Agenda because I am opposed to any kind of liberalisation of public services
I am thinking in particular of the liberalisation of the water supply , health services and services in the energy sector
For the cohesion of society , it is essential that all citizens have access to public services
These services must be provided to a high quality , with respect for the principle of universality and , above all , they must be affordable
In this regard , the national authorities should have a great deal of discretionary power and broad opportunities to shape their services
In this era of globalisation , an effective system for regulating trade is more relevant than ever
This is the role of the World Trade Organisation , which was created in 1995 to replace GATT
play in ensuring that globalisation is managed better and that its benefits are distributed more evenly
Clearly , those who are in favour of protectionism , of turning in on ourselves , are picking the wrong target when they make the WTO the deadly weapon of uncontrolled liberalisation
It was the current Director-General of this United Nations body , Pascal Lamy , who indicated the path to follow in 1999: that , conversely , of controlled globalisation
the Doha Round for developing countries , demands in terms of environmental and social standards , and a Commission-controlled mandate for agricultural matters
In proposing these solutions , we are also pointing out that the European Union must give priority to its political objectives , and not just focus on trade objectives
It is with pleasure that I welcome the resolution about the WTO , because it is an exceptionally important problem at the present time
The crisis is global in nature , and getting out of it as quickly as possible is in the interests of all of us
I think one way of effectively limiting the crisis is to expand world trade
is global in extent , and fighting it requires common instruments used on a world scale
Therefore , we should do everything to speed up negotiations within the framework of the World Trade Organisation because these negotiations are liberalising trade
At the same time , we must adopt sound principles of competitiveness
In these principles , product quality standards and conditions of production are especially important , including in the context of fighting climate change and reducing CO2 emissions
Highly sensitive goods , such as agricultural and food products , require an exceptionally sound approach
also introduce standardisation of some elements of agricultural policy at world level
the problem of safeguarding the world's food supply
In the WTO negotiations , we need to show greater understanding of others and more goodwill
and freedoms and to legalise military intervention and actions introduced under the Lisbon Treaty
Also , the European Parliament has ultimately been excluded from colegislation , examination and control of measures relating to individual rights and anti-terrorist policies , thereby weakening its role on crucial issues

measures against certain persons and entities
prevent terrorism and associated activities
Article 75 and , if so , whether it is acceptable for Parliament to be systematically excluded from the procedure to adopt them
I believe it is clear that the legislator intended to entrust adoption of such measures exclusively to the Council
That move may be based on grounds of swiftness and unity in decision making
Nonetheless , in any non-urgent situation , I believe there would be an advantage in consulting Parliament when such measures are to be adopted
non-state entities
That is unacceptable , because the report itself acknowledges that in practice , it is difficult to distinguish between types of threats , even though it makes some attempts to do so
We realise that another framework of compliance with international law is needed

There is no lack of examples
Kurds and against Cyprus
We therefore voted against this report , even though we agree with some paragraphs in it , particularly where it asks for clarification from the Commission
sanctions , and so on , and respect for the rights of individuals and organisations to defend themselves against such accusations and sanctions
Clearly , this Parliament has chosen to prioritise the rights of suspects over the defence of the nations
If , however , democracies cannot , in fact , combat terrorism by denying their own values , then they cannot allow themselves to give the impression of being lax or weak , either
I fear that this is exactly the impression that this resolution is giving
That is why , the institutional aspects aside , we voted against
the Taliban , as well as persons who threaten the rule of law in Zimbabwe and Somalia

Lastly , on this matter , I regret the highly administrative approach that the Council is maintaining even though we are talking here about measures relating to individual rights

The common sense behind the questions that have been asked goes beyond a mere evaluation of doctrine and the consistency between declared intentions and their interpretation

It is fundamentally important that the way the Treaty of Lisbon is interpreted in legislation corresponds in reality to the stated strengthening of Parliament's powers and competences
at stake and anti-terrorism policies are threatened
mentioned in the question
In recent years , more and more liberties have been curtailed in the name of combating terror
With the SWIFT Agreement and the Stockholm Programme , in particular , the 'transparent person' is becoming ever more a reality
Of course , in a time of modern technology , globalisation and a borderless EU , it is important for the authorities to work together and also to prepare themselves accordingly
However , the state must not sink to the level of the terrorists
We only have to think of the questionable role of the EU and individual Member States in connection with CIA overflights and secret US prisons
The monitoring of legality is an important counterweight to ensure that an accused is afforded the minimum rights according to the requirements of a modern democracy
The report in question is not clear enough in terms of its approach and also says too little about past failures and data protection issues
I have therefore abstained from the vote
(CS) I voted against the B√∂ge report on releasing resources from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund because , particularly in the case of the Austrian request , it involves a highly unsystematic
If there must be time limited individual support aimed at assisting workers affected by redundancies as a result of globalisation , such support must relate to real individual needs and
Mr President , the reason that I think many of us are interested in trade is really the idea of how we help those in the very poorest countries to get
In many cases , poorer countries see the trade rules as skewed against them and they look at things like the common agricultural policy , cotton subsidies , sanitary and phytosanitary standards ,
If we go down the path of protectionism because of the world's current financial crisis , the only thing we will do is delay bringing millions of people out of
If we do not grasp this challenge right now and look forward beyond this crisis , we will leave behind a legacy of such awful proportions that a billion people

Portugal , Germany , Spain , the Netherlands , Sweden , Ireland and Austria have already applied to it , which shows that this problem affects Member States in different geographical areas and with different
For these to succeed , we must provide support , remove burdens and cut out unjustifiable red tape for those who are still willing to risk starting new businesses and joining
No matter how much assistance is granted to workers , it will be worthless if companies keep closing down one after the other and if we cannot reverse the investment drain
The cases in question , which I endorse , concern Sweden , Austria and the Netherlands , and they have won broad support in the parliamentary committees concerned , both for tabling the motion for
Although we maintain our critical position regarding the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund , since we believe it would have been more important to adopt measures to prevent unemployment in the first
This case concerns the mobilisation of approximately EUR 16 million for Sweden , Austria and the Netherlands in order to provide assistance for workers made redundant in the car making and
This is the fifth time the fund has been mobilised in 2009 , making an overall amount of EUR 53 million that has been used out of the EUR 500 million
It is quite symptomatic that little more than 10% of the planned amount has been used during a period of severe social crisis , and that in itself at least
Its aim is to protect jobs and to make it easier for workers who have been made redundant following changes in the structure of international trade and the global
Three years on from its creation in 2006 , and in the current context of global economic and financial crisis , it was crucial to ease the conditions governing use of this
Sweden , Austria and the Netherlands are today the target of these more effective and rapid measures , and I look forward to all the EU Member States having greater access
Linked as it is to the financial framework for 2007-2013 , the maximum annual amount of the Fund may not exceed EUR 500 million , but it is crucial that these
As a result of the close interconnection between the companies in the automotive industry and the low-level of diversification of many suppliers , the crisis is being felt throughout the

That is even more the case when we realise that an increasing number of companies is relocating , taking advantage of the reduced labour costs found in various countries , particularly
A total of 744 people from nine different companies have lost their jobs over the last few months , and that is why the Province of Styria has asked the
I am not , of course , talking only about help in looking for work , but also about using the elasticity of the labour market , helping workers to gain new qualifications
Most of the money in the EGF should be designated for promoting entrepreneurship and giving assistance with self-employment because , when people have lost their job , setting up a business
I think that programmes like the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund are very much needed , because they respond to a specific situation and help directly those who have suffered most from
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is a tool that is now being increasingly used by the European Parliament due to the difficult stage of economic convergence our continent is
This shows that , in the face of the crisis , the European Parliament has been able to adopt political measures to benefit the citizens we represent through a synergy of wide-ranging
For this reason , I voted in favour of this Fund in the certainty that it will constitute a fundamental tool of professional and hence social integration for workers who
However , this economic crisis has been deeper than any crisis that Europe has experienced since the 1930s and has hit car manufacturers in Sweden , and Volvo Cars in particular ,
Sweden is a net contributor to the EU and it is therefore important that employees in firms operating in Sweden also receive assistance from the EU if they are affected
The car industry is the main beneficiary of this fund , even though it is constantly closing factories , relocating its production , laying off a substantial amount of its workforce and placing
In addition , it has received other types of financial aid from the Member States within the context of economic recovery plans , as well as other forms of support granted
These funds , which are intended to be used to train people who have been made redundant - a necessary measure if they are to find a new job - are
On the other hand , the funds have not been spent , because the countries that were most in need of that money found it difficult to budget for the required
The report itself justifies our position when it stresses that 'there are different reasons for the apparent slow-down in payments compared to the expected rhythm depending on the Member State
Secondly , the fact that Rural Development implementation in 2009 shows a less dynamic profile than the relevant year of the previous programming period is explained by the late approval

I consider that the liberalisation of trade and its catastrophic results , which have contributed to the current financial , economic , climate and food crisis , and to job losses , poverty and

I did so from a general perspective because it clearly lacks vision in terms of promoting development and respect for developing countries , but more specifically because , while it is
Moreover , on the subject of agriculture and the liberalisation of services , I do not support the approach recommended by this resolution , all the more so since not all of
In my view , the Doha Round is fundamentally important for international trade and may greatly help to reduce poverty in developing countries and to share out the benefits of globalisation

It refuses to accept that it is time to change priorities in international trade and to reject free trade on the grounds of the negative contribution it has made
By rejecting our proposed amendments , they said no to a sea change in the negotiations , which would have prioritised development and social advancement , the creation of jobs with rights , and
It is deplorable that they did not consider it a top priority to abolish tax havens , promote food sovereignty and security , support quality public services and respect governments' right
The Doha Round negotiations have faltered from the start and have been at a standstill for a year because of a fundamental problem , namely , the system has reached its
tolerable limits for everyone - be they developed , emerging or least developed , which is the international jargon for those countries that are poverty stricken and forced to integrate into an
In Europe , we live according to the paradox perpetuated by the pseudo-elites who govern us and who want us all to be rich and poor at the same time:
poor , because we have to be underpaid to compete in the trade war that pits us against countries with low levels of pay , and rich , so that we can consume
It was some decades ago that a French winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics came up with the obvious solution: free trade is possible and desirable only between countries
That is why I have endorsed the amendments by my political group , which are aimed at improving this resolution in order to strengthen the demands relating to development; to
request that public services not be called into question in the negotiations on services; to request , in relation to industrial tariffs , that the need to take account of each country's
development level and not to suddenly open these sectors up to competition be recognised; and , lastly , that special and differential treatment for certain types of production in the agricultural sector
In this respect , anything that helps correct the current imbalances is of benefit to everyone and certainly contributes to creating a multilateral system based on fairer and more equitable

Approval of the Minutes
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed
Are there any comments
Mr President , I have a question and a comment concerning page 7 of the Minutes , at least in the Dutch version
I refer to the letter from Mr Pasty to President H√§nsch which was read out yesterday by the President
And particularly to the following sentence: ' I am therfore entitled to wonder what the real reasons behind this letter (of President H√§nsch's) are and what its purpose is
' We heard the text yesterday , of course , but perhaps not everybody took it fully on board
There is a clear insinuation here against the integrity of the President of Parliament
can be allowed to question the integrity of Parliament's President in this manner with impunity
In other words: can he get away with this
Are such procedures acceptable in this House or not
My own view is that this is quite disgraceful and unacceptable
I ask you to put this question to the Bureau: is it acceptable for the integrity of Parliament's President to be questioned in this way
If not , I think the Bureau should consider the consequences
Mr Metten , your comments are not related to the Minutes but to the interpretation of what was said or maintained yesterday
I note your observation
that is a position with which the entire House agrees
Mr President , I wish to draw your attention to an error in the Minutes
not replied to my questions on Serbia
That would make more sense
Mrs Pack , you are absolutely correct
We will see that it is put right
Mr President , on a point of order
relations , on ceremonial occasions and in administrative , legal or financial matters by the President , who may delegate these powers
'
in respect of a case brought by Eurotunnel on the sensitive question of duty-free sales
written and oral submissions which were made on behalf of the House on an issue which is of grave concern to many Members
within that submission quite disturbing in terms of interpretation of the will of Parliament
in writing , what procedures are open to a Member of the House to follow through
If this were the Commission or the Council , I could table a question - I could look for an oral question with debate
But , since it is our own institution , how does the institution account to itself in the matter of delegated powers
Mr Cox , I take note of your request
You have raised an issue that would require much debate at this time to be made clear
I recommend that you address a letter or table a question so that you can receive an absolutely prepared and serious answer
The matter is a serious one and must be considered very carefully
May I remind speakers that they must not speak for longer than one minute
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
Fisheries Council of 19/20 December 1996
The next item is the statement by the Commission on the outcome of the meeting of the Council of Ministers for Fisheries of 19-20 December 1996
be important - about the outcome of the Fisheries Council
the House voted at the November part-session but postponed the debate until this January part-session
The three issues in question are satellite controls , the proposal concerning technical measures and the Fourth Multiannual Guidance Programme
First of all , some information , including some details , on the results and proceedings of the Fisheries Council that took place on 19 December last
it lasted all night - and difficult discussion in which an attempt was made to reach a compromise between the need for conservation and the needs of the fishing industry
Some TACs were cut in Community waters: the TACs for herring , white hake , haddock , flounder , Baltic salmon and sole , for example
As compared with 1996 , the variations in TACs take account of both changes in stock levels and the need to reduce levels of overfishing
Moreover , it has been possible to make some increases , without flying in the face of scientific recommendation - in the case of Atlantic hake and angler fish , for example
with fishing opportunities offered to coastal states
which may help secure compliance with the ICCAT resolutions
This seems to me to be one of the less satisfactory aspects of what happened at the Council
decision
we have been apprised are not successful in halting the decline in sardine stocks: that decline is taking place and the Commission views it with concern
Norway , Greenland , Iceland , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Poland , French Guyana and the Faroe Islands - distributing catch quotas among the Member States for vessels operating in their waters
Similar measures have been taken in relation to NAFO and NEAF
to which the House sent a sizeable delegation , and the presidency underlined the need to build on the impetus that conference had provided
issue on which Parliament has expressed a view , calling for it to be withdrawn
The Council , however , did not state a position on the substance of the actual proposal but asked that it be considered further
On the question of salmon , the United Kingdom - backed by Ireland and Finland - asked for a minimum import price
- that is a recovery in prices - and also because prices rose again during the weeks immediately before Christmas
balanced and more durable solutions
I think that those are all of the points , including the detail , discussed by the Council
on satellite controls
they are currently applied is less than satisfactory; this is something that the House itself has emphasized , and I welcome this
so long ago the mere suggestion that satellite controls should be set up did not get a particularly warm reception from the Member States
The situation has changed then , and the Commission takes the view that the application of new technologies is crucial to filling those gaps
and the length of time they remain at sea are positively established through satellite tracing
the outset
at great length at the November Council
of 1 January 2000 , for all fishing vessels more than 20 metres long , regardless of the area in which they are fishing
regulation will not apply to vessels that fish for less than 24 hours and operate within the 12 nautical mile coastal strip
That seemed to us to be the right thing given that the ultimate objective of controls has to be stock conservation
even though the Commission , like all of you , would have preferred to see more rapid progress
make full use of the financial instruments available to it; within the limits of current resources , priority will therefore be given to implementing satellite controls
The second issue the House has discussed concerns technical measures
as very poor - of the bulk of Atlantic fish stocks
seeks to achieve a substantial reduction in catches of juvenile fish , as this is without doubt one of the major problems of conservation within the common fisheries policy
any rate be taken by 30 June 1997
possible in any discussion that you consider helpful
A final point on MAGP IV
The report by Parliament's Committee on Fisheries skilfully defined the Commission proposal on the Fourth Guidance Programme
the sector and the institutions
It seems to me to be important to stress two elements here
seems inevitable and a matter of urgency
It therefore seems to me that we have a degree of consensus as far as the analysis is concerned
stocks available
we should be focusing our attention , bearing in mind the causes
cut
to accept the idea of adjusting the size of the fleet in line with resources
That is what is at issue in MAGP IV , as the majority of you have , moreover , perfectly understood
has , plainly , to be based on a system of checks that has yet to be devised
At any event , the Commission is prepared to accept that a reduction in capacity should be accompanied by a reduction in activity
It is not , however , prepared to accept a reduction in fishing activity as the sole means of achieving the objective
accurately assessed and offset by implementing the appropriate financial accompanying measures
I have also noted the view expressed in Mr Kofoed's report on the need to suspend shipyard subsidies , which seems to me to be reasonable
date
It has undertaken to reach a decision before the next Council meeting , scheduled for mid-April
and , for the time being , is agreeing to resort to that only once all other forms of reduction have been exhausted
In short , the Council preferred to defer its decision to a later date , although it did agree to the 'fixed' deadline of 30 April 1997
resources for a structural programme plainly cannot be used in the absence of such a programme
in respect of any measures for the benefit of fishing fleets because without a structural programme , we cannot use structural funds
I think the House will recognize the logic of that approach
positive in terms of its general approach , it is inadequate when it comes to control systems and the organization of fleet capacity
is to have a sustainable future , and that the purpose of all of these initiatives is not to destroy the sector but to prepare it for and guarantee its future
required simply by redistributing the fishing effort
I am also certain that all who have been able to gauge the extreme gravity of the situation will endorse that point of view
concern , namely to guarantee this sector a future , is one that is largely shared by all of the European Institutions
delicate issue of fisheries
which the leaders of the major political groups and we ourselves would love to have at our disposal
Mr President , Commissioner , I too have appreciated the points that you , Mrs Bonino , have put to the House
which could , in that way , have been analysed more closely
could not be held in the usual manner
a possible solution
And the problem of satellite monitoring has also been resolved
In that connection , Commissioner , you mentioned the problem of satellite monitoring which is very important and less expensive in technological terms also
course , checks on vessels
work done and programming MAGP IV
There is no doubt that reconciling conservation of stocks with the need to maintain a strategic position in the fishing sector is a complicated and difficult issue
more
Parliament has already worked towards this and we Socialists firmly believe that reconversion should take account of socio-economic conditions
And so I believe it is important that we continue along that path in the future also
May I wish the Bureau and the Fisheries Directorate of the Commission a happy new year
It was indeed very regrettable that we were unable to have a proper debate last December with you , Mrs Bonino
industry in the European Union , especially in the many coastal regions of Europe dependent on this industry for jobs
rather than spending the time on dossiers on which Parliament had already expressed its view
We of course welcome the agreement on satellite monitoring , even although it is only the largest boats that are equipped with this new technology
This fleet which is relatively small but nonetheless important for the EU fishing is at least a start in the new technologies
Mr Bonino , you said we must act decisively if the fishing industry is to survive in the long term in the EU
My group supports you in that view
I should like to ask you , as you have asked us , to work closely together with us to find a solution
Otherwise the crisis in the fisheries sector will not finish , but fishing will
I am quite worried that the present texts being discussed in the Council of Ministers differ considerably from those on which Parliament was consulted
I urge the Commission to respect the right of this House to a further consultation
and the principle of closed areas are essential principles if juvenile fish are to be given a better chance of surviving
The Council of Ministers will be failing in its duty if it does not act immediately or it if waters down the proposals
A transitional solution will only waste valuable time
The fishermen have told us clearly that they want conservation measures
Now we learn today that the Council of Ministers is unwilling to agree to measures for a proper reduction in the fish catch and in the fleet's capacity
Both are needed to restore a balance in the available resources , as you have said
The dangers are real and serious if we do not take control of the situation
Other political forces will dictate action and force their ideas on the fishing industry , including some which want to close down the fishing sector
The remaining months until the North Sea Protection Conference will prove this and public opinion will be manipulated
At the end of the day fishermen will be isolated
That means that we must change our whole way of thinking
not solve the crisis once and for all
For far too long we have been hearing only bad news about the present management of the fishing resources
But we also heard some good news at the hearings
The industry is often prepared to take account of lasting use of resources and thereby put an end to this destructive chase
New Zealand and Iceland are good examples here
I urge you to take their positive experience on board and present suitable proposals to this House
year 2000
I firmly believe that if we all pull together and are guided by realism then the fisheries industry has a future
I am very curious to see what emerges from the Committee on Fisheries in the next two and a half years
Mr President , at the outset I want to say that I welcome the opportunity of discussing aspects of the fishing industry here in Parliament this morning
reports on technical conservation measures
So it is essential that we have this opportunity of highlighting the importance of fishing and the problems confronting the fishing industry throughout Europe
meeting on 19 and 20 December
It is important that Members of this House and in particular members of the Committee on Fisheries be fully briefed at all times in relation to ongoing developments
I want to refer very quickly to the satellite system which all of us support in principle
I am pleased that good sense prevailed both within the Commission and within the Council and that the presidency compromise was eventually accepted
There will not therefore be a burden on vessels under 20 metres
There will not be a burden on vessels fishing in inshore waters where they are at sea no longer than 24 hours
I am also pleased that financial assistance will be available to those who will find it necessary to install such apparatus in their vessels
Surely it is logical that the satellite regulation and system would apply to those boats
The bulk of their fishing is spent outside flagship waters
All of us support the principle of technical conservation measures to reduce the catch of juvenile fish to ensure that the fishing industry will survive for this and future generations
We must ensure that we limit the fishing activity in certain areas and certain seasons where juvenile fish are abundant
We must support the question of closed areas
We must support minimum landing and the square mesh panel
conditions
I am pleased that we will have a further opportunity to discuss technical conservation measures before any decision is taken
This brings me to my fourth point
In European terms my country has a small fleet both in size and numbers
Capacity cuts is not an option for Ireland
The tonnage ceiling was established at a time when the industry was very much in its infancy , largely an inshore fleet
As in all countries , our fishing takes place in coastal regions where there is no alternative source of employment
The constituency I represent is an Objective 1 region
This factor must be taken into consideration
The broad brush approach is neither practical nor realistic
In conclusion , I say to the Commissioner , accompanying measures must be put in place but they should not come from the existing structural funds
Mr President , I also would like to thank the Commissioner for her extensive description of the Council meeting , which is most important
I am also pleased to see that she looks so well
It was widely reported in the British press that she only just survived the end of the meeting
We are glad to see you here , your usual active self
Briefly , concerning the satellite issue , a fairly minor but an important milestone , the most important thing here is that much of the industry has been against this
Obviously they do not like the 'spy in the sky'
I come from the freight industry where we have had the tachograph for years
One thing I have learnt is that people soon learn how to abuse and get round these systems
It is always a question of staying one step ahead
these vessels
She has a great problem in terms of inspection resources
These need to be used to help that process , but there is always a question of abuse
to claim victory , while at the same time , scientists are trying to make decisions on the actual scientific state of the stocks
This seems to me to be a process that will not work , is not right
Sometimes I wonder whether most of ministers' time is spent trying to design their press releases to say that they have all won for their own industries
put on the back burner and we are just looking for political victories
As far as MAGP IV is concerned , I am not surprised that we have had to put this off again until April
That is regrettable because the industry needs to know its future
But I think it is partly an indication of the fact that this particular programme , like the previous ones , will not actually work
I am interested that the Commission has put in a sanction to say that there will be no payments through FIFG until this is agreed
I think that is , in a way , the right approach
which it has to work
The most important aspect of investment for vessels in the future is not that the EU should provide money for reinvestment
That is completely wrong
It is all about the industry understanding what its future will be and then private investment will come into the industry
- in that sort of area there was a complete sell-out
I would ask the Commissioner what she intends to do in the first half of 1997 to start to bring forward the debate about the common fisheries policy post-2000
and 20 December , which decided to adopt and work out new proposals to be approved in principle in the first months of 1997
with contradictions , they do seem to be in keeping with the tenor of the discussion which we have been holding in the European Parliament for a number of months
for additional financial means to compensate for income loss , defend and support non-industrial coastal fishing , and the social stability of fishing communities and the direct and indirect employment provided
Madam Commissioner , I should like to put another question to you because I think that it might be related to this
to renew an agreement which , if I remember right , was established little more than one year ago
Declarations of this type from the Moroccan authorities in my opinion are quite worrying and unacceptable
States , were not used as bargaining chips in order to create conditions in order to renew the Fisheries Agreement
especially when we were discussing the terms of the Commercial Association Agreement with Morocco
and Spanish fishing fleets could never have imagined one month ago
For our part , we think that it is unacceptable to change the periods of biological moratoria agreed in 1995
In other words , we would like to hear your opinions on this matter
the EU fishing fleet under the MAGP; the new regulations for technical measures proposed by the Commission; and satellite transponders , an important aspect of the overall control programme
In addition , the annual TACs were decided
These meetings afforded a rare opportunity to take decisive action to rectify the dangerous situation of the EU fisheries
Unfortunately the Council did not have the courage to make the difficult decisions which need to be made
On the MAGP , everybody admits that the EU fishing fleets are too large
Even the fishing industry itself says that there is overcapacity and that reductions are necessary
However , the Council continues to resist the idea
It currently seems to be attempting to turn MAGP from a programme to reduce fishing fleet capacity by decommissioning , scrapping etc
, into a programme to limit the fishing efforts which the fleets are allowed to make
This amounts to a fundamental reorientation of the goal of the programme and one which , in our opinion , is bound to fail
There are several reasons why this failure is inevitable
I will mention just two
First , fishing vessels are built to fish , so fishing vessel owners are not going to be happy with their vessels sitting idle and losing money
They will exert pressure on politicians to allow them to go fishing to try and make some money
TACs are decided
demands from the industry to allow more fishing
Secondly , such a programme would be extraordinarily difficult to monitor or control
Last year I was rapporteur for the report on the CFP monitoring system
You will recall that fisheries control is the responsibility of the Member States , not the Commission
The basic conclusion of the review conducted by the Commission was that the control programmes in the Member States were totally inadequate and in dire need of improvement
No country had a programme which was sufficient in all areas
It was interesting that the Commission recorded that several countries had failed to meet targets in the statistics on the size and capacity of the national fleets
Instances were found where vessels were larger in reality than was actually indicated in the national registry of vessels
So I would pose the question: how can we be confident that a programme to control the fishing effort of a large and powerful fleet would be successful
We have not even managed to control the amount of fish which is landed , and that is a far simpler task
One agreement has been reached on how much capacity is to be reduced
Another aspect which is important is what capacity is to eliminated
We must ensure that the vessels which remain in the fleets are those which are the least destructive to the marine environment
This would have long-term beneficial consequences for both the fish stocks and for the fishermen
A final matter which gets very little attention is what is done with the vessels
EU fleets are already active in many oceans around the world and often cause considerable damage
problems
The decommissioning schemes put in place must ensure that the MAGP does not simply transfer the problem to other parts of the world
Europe must not be allowed to export its excess capacity
In short , the Greens consider that a rigorous programme of fleet reduction accompanied by compensation for the fishermen thus affected is a fundamental prerequisite for resolving the current crisis
The technical measures are all about trying to increase the selectivity of EU fishing practices
This involves not only the juveniles of commercially important , targeted species but also other species that are not wanted by fishermen
a very serious problem
shrimp catches and others
Once again , the Council is shilly-shallying , working on a compromise version which will weaken the Commission proposal
The fishing industry is being held accountable for the damage it wreaks on the marine community
The proposals of the Commission are a significant step along the path towards a more responsible approach to fishing activities
and is choosing to bow to the pressure of the fishing industry
Mr President , unlike you I was glad that Mrs Bonino had twenty minutes to talk to us
I just wish that I had twenty minutes as well because there are many issues which are very important
I want to make some brief points
Firstly , the Northern Irish fishermen were compensated by the British Government during the negotiations
with the Ulster Unionists
Secondly , there are a couple of problems I want to flag up: one is that the salmon importation from Norway is a problem which will not go away
I would apportion the blame between the British Government and the Commission for not imposing a minimum import price
If they had asked for it earlier , they could have had it but , as the Commissioner says , there is an ongoing investigation and I understand her position
However , there is a worry that the prices might take a nose dive now
I want some reassurance that this will be taken into account
Thirdly , the problem of the size of the UK fleet
failure on the part of the UK to decommission
There is a major problem there which I want to flag up
I have one or two complimentary things to say
conservation measures , about MAGP IV'
which will take into account the views of the fishing sector
I am glad also that the small-scale coastal fishing sector has been exempted from satellite monitoring
That is very important both symbolically and in practice
That is the way we have to go in the future; giving that sector the priority
Finally , I turn to the promise that there will be compensation through accompanying measures for any losses which are inflicted on the fisheries sector
For a long time the farming sector has expected this as of right and the fishing sector has had to survive somehow
I am glad to hear that this is built into the thinking and we will be looking for further specifications along those lines
to discuss fisheries , because this has not received the amount of discussion it should have had over the years - and certainly not last year
As far as TACs and quotas are concerned , it is a bit like the curate's egg: it was good in parts
But I have to question the whole situation last year
The Commission statement on sweeping cuts in the fishing industry right throughout Europe unnecessarily alarmed fishermen
Surely , in this modern day and age there is a better way in which we can carry this out
Is it not time for the Commission , Parliament , the Council , the fishermen and the scientists to approach this in a better way
Is it not time that the scientists and the fishermen got together instead of having the conflicting evidence that we always have
Because , Commissioner , we both know that by August , September , October , November and December of this year , we will go through the whole process again
Nothing has been solved
We will just simply be covering the same ground again
So I would certainly call for a different approach and a different and more constructive attitude by everyone concerned
compromise by the Council and the Commission
before the Council meeting
There was no stitch-up at all: it was just good negotiations
benefit as much as my fishermen in Northern Ireland did
I wish to pay tribute to the UK Government and to the leader of my party for being able to achieve that
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , during their meeting in Brussels on 19 and 20 December last , the Fisheries Ministers reached an agreement on satellite monitoring , on TACs and quotas
They postponed until April 1997 their decision on the plan to reduce the EU fishing fleet known as 'MAGP-IV'
Let me go back over two points in the agreement
The introduction of a satellite monitoring system for European vessels inevitably calls to mind satellite monitoring of agricultural set-aside or the number of cows per hectare
It is the most sophisticated method available to the Community bureaucracy
them as quickly as possible
waters of the Community , since only ships equipped with the famous blue boxes can be located and hence monitored and possibly penalized
The other point agreed by the Fisheries Ministers was an increase in TACs over those initially proposed by the Commission
Out of 116 TACs , only 30 were changed from last year's levels
sacrifice the common fisheries policy on the altar of world-wide free trade
But in the age of the WTO and the globalization of trade , the European Union is alone in respecting certain social , technical and environmental standards in fishing
Community fishermen should not be paying the price of unilateral concessions negotiated by the European Commission in their name
one thing that comes through in all the things that I have read
I know from the fishermen in my own constituency that they have no confidence at all in the scientific advice that is being received on stock levels
scientists regarding stock levels
' Anglo-Scottish are now withdrawing from the European Association of Fish Producers' Associations
There is also the fact that the quota system is not operating to suit market demands
Fishermen are under pressure to catch the quotas for fear of cuts in the following year's allocation
so are the market withdrawals
Last year's figures for my region showed that haddock withdrawals increased by 50 % and whiting withdrawals were up by 30 %
We urgently need to get away from the 'catch it or lose it' mentality
I would urge the Commission to take on board the fact that we need a new approach to stock assessment and quota setting
Unless we have confidence in a new approach , we cannot possibly hope to construct an effective regional management system
the European Parliament
But unfortunately , although that Council was important a priori , we cannot really talk about results , because nothing was decided except the TACs and quotas
crippled in my view - also awaits final approval
All this means we are about to lose a year in providing the sector with three instruments fundamental to its management and development
States than by genuine determination to make progress with fisheries legislation that is coherent and has a future
We see it every year in the blatantly political outcome of the TACs
have been very strong , that is also where I think the Commission has done its worst work
Even admitting - as I have always done - that a reduction of the fleet is essential , the proposal was extreme and highly questionable scientifically
It was one of the priority issues of the year , calling for great flexibility and capacity for compromise , but the Commission proved incapable of dialogue and perhaps lacked common sense
this project , it must either come equipped with serious and guaranteed socio-economic measures or it will be condemned to failure
whether the project is tenuous and mixed , with initiative left to the States in principle , and the Commission making the decisions later
kind of measures it is going to have to submit to and nobody seems to be able to explain them clearly
With the Council in deadlock , the Commission's reaction was to force approval by threatening to withdraw the structural funds for construction and modernization
Quite apart from the legal questions that raises , it was politically out of order and has proved to be a mistake
I have openly criticized the Council's attitude , Madam Commissioner
that
On the other hand , the decision is intolerable and unjust for countries which have complied with the MAGP , because they are the ones best placed to fulfil the subsequent ones
How can good and bad pupils be lumped together
is exclusively directed at punishing the countries that have taken Community measures seriously
which have complied with the reductions in capacity imposed by the European Union
I would have liked to comment on all the other matters dealt with by the Council but as time is short I will not burden Parliament with further issues
Thank you again for being here , Madam Commissioner , and for shedding so much light on these matters
Mr President , I would like to note two encouraging aspects of the decisions taken at the December Fisheries Council
First the announcement , within a year , of more flexible quota management
Taking into account the rate at which quotas are used is an essential and too often neglected factor in the conservation of the resource
to avoid being penalized later , and reprehensible practices like the diversion of quotas will be encouraged
The second positive aspect is the improvement in the accuracy and fairness of monitoring thanks to the adoption of satellite observation , for large ships only of course
I am delighted at the adoption by the Council of many amendments I submitted to the Committee on Fisheries which had been adopted by this Parliament
adopt a plan for a massive reduction in fleets , seems to me to be extremely dangerous
People in coastal regions know that many shipyards are now on a knife-edge
Blockage by the Commission could endanger many of them , since their future now depends on orders benefiting from FIFG aid
The disappearance of these yards would mean considerable job losses in our countries and the irreparable loss of very valuable European know-how
the different types of fishing gear
Finally , the common fisheries policy must not be confined exclusively to issues under the three headings of monitoring , capacities and technical measures
It must be directed to redefining the concept of Community preference in order to achieve better price control
The absence of Community preference , coupled with an overliberal policy on import controls , can only encourage overfishing
a thriving fishing industry in our countries
Mr President , I thought I was down to speak earlier but I see that the big transfer fee from the EPP to the Goldsmith Group got in first
The Council meeting was quite a mixed bag
into the next year and take them off quotas for the following year
This is very much welcomed by the industry
There were other areas where it was obviously thought that discretion was the better part of valour and it was decided to postpone decisions , in particular in MAGP IV
We welcome that too
Industry felt that the proposals on which the Commission had based their original proposals were seriously flawed
The one area where I would take issue with the Commission in particular , though also with the Council , is the matter Mr Macartney alluded to concerning salmon
This issue will not go away
Some regions have been dumping salmon for ten years in the European Union and it is not a new issue
a time and did not reintroduce it
very enthusiastic about dealing with the Norwegians and does not want to introduce restrictions
He is frightened it might cause problems under the EEA agreement while we in the Committee on Fisheries and many people in Parliament take a different view
Apart from that issue , if I were giving the Commissioner a mark for her endeavours at the Council meeting I would give her 6 out of 10
on the fishing industry and deep concern , which is reflected here
on fishing problems
We are happy that she is here this morning and has given a very full explanation of what she has undertaken
a deep lack of trust
It is good that the Commissioner comes here and gives us full explanations and she is entitled to our support for the long-term objectives which she has set out
It is only when we receive full explanations that we can give this support
The lack of trust in the fishing industry in Scotland and Ireland - and it is also true of Spain - is to be regretted
We were disappointed that we did not have some sort of minimum price fixing on imported salmon before the Christmas period
them
will give some measure of protection to European Union producers in this sector which is very important for the poorer regions
I welcome the decision on satellite surveillance of fishing
I did a report on it myself some years ago
At that time the idea of the spy-in-the-sky was an emotive issue
It was being used against the European Union , cited as an effort to invade everybody's privacy
This is absolute nonsense
It is only reasonable that the Community should adopt modern technology which will keep pace with what is happening in other sectors
If the boats get faster and if the nets get bigger and more powerful , it is only natural that we should use all the modern technology available to us
There is a positive side to this , namely safety
Many boats have been lost at sea in years past and if they had had this facility on board lives could have been saved
We are glad that the excessive administrative costs have not been applied to inshore fishermen but , nevertheless , we welcome what has been done so far
So far as fleet reductions are concerned , there is one thing I have to say
It seems always to be bad news
The fishing industry is always being told to make reductions
It never seems to be explained that there is a long-term objective which can bring profits
I saw a report at one time which said that we could increase the catch from European waters by 50 % if we would apply the conservation measures necessary
expect to achieve in the end and , in the meantime , the investment necessary
For social reasons we need to make an investment and I am glad to hear accompanying measures being spoken about
However , I would like to see a bottom line which can give some sort of hope to the disadvantaged regions and the fishing communities
Mr President , I wish to thank the Commissioner for her statement and I agree with almost everything she said
We have to remember that the MAGP policies were introduced in the beginning to balance the European Union's domestic fleets and fishing effort to the European Union waters fishing opportunities
Clearly , fishing fleets are too large , clearly fishing effort is too strong - so we have a big problem
that problem
agreements are I hope respected and monitored
places
They fish mainly from my constituency and they are under very strict control
I appreciate that there are examples of this fishing exclusively outside EU waters in many other Member States
Is it possible that these fishing boats , which are guaranteed to fish outside Member States , should be excluded from the MAGP process altogether
Thank you , Madam Commissioner , for your presence and your statement
I would like to start by saying that I support and value the agreement reached on TACs and quotas in the December Council
It seems reasonable to me and I think the objectives that have been set are balanced in terms of conservation of resources and appropriate exploitation of them
So after that positive assessment , I want to go beyond the actual distribution of this year's quotas and seek to evaluate the whole distribution system itself
succeeded in fulfilling the mission of distributing resources objectively , but , as we see it , it has some important failings today
In the first place , there are serious problems about the system in terms of conservation of resources
Thus the lack of a multi-species TAC system forces some Community fleets to throw species of legal size back into the sea because they do not have a quota
have to be returned to the sea without any benefit to the stock
The system is logically unacceptable from the viewpoint of economic exploitation
And from the viewpoint of resource conservation we are deceiving ourselves because our quotas do not account for actual fish mortality
Moreover , the principle of relative stability clearly discriminates against some Community fleets
For example , the Community fleet under the Spanish flag only has access to 8 species out of the 22 for which there are quotas
some cases involuntarily , when they do not have quotas for those species
amongst other factors , of the extension of fishing limits to 200 miles in 1976 , which also changed historical access to the fishing grounds
resources for Community fleets
the current system is and whether the TACs and quotas should be set on the basis of it
conservation , with equal opportunities for all the ships that form part of what ought to be a Community fleet , that is , a European fleet
And I end with a small comment on the technical measures
The proposal for a regulation on technical measures starts , in my opinion , from the wrong hypothesis
of this fishing is due to illegal activities and lack of effective control , because control is in the hands of the Member States and unfortunately they fail to enforce it
regulations more competitive
So let us make respect for the law the priority
If we toughen and enforce control we will enormously reduce this serious problem of catching young fish
We should not just punish those who comply with the law and respect the technical measures
I think that would be unjust
December and , I am pleased at the choice of this time-slot out of respect for you , Madam Commissioner
I noted three words in your statement: transparency , efficiency and balance
Transparency remains - as we well know - a very important factor in making progress towards an accurate evaluation of overcapacity
So I welcome satellite monitoring , something we have been talking about for years in Parliament
We know that this needed some courage , that it was unpopular
burden on our resources
You then spoke of efficiency
and again for a number of years now
Here also , courage will be needed
This can all be summarized in a few very simple words
but also and above all introduce some selectivity
Lastly , the third word , balance: the necessary balance between the resource and human activity
This is the whole socio-economic aspect
You will easily understand that this concerns us
our coastal regions
We cannot ignore these social and economic worries
We have to do something about this and that is why , personally , I much prefer completing the necessary reduction in fleets to reducing activity in several forms
I believe it would be reasonable not only to improve resource management but also to take account of the socio-economic realities of our coastal regions
and a half years I have had the honour of chairing it
It has not been a time without serious problems , but in spite of all , relations between the Commission and Parliament could not have been better
So thank you , Mrs Bonino
intense frustration and uneasiness
Frustration at the narrow range of the decisions taken and the postponement of the most important ones , and uneasiness because , in my view , some of the decisions are inexplicable
Frustration because MAGP IV and the technical measures were not approved by the Council
The Commission's proposals were drafted without proper thought , realism or composure
would make them easier to accept
Uneasiness , Madam Commissioner , because of the approval of some TACs and quotas which , in my opinion , depart from the line maintained until a few days ago by the Commission
poor state of resources
Something is wrong with the equation
other hand , so many conditions have been introduced into the final wording that the possibility of effective control of the fleets has been seriously limited
with the reduction objectives of the MAGP and those who have ignored them
which in principle constitutes a sufficient legal basis for granting it
resources and the guarantee of a stable future for our fishermen requires , Madam Commissioner
Mr President , I would like to start my speech by mentioning that I disagree with what your predecessor said about the Commissioner's speaking time
Commissioner Bonino is known for not mincing her words
She never tries what I believe the French call 'langue de bois' , or as we say in Spanish , ' vender la moto'
The Commissioner never fudges things
She always gets straight to the point
So the more time she has , the better for us
I urge the Commissioner to take no notice of those comments from the chair , because I think we very much want to listen to her
Having said that , the Commissioner will not mind if I criticize the Commission , specifically on its weakness regarding the biological rest period for cephalopods
has accepted a doubling of the biological rest period , with no explanation and virtually no information , purely on the basis of a few catches by a few Community ships
I have received no explanation
I cannot explain to my fisherman what happened to make the biological rest period suddenly increase from two to four months
I am also concerned about what appears in the agreements adopted in the Joint Committee on the landing of fish in Moroccan ports
Perhaps this has to do with the application of later agreements , but we need more information to appreciate the consequences for our fishermen
repercussions this would have on the commercial and financial concessions granted by the European Union to the Kingdom of Morocco in the framework of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation
Mr President , I have heard many speakers say today that we are frustrated
I have heard that the Council is frustrated
But quite clearly , we are frustrated
There is not enough fish , my friends
That is the crux of the matter
That is the reason why we are gathered here
What we are talking about today is the conflict between the adjustment of capacity and the limiting of activity
Limiting activity is a very difficult issue in the context of the common fisheries policy
I speak from personal experience of the discussions on mesh sizes
You can provide compensation by increasing engine power , so that the mesh size is not so critical
I know a whole range of tricks , since I am perhaps one of the few people here in the House who has been a fisherman himself
Over the last 20 years , we have had a fleet which is so advanced that the same number of vessels can catch three times as much
So it is clear that we have to look at the problem from a different angle
I am strongly in favour of conserving stocks
But the two things - on the one hand adjusting activity , on the other imposing limits and conserving stocks - do not always go hand in hand
That is why we are obliged to adjust capacity and hence reduce the fleet
But this should be done jointly in all the Member States
It cannot be right for some people first to exhaust their own fishing grounds and then to try to exhaust those of their neighbours
We have to act in a consistent way
sector , where we often provide social assistance rather than real agricultural support
Earlier today , we heard about the very high withdrawal prices and the quantity of fish withdrawn , which was extremely large last year
This is helping to protect and maintain a system which does not look towards the future
I put my trust in the Commissioner and support her continuing efforts , whilst joining in the praise which has already been expressed
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , I just want to tackle two subjects: MAGP IV and Morocco
at reducing fishing fleets will be seen as unpopular
our sights very high
That is just what the Commission has done: the Commission has set its sights very high in terms of proposals on the basis of MAGP IV
with
compromise to be reached between the Commission and the Council or else the lack of agreement between the Commission and the Council will only be enhanced
in the Committee on Fisheries
in this kind of blackmail
Finally let us talk about Morocco
The Fisheries Agreements with Morocco will end up in the current form
The future will obviously see the setting up of joint ventures
Commission's part to involve Member States in particular Spain and Portugal in the preparation already or after 1999 , or otherwise all we are doing is postponing the problem
the Council's dossiers
Our debate is therefore the dual outcome of the Council's work and the dossiers you have voted for
you and to deal with each of them at the same time
Forgive me if I forget anybody , but I did try to take as many notes as possible
First of all , let us talk about current events
I shall look first at Morocco
to cephalopods , any other conservation measure could be jointly agreed between the two parties
Starting in November the Moroccan authorities and sector have informed us of their concerns about the resources plan
thus giving the species a period during which it can recover
I think this is quite clear in the final statement from the Joint Commission , so there is no discrimination
It will obviously be necessary to monitor this , but I would like to point out that this was a planned measure which was jointly agreed
I can assure you that it is not the normal custom of the Commission to be subjected to pressure , particularly when there are illegal ship inspections
Attempts can always be made to exert pressure - we need to know if others are subjected to it
As regards the renewal of the agreement , I think it is impossible to impose anything on a sovereign third country
This is a case where a little momentum needs to be imparted
you are political enough to know what political flourishes are - we can reach a calmer , renegotiable position
I can guarantee nothing , but this is the line and these are the activities that the Commission is pursuing
I now pass on to other matters that have been mentioned , and I return to the TACs and quotas
Mr Teverson , I fully share your view
a victory , almost like a Napoleonic night
I also think it would be a good thing if we all committed ourselves to making the TAC and quota issues less dramatic and less exposed to media attention
Because that is not the main issue
The subject is very popular with the media and is given great media coverage
We negotiate all night , we sometimes exchange fish that are not there and in the end everybody has won
I do not know what has been won , but everybody claims victory
I mentioned political flourishes just now
These do not occur only in third countries , and you understand that as well as I do
common fisheries policy is in fact to be found elsewhere , that could help us
That leads me to say something about the future and the way I intend to deal with the debate on the common fisheries policy
from 1997 , committed without prejudice and taboos to a new general review taking us to 2002
it would be a good thing to have a small task force devoting all its time to this work without having to deal with day-to-day management as well
Although Mr Nicholson is no longer here , I am sure that he will read over the minutes of this debate and I wish to say to him 'That's obvious'
you have taken part
more that these opportunities for open debate , almost off the record , will be increasingly accepted
I return to MAGP-IV just to give some more details
In suspending aid to the fishing fleet - not all the aid to the fisheries sector - there is no blackmail
It is automatically a legal result of a shortfall in a MAGP , so there is no blackmail
accept their decisions
I should point out , as is clearly specified in the agreement , that if a MAGP should be concluded by April aid to the fleets will obviously be restored retrospectively
If a decision is reached , nothing will be lost since the aid would be restored , but suspension of aid to the fleet is automatic if there is no restructuring plan
Much has been said about the general lines of the MAGP
I do not want to go over these again
Mr Crampton , I am not convinced by your proposal to withdraw MAGP-IV altogether from the distant water fleets which fish in waters of third countries
world-wide and even in the waters of third countries
We must take care not to find ourselves in a difficult position
So I take note of your idea but I do not think it is viable at the moment
Mr Baldarelli asked me what the position is regarding MAGP-III
I think it is an important prerequisite
MAGP-III , which ended on 31 December , will be evaluated in April according to the rules , so as to be based on data from member countries
So if you can help us in getting member countries to send their data quickly and in similar formats , it would enable us to clarify our ideas considerably
Another word in reply to a group of Members of Parliament , particularly Mr McCartney , Mr McMahon and Mr McCartin , who raised the problem of salmon
Let me first say again that we must not forget that the most efficient producers of salmon record an increase in productivity of between 5 and 6 %
It is clear that prices fall when more salmon is produced and when there is an increase in productivity of 5 to 6 %
The consequences of this are obvious
An additional factor is that , fairly predictably , the price is once again falling after the Christmas festivities
We shall see in the next few weeks what happens , but you also know that the minimum price has not been a very efficient measure
It was more of a political signal
combat dumping
Thus , I would like us to work together to find lasting solutions , even if it means urgently examining what is happening
I hope I have more or less grouped the replies to the questions put to me
If I have forgotten anybody , I will send them a reply in writing
Thank you Mr President , thank you ladies and gentlemen , thank you Mr Arias Ca√±ete
the Commission
Thank you very much , Mrs Bonino
The debate is closed
Community forestry strategy
The next item is the report (A4-0414/96) by Mr Thomas , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on a global Community strategy for the forestry sector
Mr President , I have great pleasure in presenting today my report on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the European Union's forestry strategy
I would first like to point out the procedural significance of this report which constitutes an important historical step for the European Parliament
Article 138b of the Treaty on European Union gives Parliament the right to initiate legislation
sector , which is of considerable importance in all Member States and has implications which touch on the employment , economic prospects and future of millions of citizens of the Union
respond positively to this request by Parliament
Forestry is extremely important in the European Union although , of course , its importance varies in different Member States
When I was in Finland recently , a forest owner said to me that , for Finland , the forestry industry was as important as the automobile industry is in Germany
points out that the commercial utilization of forests should be a priority
However , one has to recognize the diversity of European forests; their multi-functional nature and the need for ecological , economic and social sustainability
This means that forestry strategy must be based on the principle of subsidiarity
as environmental and rural policy
Quite clearly the European Union and its Member States must respect the resolutions approved under the Rio Declaration and the Helsinki Agreement
The resolution concentrates on three different aspects: the protection of forests , their utilization and development , and their extension
As far as protection is concerned , I would like to highlight one important point: the protection of forests against fire
Every year approximately half-a-million hectares of forest are destroyed by fire
This is a massive waste of resources which should be tackled by a coordinated programme at Member State , regional and forest-owner level and by action by the European Union
We need to encourage the utilization of forests not just as a source of timber , but for their environmental and recreational values
These are not mutually exclusive areas of concern
more valuable resource as a means of recreation for our citizens and because of their environmental value
We also need to extend and increase forest resources , respecting biodiversity and the traditional landscape and helping to prevent erosion and desertification
In some parts of the EU it makes sense to promote the sustainable management of agri-forestry systems
and social interests of forests
international level , to coordinate forestry-related concepts more effectively so that they are taken into account in the Union's general trade policies
The Commission should submit an effective action plan to combat ecological and social dumping in relation to imports of timber
Also , the Commission and the Member States should continue to work actively towards an international convention on the protection and sustainability of forest management
There is also the difficult question of how to agree an international certification system concerning the sustainable management of forests
Certification should meet the objectives of enhancing - economically , socially and ecologically - the sustainable use of forests
I hope that I have covered the main aspects of the committee's proposals
heard loud and clear in the Commission
I would like to hear whether the Commissioner will be making a proposal along the lines suggested
in the Agriculture Committee is preserved
I am not prepared to accept amendments which upset this balance
I am , however , accepting some ideas from Members which are useful additions
I emphasize that - useful additions
gives the view of this House on a sector crucial to the future of the European Union
is one of them
of renewable energy Europe has available to it
- particularly in the wake of the enlargement of the European Union - we are now seeing within the Union
I think that the report is structured around three critical issues: the protection , use and development of forests and their enhancement
Commission , has opened up a wide-ranging debate on the whole of the common agricultural policy
There were those who described the arguments of Commissioner Fischler at the Cork Conference as a flight of fancy , an utopian view of the future
offers a wealth of possibilities
that it was appropriate to talk in terms of a genuine common policy for forests
policies such as the CAP
in a more intelligent and targeted way
- and , fortunately , there are many of them - designed to make proper use of the forestry heritage of the European Union
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen
We quite rightly recognise that the report before us on a common forestry strategy had a difficult struggle to see the light of day
And why was that so
Allow me to try to offer a constructive explanation
For many countries forestry represents a vital economic and cultural foundation
The forestry sector is also undoubtedly one with a future
Forests and wooded areas cover 41
5 % of the surface area of the European Union , divided over more than 10 million owners , and 2
8 million people are either directly or indirectly dependent on the forestry sector
And so it is easy to understand why forests arouse so much passion in the debate
The result is here for all to see
That is why I would like to express my warmest thanks to all who have cooperated in producing this acceptable compromise
I think that this is expressed in the unanimous decision in the Committee on Agriculture
Let me draw attention to another positive aspect
Parliament took the initiative in this case
It is only through this kind of undertaking , I think , that we shall strengthen the role of the European Parliament in the early stages of the debate
We as Members of this House should ever bear that in mind
Some points in this report merit particular attention in my view , particular from the Austrian angle , which is of course very close to my own
Austria has 3
87 million hectares of wooded area of which 86 % is managed
Some 250 , 000 persons depend either directly or indirectly on the forestry sector or work in it
The main roles of forests is defined as their economic utilisation and their value in environmental and leisure terms
I think it important that these roles are seen as a whole
I think it would be a mistake to equate economic utilisation with exploiting natural resources
Only planned and particularly sustainable management can guarantee the ecological balance of forests in the long term
And to ensure this economic balance in the forests we must have responsible hunting
Forest management is of prime importance for mountain areas in particular , which are well known to suffer from neglect in other agriculture management
Wood has become a basic element as a raw material , a work material and also as a source of energy
An increase in the use of biomass , as we hope for , will certainly lead to a greater demand for wood
There is no need for me to dwell on the many other varied uses of wood
But one thing is clear: wood , as a renewable raw material , is a product which we must value more
The question immediately arises of expanding forestry resources
to manage rural areas
It goes without saying that we should reforest in order to prevent erosion or protect woods
But caution is needed in areas where natural landscapes would be altered
Our guiding principle should continue to be , not afforestation , but the preservation of wooded areas
We all know that throughout the EU , with the exception of Greece , forest expansion is greater than depletion
I think that the report takes proper account of fire protection , use of pesticides and the biological resources of the forests
Ladies and gentlemen , I hope that you will vote in favour of this compromise for a common forestry strategy in the EU
Mr President , it is not easy to venture into the issue of Europe's forests without running the risk of getting hopelessly lost
proposals on which we shall be able to work in the future
forest of Finland to the eucalyptus forest of Portugal and the palms of the Canaries
be applied to the lowest level
resources
In the second paragraph of that same Section (A) , there is , however , a contradiction , since general criteria for use of forests are proposed , whereas differing criteria are needed
only in the use of forests to obtain wood but in tourism and recreational activity , triggering different problems , beginning with hydrogeological protection of the land
of a lack of resources or because of a failure to cultivate them properly , neglect results in damage to forests
In cases of that kind , it is appropriate to earmark specific aid for that purpose
All forms of coordination and association between owners have also to be encouraged , as is stated in paragraph 12 which refers to increasing forest resources
above all , farmers who have day-to-day experience of what is happening in the forests and should become their indirect controllers and custodians
that is dynamic and able to take a broad range of action
If we are to do this , we have to be resolute in tackling the last chapter of the report which discusses the issue of funding
to be a European forestry register , diversified criteria for use , clear rules , technical assessment and protection from dangers
both the promoter and user of forests but , above all , shoulder responsibility for the survival of forests
The debate will now be suspended , to resume at 3 p
m
We now proceed to the votes
Statement by the President
Head of the Israeli Government , and Mr Yasser Arafat , President of the Palestinian Council
for repeatedly by the European Parliament
to these discussions
I think I speak for all of you when I say that
(Applause)
Votes
Mr President , my group considers the time allocated to us on Monday for this important motion for a resolution is too short
That is why we shall abstain in the vote , but it does not mean that we do not approve of this resolution and the gist of its content
Thank you very much , Mr H√§nsch
May I suggest that perhaps the most appropriate course would have been an explanation after the vote rather than a point of order , as you know
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr President , on a point of order
I am sorry to be a spoilsport , but I wonder whether you could give a ruling
our votes
Is it your ruling that only Members of the European Parliament should be sitting in the seats when voting is going on
in my view , she should not be there
(Mixed reactions)
be seated beside the person who is taking the decision on behalf of the group
progress of the votes for the benefit of all
Other people should not be here , of course
currency
But when we look more closely at it , this great victory appears very dubious
Let us read the final communiqu√© from the European Council
, which means in plain language that the European Council has serious misgivings about certain points
Member States , the Commission and the Council to apply the stability agreement rigorously'
By dissecting the communiqu√© , we thus discover that behind the grand declarations there was in reality no commitment , no signature to an overall commitment
There were two reasons for that
sketchy provisions
even to alter constitutions , particularly in Germany and France
In addition , there has not yet been any decision over the two opposing concepts of the stability pact
convergence between very different countries not forming a truly optimum monetary zone
In other words , what would be better: a Europe divided into two or a Europe subjected to a compulsory bureaucratic convergence
This is the dilemma into which the single currency has locked us today
We cannot vote for the resolution as , in many respects , it goes against our own and , above all , our voter's views of the future structure of the EU
We do not believe that the introduction of the EMU will promote growth or employment
Nor do we think it desirable that the EU should take on increased powers in Foreign or Security policy
We believe that each and every one of the EU Member States should have a free and independent vote in international cooperation
The most important task for the EU at the moment is to bring about enlargement to the East
The problems with EU agricultural and regional policies must be resolved as soon as possible so that we can accommodate the new Member States
Much has already been written on (and about) the Irish presidency , its high standard , the Dublin summit , its positive results for the euro , but there is not much about institutions
not to mention unemployment
I will not return to this in detail other than to congratulate the Irish government and to encourage the Dutch presidency which is now beginning
monetary and institutional phase of the Treaty , I wish today to pay tribute to the quality of the work done by small countries in the European entente
say today about a country that changed its government every six months
) , that does not mean that new and longer presidencies would necessarily suit the big countries
countries compared with that of larger ones
who very often 'still believe themselves to be at the centre of the world' when they do not still think of themselves as 'great powers'
There are of course exceptions
but as a Frenchman I know what I am talking about
We have a whole series of objections to the motion for a resolution before us , particularly with reference to the passages on the WTO Conference
The WTO Conference in Singapore was not a 'complete success' , as the Commission continually claims in its official reports
The Commission justifies its claim that it was a 'huge international success' (to quote Sir Leon Brittan in his final press statement of 13
customs reductions for spirits and other alcoholic beverages
European consumers
It is more than doubtful whether it will lead to further substantial price reductions for computer software and the like
It is precisely in my capacity as Parliament's rapporteur on 'Trade and the Environment' that I must unfortunately conclude that the Singapore Conference was an unadulterated failure
Parliament's decisions prior to the WTO Conference were completely ignored; hardly any part of our demands are to be found in the final declaration
Singapore has not brought any progress at all for the environment
I agree with Mr Carlos Pimenta that the Conference was a failure and the WTO Committee on Trade and the Environment (CTE) has failed
The CTE has proved itself incapable of coming to any kind of concrete results in the two years of its work
a further two years
On 'Social Standards' Singapore was also a flop
Here too no institutional advance was made
Sir Leon is not exactly famous for his affection for trade union matters , but here the problem lies first and foremost with the Council
Singapore then you know that so long as such people are in the national governments then there will not be the slightest bit of social progress in world trade
withdrawn , under pressure from some countries
The WTO Conference also failed in matters of transparency and NGO participation
Demonstrations were banned in Singapore during the WTO Conference
There were no official channels for NGOs to make their concerns and expertise known to the negotiating delegations
Important meetings took place in the most intimate composition , even ministers from some third world countries were denied access to these meeting rooms
The NGOs protested strongly in Singapore against the obstacles to their work and thrust a protest declaration into Sir Leon's hand
When you hear him speak now you are convinced that he never read it
Lindqvist (ELDR) , Eriksson , Sepp√§nen , Sj√∂stedt and Svensson (GUE/NGL) , Gahrton , Holm , Lindholm and Sch√∂rling (V) , Bonde , Lis Jensen , Krarup and Sandbaek (I-EDN) , in writing
direction
its composition - have still not been clarified in any detail , the aims of the Irish presidency are quite clear
The aim is for more supranational decisions and a strengthening of the EU's federal operating bodies at the expense of the Member States
This will lead to a considerable loss of democracy
For the foreseeable future , it is activity at national level which will guarantee the democratic legitimacy which our people find acceptable
the First Pillar is also ill thought out
This weakens and in some instances neutralises interparliamentary and interstate cooperation
As Scandinavian opponents to the Union we can also state that the 'core issues' from the Scandinavian countries , openness and the environment have so far met with minimal success
of the EMU project
power for their own purpose and to increase the demand for a central superpower in Europe
We have , it seems , many valid reasons for rejecting the resolution
An important event during the Irish presidency was the first WTO Ministerial Conference held in Singapore in December
Although expectations were not all that high prior to the start of this conference , the outcome may be deemed surprising
It is after all quite something to get 128 countries backing one declaration
The main result of Singapore is perhaps that it strengthened the position of the WTO
A stable and effective multilateral trading system is of great importance for settling trade disputes and placing international trade within a framework of social and ecological rules
Although no great progress was made in Singapore on the liberalization of trade , it is clear that the benefits of free world trade will grow in the next few decades
The agreement to abolish the tariffs on trade in information technology products in the year 2000 is an important step
Trade in information technology involving computers , telecommunications and electronic goods is one of the fastest growing sectors of the world market
But less ambitious results were achieved in the area of government procurement and trade in services and liberalization here will be more difficult
It is less sure that the outcome of the Singapore conference will bring as much advantage to the developing world
dealt with and that trade measures are not the right way to impose these standards
As far as the very poorest countries are concerned , we wish that the Dutch proposal to abolish trade tariffs for these countries had been accepted
Regrettably the idea of proposing an action plan for the least developed countries , which would also include this measure , is a very informal one
Because countries are free to act on the proposal or not , as they wish
It is regrettable that there was no discussion in Singapore of trade and environment and the final communiqu√© contains no clear agreement about the relationship between the two
Rules to protect the environment must be adopted in the WTO on the basis of consensus
The WTO Committee on Trade and Environment will need to make clear recommendations on this in the near future
Otherwise it is very likely that the inclusion of environment policy in the WTO will be put on the back burner
To sum up: it is good that the Singapore conference strengthened the authority of the WTO
A lot more will have to be done at WTO level to combine policy on the environment , social standards and development policy to further liberalization
So we were happy to endorse the paragraphs of the joint motion for a resolution concerning the outcome of the Singapore conference
of the Unemployed' in Ennis:
'Europe's unemployed argued against the Maastricht Treaty because it failed to present any commitment to tackle the plight of the jobless
Since Maastricht , unemployment has soared throughout the EU
We have witnessed a massive widening of the gap between rich and poor
And now , as Governments attempt to meet the Convergence Criteria for monetary union , welfare and social budgets are being slashed
Europe's unemployed are no longer prepared to be sacrificed in the name of a more 'advanced union'
We are demanding that full employment be made the central goal of the new Treaty
The Irish Government , during its presidency of the EU , is in a prime position to ensure that this demand is acted upon
Without such a commitment , Europe will continue to sustain unacceptable levels of unemployment , leading to rising problems of crime , drug abuse , poor health , racism and social disorder
We know that countries which achieve low levels of unemployment have two things in common: a widespread commitment to full employment and institutions to put this commitment into practice
'
I should , however , like to add another , more specific consideration , coming from a colleague in one of the big groups who did not dare to speak his mind here
(DE) Flexibility has been planned as a fall back position of the currency position
Flexibility , however , should not be allowed to become one of the principles of integration
At the most it may remain an exception
It may only solve some transitional problems which are limited in both time and content
And at the same time it must contain aid for Member States willing but not yet able to participate
It must enable these countries to participate
(EN) This man is also quite right
It makes me doubtful about our internal workings that this colleague has found it necessary to use this channel of communication for his dissent
- Revision of the Treaties (B4-0040/97)
We are totally opposed to the idea of increased use of the qualified majority voting for Third Pillar matters
This and the proposed operational capacity of Europol is not the cooperation between free states which we joined on January 1st 1995
We do not think that transferring these matters to supranational level will lead to any increase in efficiency
We consider that every Member State must retain their right of veto in matters of Common Foreign and Security policy , CFSP
This is why we cannot vote for the resolution on this issue
Integration of the Western European Union into the EU goes against Sweden's policy of neutrality and cannot be accepted
Sweden , together with other neutral countries are not members of the WEU which must make integration of these two independent organisations impossible in practice
Our fundamental view that the EU is a cooperation between free states stands in sharp contrast to this resolution making it impossible for us to vote in favour of it
Oomen-Ruijten report (A4-0009/97)
I am very glad that common sense has prevailed on this directive
I was instrumental in seeking amendments to it in Parliament and I am glad to see that the spirit of these is reflected in the final text
I hope that Parliament will support it without amendment
difficult to make purchases at a distance
In particular , I welcome the fact that the directive's provisions on prior information and cancellation rights will not apply to the booking of taxis , hotels , theatre tickets etc
If the rules of the directive had applied here , it would have brought the European Union into disrepute and ridicule , without benefiting consumers
service
I do not regret that the directive does not deal with financial services
It would have been hopelessly complicated to try to tack financial services on to a directive which was not originally aimed at them
a distance , and I am glad that the Commission is now examining this matter
Roth-Behrendt report (A4-0006/97)
We Swedish Social Democrats wish to express our doubts on the compromise proposal under consideration
It is obvious to us that consumers should be able to make their own choice based on a well established system of labelling
Use of the system proposed in this compromise would not enable the consumer to make a conscious choice
The fact that novel food will only be labelled if it differs from natural food in a way which can be scientifically proven minimises the responsibility of the producer
We consider it to be wrong to place full responsibility on European institutions instead
The system will lead to the spread of approved genetically modified foodstuffs which are not labelled
The system ought to be based on the principle of caution , which means that new products should not be permitted if they constitute a risk
food
Despite our reservations , we are voting in favour of the compromise because the alternative is to continue with an unregulated market
This would be even more serious from the consumer's point of view
the proposal relating to novel foods and novel food ingredients
Novel foods (which are no longer equivalent to existing products) and 'genetically modified' foods must be 'labelled' to provide consumers in the European Union with as detailed information as possible
arise over products coming particularly from the USA where genetic engineering in the food industry is already well advanced
This compulsory European Regulation for marketing novel foods and food ingredients is very positive
It provides better safety as regards genetically modified foods
to thank and congratulate Mrs Roth-Behrendt for her work
The BEUC also approves the 'obligation for the Commission to monitor the impact of the regulation on the health , protection and information of consumers'
However , the regulation must be supplemented by an obligation to label genetically modified seeds and raw materials
Once again , the European Parliament has demonstrated the value of its contribution to the introduction of first-class European legislation
We are voting against the Conciliation Committee's joint draft of the European Parliament and Council Regulation on novel food and food ingredients
genetically modified organisms
The draft does not require labelling of these foodstuffs
modified foodstuffs are difficult to predict
which can result from the unrestricted release of novel food onto the market
What is more , there is to be no transparency in the decision making process nor will there be participation by consumer or environmental organisations
The rapporteur stated that the resolution is better than being completely without legal regulations in this area
voting against the joint draft
I am going to vote for the result from the Conciliation Committee on novel foods
I shall vote in favour of this Directive since genetically modified foods will then carry a distinctive label in future
The great majority of the press and consumers' associations have also described the result obtained by the European Parliament at the Conciliation Committee as a great success
of European Socialists , continues to describe the compromise obtained by the European Parliament as insufficient
The arguments of Greenpeace turn out to be partly mistaken and do not take into account the interests of European consumers
For this reason , I have sent to Greenpeace and all the media a precise and detailed five-page reply to the arguments put forward by the environmental organization
Thus , it is claimed that 'the compromise on novel foods constitutes an obstacle to any stronger national legislation'
Now , this objection completely ignores the fact that , within the European internal market , the principle of freedom of movement guarantees the free marketing of products
No national legislation (even if it should exist in the fifteen Member States , which is unlikely) , can be any better than an EU Regulation based on this compromise
consumers
Of course , the compromise is not perfect
scratch
Thus , contrary to what Greenpeace claims , we are not going against the wishes of consumers in Luxembourg nor against the resolution passed in December against genetically modified soya
On the contrary , we are fully aware of our responsibility to protect the health of consumers
by consumer organisations , the public and the press
In the light of political and social circumstances the resulting compromise is a good one
The food industry in particular needs this regulation , not so much for practical , scientifically documented reasons as for political reasons
It needs a secure legal foundation in the debate with politicians , administrations , consumers and the public
If the European regulation were to fail then there would be a risk of re-nationalisation with serious restrictions on competition for the food industry
The only genuinely genetically modified foodstuff ready for marketing is still the 'FlavrSavr Tomato' (USA)
A tomato puree from a similar tomato correspondingly labelled was successfully introduced into Britain this spring
Genetic engineering is playing an increasing role in agricultural useful plants , albeit principally through changes to the agronomic qualities more than changes to the products themselves
With the genetically modified soya seeds used this year in the USA for food production we have seen the first genetically modified plant raw goods arrive in Europe
Some 40 further genetically modified plants will follow in the coming years
Almost 1 , 000 outdoor experiments are being carried out with corn varieties alone; genetically modified corn was admitted in December in the EU
without influencing the products themselves
The most important areas of application of genetic engineering as far as foodstuffs are concerned are to be found in plant breeding
such as starch composition
More and more encouraging results are to be expected in these fields
There are already potato and rapeseed varieties which have been altered in their composition; they are nearly ready to be marketed in Europe
Mrs Roth-Behrendt writes in her report that there is no doubt that the novel foods open up a series of interesting perspectives
Yet consumers are still worried that they could even pose a hazard to human health and the environment
And that is precisely why I think the adoption of this regulation is very important as it regulates both the authorization and the labelling of new kinds of foods
is something new
this regulation and must be authorised
marketed
Where should the line be drawn for the requirements of this regulation
Are we moving towards a time when all food will have to be accompanied by an information leaflet
Any foodstuffs which contain or consist of genetically modified organisms must be labelled as such
products and where labelling is necessary for ethical or health reasons
This lack of 'equivalence' must be determined through a scientific assessment in which changes coming within the natural fluctuations are disregarded
This differentiation meets the demands of the cropper and the foodstuffs monitoring authority for a practical solution and the consumer is also adequately protected and informed
A particular circumstance can only be labelled if it can actually be proved in the end product
This regulation meets the requirements for truth and clarity
situations
use has produced
In addition to this we shall have to inform the consumer of the background and the significance of the procedures used so that he is given reassurance
It is only through well founded explanations that we can combat hysteria and ease the way for novel food on to the European market
Consumers are turning against genetically modified foodstuffs on a massive scale
But genetically modified foods are still on their way to Europe from the USA
No political force will prevent that from happening
That is why the political campaign is being directed towards health and environmental assessments and rules on labelling
consumers
We wish to have extensive labelling rules for products which get through the health and environmental assessments
Mrs Roth-Behrendt should be commended on the impressive result which she has achieved through the conciliation procedure
She really has secured as much as possible from the basis on which we went into the negotiations
There must be no risks for consumers , they must not be misled , and novel foods must not have a lower nutritional value
Parliament has forced through the requirement that all modified foodstuffs are to be labelled , and prevented an exception for plants which are resistant to chemical sprays
Bulk consignments which may contain genetically modified organisms are to be labelled
In this way , feed companies , farmers , abattoirs and the retail trade can make a choice
beans
But consumers wish to know that
The regulation does indeed say that it should be possible to identify genetic modifications , and techniques for detection are being developed all the time
However , the retail sector must take care that its customers do not come to feel deceived , if it wishes to remain in the market
When we adopted the rules on the irradiation of foodstuffs , the technique for detecting it had not been developed
It has been in the meantime , and we have the same hopes with regard to novel foods
value
Surely they should be aware of a production method which can influence sales
The novel foods regulation is essential , because it is the only option at present
This regulation can only be of benefit , as opposed to an internal market with no rules at all
It is too naive to think that the absence of EU rules will lead to 15 excellent national regimes
After 13 redrafts by the Commission and three readings in this House , the novel food regulation remains a deeply flawed piece of legislation
as they come on to the market
Many categories of foodstuffs produced with the aid of gene technology will be regulated under other legislation or not at all
assessments
Only where the food contains a living genetically modified organism will the regulation apply in full
This category would cover raw fruit and vegetables , some dairy products like yoghurt and some beers but not very much else
Even for these products , there will be no long term independent health and safety assessments
Consumers are entitled to clear and consistent information to enable them to make informed choices
The most damning aspect of this regulation is that no-one can say in advance which products will carry a label
A coherent system should be one which provides quite simply that all foods produced using gene technology will be labelled
will say
There is to be no Public Register of approved gene foods , so the transparency provisions currently in force under Directive 90/220 will disappear
customers a choice
In those cases where these are to be labelled , it will be an almost meaningless statement that the product may contain genetically modified material
Austria , Denmark , the Netherlands and the UK all have stronger legislation in the pipeline or voluntary schemes already in existence
As this is an EU regulation entering directly into force in Member States , they will have no opportunity to enact stricter safeguards
labelling
For these reasons , we voted against the adoption of the joint text
This report is incomplete
There are far too many loopholes , exceptions and restrictions to be an acceptable means of regulating 'novel food'
Only food containing live genetically modified organisms will be adequately regulated
The consumer must be able to make a free , individual choice on which food they want to buy and consume
This means that they need to know exactly what they are buying and this is achieved by means of clear labelling on the product
There is no proposal for a joint register of approved genetically modified foodstuffs either
Many Member States such as Denmark , Sweden , Austria and Great Britain already have or are planning stricter legislation or voluntary agreements
in consumer protection in many Member States
Nor is there any ban , regulation or control on genetically modified foodstuffs which may be exported from the EU to other countries
These are the reasons why I have voted against the report
After thirteen redrafts by the Commission and three readings in this House , the novel food regulation remains a deeply flawed piece of legislation
as they come on to the market
Many categories of foodstuffs produced with the aid of gene technology will be regulated under other legislation or not at all
assessments
Only where the food contains a living genetically modified organism will the regulation apply in full
This category would cover raw fruit and vegetables , some dairy products like yoghurt and some beers but not very much else
Even for these products , there will be no long-term independent health and safety assessments

Austria , Denmark , Netherlands and the UK all have stronger legislation in the pipeline or voluntary schemes already in existence
As this is an EU regulation entering directly into force in Member States , they will have no opportunity to enact stricter safeguards
labelling
For these reasons I voted against the adoption of the joint text
The compromise Regulation before us on novel foods and , more generally , on genetically modified organisms does not put an end to the problem
Some progress has undoubtedly been made
The Ciba Geigy transgenic maize modified by the Bacillus thuringiensis bacterium produces an insecticidal biotoxin against pyralis
Other plants have also been modified , ranging from soya or colza to tomatoes or potatoes
Although there are obvious advantages in the ability to economize on herbicides and pesticides , there is also considerable anxiety
Brazil nuts and their allergen are used in soyas to increase their amino acid content
use of herbicides
True , compulsory labelling is being introduced
But labelling of what
Monitored by whom
With what information
With what efficiency , when American cargoes of soya mix natural and modified products together
The legitimate concern of the European agri-foodstuffs industry not to let a monopoly in biotechnology go to Ciba Geigy , Monsanto or Cargill is understandable
But BSE still frightens us
European Commission , the effects produced by the use of transgenic plants in open fields and by the human consumption of novel foods resulting from genetic manipulation
Compliance with such an embargo would enable us to make sure that there was no repetition of the mistakes made with meat meal and contaminated gelatine
We have just approved the regulation on novel foods
This represents progress in the area of preventive health measures and consumer protection
For questions relating to public health we rely on the Scientific Committee on Food
We have no reason to doubt the committee's professionalism or objectivity
But the findings of the temporary committee of inquiry into BSE suggest that caution is advisable
Both the membership of the Scientific Committee and the free availability of its opinion and what the Commission does with it are vitally important
In yesterday's committee of inquiry we welcomed Commission President Santer's intention regarding the scientific committees
We expect these intentions to be translated into decisions , with a view too to the implementation of this regulation
Peijs report (A4-0004/97)
market
that the transfer of credit does not take place
We also consider that the time limit allowed for the transaction should not exceed 12 months
Ladies and gentlemen
Transfers from one Member State to another in the European Union is still a lengthy and expensive business
European citizens and in particular small and medium-sized companies find the difficulties involved not simply annoying but in some cases also extremely expensive
The European single market is not yet a fact of life in this sphere
Meanwhile some banks in border regions have introduced cost-saving methods of transfer
Giro systems which should lead to quicker and cheaper money transfers within the European Union are being set up
I am confident that fair competition between the cross-border transfer systems leads to better , more favourable supply
The present proposal for a directive on cross-border transfers has very definite repercussions on citizens' everyday life in Europe
Our objective was to make cross-border transfers quicker , cheaper and more reliable
I welcome the joint draft before us which represents an excellent solution
original proposal in the citizen's interests
ECU 30 , 000
I think this is particularly important since a series of transactions of small and medium-sized firms now come under this directive
Another important amendment dealt with the credit advice of transfer amounts to the mandator if they had not reached the beneficiary for any reason
Up to ECU 10 , 000 was to be credited back to the mandator under the Council's common position
We finally managed to have this amount increased to ECU 12 , 500
Even although this is well below what Parliament originally asked for I nevertheless believe that we can accept it in view of what we have achieved elsewhere
The case of cross-border transfers is to my mind a clear example of the significance and success of the co-decision procedure
We have seen here that we can achieve a great deal if we enter negotiations with clear objectives
Incidentally I would like to point out that with the introduction of a common currency the importance of the subject will inevitably wane , with the exception of various legal points
In conclusion I wish to thank everyone involved for their hard work which has led to this agreement which is satisfactory to all concerned
I believe that this has overcome another hurdle and taken another step closer to the European single market
Medina Ortega recommendation (A4-0415/96)
On behalf of the French socialist group , I would like to congratulate our rapporteur , Mr Medina Ortega , for the excellent work he has done
Mr Medina has produced this important report unassisted
On the whole , I believe he has found adequate formulae for the protection of personal data in the telecommunications sector
We have had a few difficulties with the second reading amendments
In France , we have a red list system which effectively protects the identity of subscribers wanting this facility in return for a modest fee
On this point , we fear that the proposed free service will weaken the protection of subscribers
The experience of certain States who use this system is not encouraging
We are also concerned by the problem of identification during incoming calls
In some cases (SOS AIDS or SOS Battered Wives for example) , it is vital that the anonymity of the caller is protected
We think the proposed provisions are inadequate
A solution to these problems could have been found in the context of the subsidiarity principle
The amendments dismiss the application of the principle for reasons I do not share
As a result , we could not vote for some of the amendments proposed at second reading
aided by the amendments presented by the European Parliament at first reading , which have been taken into account
However , it would be desirable to limit the Member States' margin of manoeuvre by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity , because the telecommunications sector is essentially transnational
It is likewise important to guarantee that the protection of data and privacy in telecommunications services costs subscribers nothing
Member States
necessary to apply the guarantees laid down in the provisions of this directive
The amendments which guarantee that the protection of data and privacy in telecommunications services do not cost subscribers anything are very important
Operators should not be allowed to demand payment from subscribers for guaranteeing respect for the right to privacy
We agree that the protection of privacy must be free
as this initially involved regulating the issue of protection of personal data and privacy in telecommunications without leaving it to arbitrary decisions of private companies
telecommunications sector because of its essentially transnational character and the defence of the principle of free protection of privacy
Kerr report (A4-0367/96)
The Danish social democrats support the rapporteur's rejection of the change in the definition of the concept of 'transfers'
Changing the definition would involve the risk of a substantial reduction in employees' rights
We are naturally opposed to that
It cannot be right that employees should have to pay because a business changes hands
We are pleased that this report has been adopted at last
It was a difficult struggle , and the careless Swedish translation was just the last straw
Mr Kerr proved himself a successful go-between here
he fended off attempts to exclude either completely or nearly completely from the new regulation the award of services to outside
We welcome that
However , we are still left with the task of finding suitable regulatory means of strengthening the weakened opportunities of participation in relation to the undertaking's organisation and activity
That will be one of the main tasks of the coming post-neoliberal years , we hope
Bertens report (A4-0416/96)
We welcome the initiative of the Commission and the committee for increased cooperation between the EU and the countries of Latin America
A global strategy for economic cooperation should be established along with more intensive political cooperation in order to promote peace , democracy and respect for human rights in Latin America
We do not consider that those aspects of defence between the Union and these countries which we have discussed fall within the framework of this report
Paragraph 25 of this report contains a further increase in the funds already available to Latin America
We believe that the European Union is already one of the biggest contributors in this region
In general terms we are in favour of advancing the process of democracy in this region and the development of the country
is being used properly
Until such time as we have specific figures on these projects we do not wish to comment on this paragraph 25
vote separately on it , we give our approval to this bloc voting while abstaining on paragraph 25
Carnero Gonz√°lez report (A4-0418/96)
Paragraphs 16 and 18 of this report contain a further increase in the funds already available to Central America or a partial exemption from the foreign debts of Central America
In general terms we are in favour of advancing the process of democracy in this region and the development of the country
is being used properly
Until such time as we have specific figures on these projects we do not wish to comment on paragraphs 16 and 18
opportunity to vote separately on them , we give our approval to this bloc voting while abstaining on paragraphs 16 and 18

Community forestry strategy (continuation)
strategy for the forestry sector
Mr President , the European Parliament's proposal for a future EU forestry strategy has changed fundamentally over the year and a half during which it was under consideration in committee
The forestry strategy represents a compromise agreed in committee
its forests , considering how enormously the proposal has been improved in comparison with the original draft
Rather than a common forestry policy , we are now considering a common forestry strategy
The basic point of departure is a recognition of the differences between the Member States' forests , in terms both of conditions and of significance
According to this strategy , the use and protection of forests remain matters for national decision-making
Nonetheless , an effort is being made to work towards common objectives through common action
and social use
The forestry strategy stresses the significance of forests as a renewable natural resource
Correctly used , the forests function as a reserve for sustainable economic development , which means work and prosperity for people
Forestry is among the sectors where open competition prevails in the EU , and industry must operate without subsidies or regulations which distort competition
The forests maintain a living countryside , various industries and much small enterprise , which provides employment
According to the forestry strategy , it is possible to combine the preservation of forests' biodiversity and recreational functions with their so-called economic use
Finland's forestry industry , with its right of access for all and growing reserves of wood , is an excellent example of this
The strategy presents opportunities for the EU to promote environmentally benign exploitation of forests in contexts other than the allocation of regional funding
The EU can be actively involved in bringing influence to bear on the establishment of an international certification system which takes account of the special features of each country
environmentally benign material than unrenewable natural resources
The use of wood and biofuels as energy sources , with the aid of advanced technology , could afford new opportunities for the creation of a greener Europe
The forestry strategy will introduce a stronger environmental element into forestry
diversity of forests
The EU Member States have also committed themselves to these
will be able to agree on the compromise which was its outcome
Mr President , the painful genesis of the Thomas report at least showed that the forestry issues which arise in the various regions of the Union are very different
from the Member States to the Union
on the other hand the Commission is asked in two years' time to produce a legislative programme based particularly on Article 235 of the Treaty
As you know , this article is a kind of black hole by means of which the European Union draws power away from the Member States
In their own proposals , the Greens stress that the forests must be considered in a balanced manner from the points of view of sustainable use , social benefit and environmental protection
We would like the Commission to engage in cooperation , for example with the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) , with the aim of adopting an internationally recognized certification system
In this way the Commission could also help to ensure that this system is adapted to European conditions
If extra funding is wanted for the forestry industry , we recommend that it be used to safeguard the diversity of forests
In our view , the Habitat Directive should be taken seriously , and funding should be found for its conservation area network for forests
In this way it might also be possible to find money to protect Scandinavia's last surviving ancient forests
Mr President , the Helsinki resolutions give an excellent definition of what sustainability means in relation to forestry
The definition takes into account not only the quantitative sustainability but also the ecological sustainability of forestry
The common practice amongst foresters was , until Helsinki , just to stick to the rule that you could not harvest more timber than was growing back
the forests and also the production of non-timber values from forests
The ministerial conference of Helsinki which took place about three-and-a-half years ago took our requirements into consideration
European Union in Helsinki and also to our commitments in the Rio Declaration
The motion for a resolution is , of course , a compromise
I can tell you it took a lot of work behind the scenes to get this compromise
Now let me tell what I do not like in the compromise
Declarations - it makes no sense to say that the commercial utilization of forests should be a priority for the EU strategy
of our forests , especially in threatened areas like mountainous regions; that we ask to take into account the carbon sink function , especially by encouraging the production of long-living forest products
Some people wonder why we do not propose to implement a common forest policy similar to the common agricultural policy , but just a strategy
in the Community to be repeated in the forestry sector
Nevertheless , I think , personally , that it makes sense to introduce a system of price intervention for used paper to promote paper recycling
Wood fibre products are a very precious natural resource and play a role in the carbon sink cycle
The more often they are recycled , the better they fulfil their carbon sink function
Let me now talk about certification
Consumers have the right to know where the products - be it window frames or paper products - come from
There must be transparency of origin
Consumers have the right to know whether wood products come from forests managed on the principle of ecological sustainability or from a destructive operation
the Canadian Standards Association
This system certainly does not guarantee transparency of origin but just serves the interests of an industry that does not want to change
A serious certification system could not only be beneficial to the conservation of our forests but also to the forest owners who manage their forests wisely
scheme would certainly be a big advantage for selling our wood products on the market
Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur , David Thomas , for the work he has done to secure a broadly acceptable compromise
I know this work has not always been easy
European Union
This fact is the premise of the report
However , there should be certain common principles to enable us to safeguard the sustainable use of forests
To this end , a common strategy is needed which takes into account and reconciles the varies types of use to which forests are put and need to be put
The common forestry strategy should take account of the multifunctionality of forests: forests are needed to combat the greenhouse effect , conserve biodiversity and provide opportunities for recreation and landscape values
But forests are also valuable and important as a renewable resource , a source of raw materials and energy for many different industries
rules which distort competition
The EU's forestry strategy should also be based on the coordination of national policies on the basis of common principles
One of the things which should be done at European level is to organize joint research into the development of forestry resources and the health of forests
A relatively large sum has been assigned to forestry in the Union budget: some ECU 400 million
A common strategy is needed to ensure that this money can be used sensibly and not , for example , in ways which distort competition
We need to know what this money is being used for and what our priorities are
Mr President , first , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for an interesting and comprehensive report
The forestry industry is extremely important in my country , Sweden
Our net export of forestry products is approximately 70 billion Crowns which corresponds to 8 billion ECUs
In fact , half of Swedish net exports are products from the forestry industry
We have quite recently introduced legislation in Sweden for the forestry sector
fundamental views of the Rio Conference and Agenda 21
During the preparation of this report , we were very concerned that it would advocate a joint forestry policy with tight control from above
This hazard has been avoided
In my opinion , such a move would have led to greater bureaucracy and a move away from the principles of the market economy
We would all have been the losers under such a proposal
The current proposal includes a number of ideas on cooperation within the sector which can really be of benefit
of which complement national and individual measures
maintain biological diversity
Certification which inspires trust and respect could also be an advantage as part of a joint voluntary regime
It must be in our common interest , in those regions where forests have been devastated , to reinstate this important resource
This could take place within the framework of regional political programmes supported by the EU
The forests of Europe also have an important role to play in terms of the greenhouse effect
burning of fossil fuels
It would be even better if we used a proportion of our joint excess as biological fuel
the future
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it was essential that the European Union define a forestry strategy in order to improve the use and management of forestry resources
very fragile ecosystems
Forests occupy a privileged position in today's society
Over the last few years , we have seen the appearance of much development and exploitation of woodland areas
As regards protection , we must fight against erosion by preventing such forestry practices as clear felling
Methods for conserving genetic resources must be strengthened by encouraging seed selection and improvement
The fight to sustain plant health is still a priority among foresters
Greater attention must also be given to fire protection by encouraging prevention and detection
As regards forest use and exploitation , we should favour groups of small producers , advise owners about management and exploitation , and help with the mechanization of enterprises
The Commission should encourage the promotion of the timber industry
Wood is a renewable energy source
The Commission will also have to support the education of its citizens , especially the young
As for funding , the relationship between forests and cash is complex
In an economy obsessed with the short-term , with very stretched budgets , it is difficult to invest in production on a scale of centuries
Our forestry strategy should lay down firm guidelines which respect the subsidiarity principle
Europe must develop a voluntary policy supported by regular investment for both the protection and production of wood; a guarantee of long-term rural development
and species
Mr President , forestry policy ought first and foremost to be a national matter
Joint strategies ought to be restricted to issues of a general character
Each country must be given the opportunity to develop their own forestry policy
Swedish forests , the backbone of the Swedish economy , are used ecologically and with care for the environment
Any joint strategy chosen for the forestry industry should be based on producing a commercial forestry sector , run under market conditions , without subsidies which distort competition
There is a risk that the use of subsidies will perpetuate an ineffective structure and reduce both short and long term profitability
Certification of forests should serve as a means of communication between the producer and the consumer
This ought to form part of Community policy , like the quality mark
should rest with the Member States
It is also important that fresh ideas are not unfairly treated as a result of political decisions
A European campaign to promote the use of wood and wood products is being proposed
If such a campaign does take place it ought to include paper as well
Like wood products , paper products are also under pressure from substitutes such as plastic , glass and metals
It is preferable to link forestry issues with issues related to the forestry industry and not to agricultural policy
who wish ill on Europe's forestry industry , there is now a fate worse than more forest fires
This is a forestry policy similar to the European CAP
Mr President , this is why it is pleasing that the compromise proposal which is under consideration here is not aimed at such a development at all
countries of the Union in such a complicated area as this
Basically , there are very different conditions in the different regions and countries of the Union
In many countries , the forests are so neglected that extensive programmes are needed to rehabilitate them , whereas exactly the opposite is the case in Scandinavia
Here , there is no desire to further enlarge the forest , instead people are anxious to preserve the open landscape and the biological diversity that it represents
Because of this , the report is so general and so diluted that it barely gives any direction
It could serve only to complicate the issue for more substantive and practically national forestry policies
The report also has obvious difficulty in reconciling different views and opposing interests
On the one hand forest protection is highlighted , while on the other , the emphasis is placed , and indeed priority is placed , on better commercial use
How is this to be interpreted
put the surrounding area at risk
I think that the European Union ought not to take on further new , difficult and wide reaching tasks
It already has enough work coping with the tasks in hand
been very well thought out in the current budget situation
oil plants for example
to concentrate on finding the best way of managing the tasks which it has already accepted responsibility for
EU forestry policy
Despite this , I believe that some of those who have participated in this work do think that this is the case and view it as a step towards this
As a forest owner in Northern Sweden , I do not think that we need such a joint forestry policy
to these ideas in a joint forestry strategy
The tone of the report is set right from the first point where it states that commercial use of forests should be given priority in the EU's forestry strategy
This clearly shows what the report is aimed at
in Regulation 1610/89 , to the real needs of supporting the management and use of forests'
It is a question of 'use' and in the English original the word 'exploitation' is actually used
What this means in plain language is that EU support is to be used for the exploitation of forests
I think this is terrible
be acknowledged without unnecessary restriction on the economic use of the forest
still much discussed in Sweden
If this is passed we will be forced to rewrite this legislation and it will become totally and utterly useless
Commission to propose appropriate legislative measures to attain these objectives on bases and guidelines laid down by ourselves as parliamentarians
I would like to remind you that , from South to North , forests of all kinds cover a third of European Union territory
They are a vital element in future rural development in line with the European countryside charter that we have examined and voted upon in this very place
What are the problems with forests
obstacles to the establishment of a European forestry strategy
We should like these legal and technical points to be taken into consideration by the Intergovernmental Conference for inclusion in the future appropriately-amended Union Treaty
Next , the recent arrival of three new well-forested Member States , Austria , Sweden and Finland , has increased the mean forest area in the Union from 21 % to 34 %
even more with regard to the timber and wood pulp markets
with members of the Intergroup on Forestry
Although this new draft is satisfactory , some points still need clarification , and that is why I tabled a few additional amendments
To begin with , we emphasize the need for a reference to Article 130 of the Union Treaty which implies codecision and financial support from the Cohesion Fund
Secondly , in the second amendment , we point out that the coordination of forestry strategy with the other policies on the environment and rural development must actually be mentioned
Thirdly , it is stressed that the multi-functional role - socio-economic , environmental and recreational - must form the basis for long-term development of forests
Finally , in the last amendment , we call on the Commission to propose measures to guarantee economic development of forests linked to farming
in order to establish a genuine European forestry strategy capable of providing us with self-sufficiency in timber and other forestry products , as we have in food
Mr President , I wish to begin by complimenting my colleague , Mr Thomas , on the work he has done
This debate here today illustrates how difficult a task he has in trying to balance and bring together the competing philosophies on this subject
However , I would like to address two practical points to the Commission
as possible
I would like to ask the Commission to encourage practices and projects which seek to meet this objective
Similarly , as forests mature and technology advances , sometimes access to forests for harvesting can present quite a problem
budgets - certainly local authority budgets
I would therefore like to ask if the Commission would look favourably on encouraging Objective 5b funds to be used for this type of infrastructure
easily quantified in cold facts and figures
sustainable management
we can build on the existing pool of knowledge and practice
Mr President , fundamentally the Thomas report is a compromise between the different functions of what should be regarded as the European forest
Obviously this is not the text that some of us wanted , but I would say that it is broadly acceptable as amended during its progress through Parliament
I would like to emphasize the most important aspects of what a European forestry policy should be , as I understand it
there is no protection for anything that has no value
The protection of the forest is a need which is better fulfilled when it relates to a profitable asset
It is important that we develop this socio-economic potential
and economic players in each case are different too , as are the environmental characteristics of each European forest
To give an example , the Atlantic forest , which comes into the area I represent , is highly productive and 80 % privately owned by over two million individual proprietors
As a result it has enormous social repercussions , including , of course , on employment
But its characteristics are quite different from the Mediterranean forest , the Nordic forest and the central European forest
So we must respect this principle of subsidiarity and it must also extend to regional level
Sometimes we talk about subsidiarity in Europe as only extending to state level but there is no national forestry policy in Spain , for instance
be given legitimate scope in relation to the European Union in this sector
use of wood and its derivatives , a natural renewable material
I do not have time to go into this fully , but let me just give an outline
Community's consultative bodies
Of course much more can be done , but equilibrium between the environmental , socio-economic and recreational functions of the European forest can be promoted along these lines
And one final thought , Mr President
forests is for Europe one day to become self-sufficient in forestry resources
by colleagues in earlier speeches
report , but also has an impact on the environment and the countryside as a whole , with very different incidence across the European Union
northern European forest and the Mediterranean forest
addition to their environmental contribution
So I want to stress the variable importance of the forests as a function of their geographical zones
proposals are to prosper
Mr President , the Thomas report has taken a somewhat strange turn
After it was presented in the Committee on Agriculture some 200 to 220 amendments were tabled
After that there was a compromise to group these amendments or to withdraw some of them
What emerged from that is not much of an improvement
natural and sustainable development and to ensure that there would be no common market organisation similar to a common agriculture regulation for wood
In agriculture that has contributed considerably to the destructive developments
What we want instead is for the EU in a concentrated and limited fashion to secure a market immune to dumping from outside
where the value of wood is economically anchored
by the EU which were not of course given in other countries
wake
We need woods in general to survive
And that is why the EU must deal with this subject matter in an international context and not set up a regulation solely for within the EU
Mr President , the Swedish Social Democrats find it very difficult to support the Thomas report
This should not be seen as a criticism against the report itself but more a way of expressing our scepticism of a joint forestry strategy for the Union
We think that the principle of proximity should apply for this sector
We have enough problems within the Union adapting our agricultural and regional policies for enlargement towards the East
There is absolutely no reason for the Union to take upon itself another political area
As many speakers have pointed out , the problems vary enormously in the Countries of the Union
The Southern countries have too little forest while the Northern countries probably have too much
The Southern countries have problems with forest fires while in the North it is the cold that we struggle with
There is no lack of forestry policy either , the reverse is true
Individual countries have forestry laws and the necessary authorities to administer these laws
There is no lack of international cooperation either
All the European forestry authorities cooperate within the ECE Timber Commission
At a global level there is cooperation within the framework of the FAO
Trade problems are resolved within the framework of the WTO and so on
There is also extensive cooperation taking place to detail forest damage
Very detailed statistics are published annually for the sector
As for environmental certification , this is of dubious value for the Scandinavian countries
certification at a lower level than we have in Scandinavia
Adoption of common certification would lead , therefore , to a lowering of environmental standards for the Swedish forestry industry
Finally , Mr President I consider it unnecessary that the Union is using this document to recommend new increased expenditure
Our budget is already under considerable strain
Mr President , the last enlargement brought a deeper interest and even a passion into the debate on forestry in this Community
It is interesting to see the geographic interest and to recognize the diversity that enlargement has brought to thinking on afforestation in the Union
I thank Mr Thomas for his report
In some of the opinions annexed to the report there are entirely different descriptions of the industry at European level than the one he gives
I take it that his is the correct one , that we are about selfsufficient since the Nordic countries joined
Another report says we are only half self-sufficient so it a pity that students or even planners looking at documents like this see such contradictions within a few pages
That of course is not the fault of the rapporteur
We should not get ideologically fixed on the whole question of whether we have a common policy or not
We have a common industrial and commercial policy and we can have a common forestry policy in the same way
We will not have one like the common agricultural policy
I could not go as far as Graefe zu Baringdorf
Obviously , we would not want to have guaranteed prices and intervention and export refunds
is realistic to think that we ought to have a common policy so far as forestry is concerned
It need not necessarily impose a major burden on the European Union budget
I come from a country where we have the fewest forests in the European Union
The Finns harvest something in the order of 50 million cubic metres annually
The area under afforestation is the size of England and Scotland
In Ireland we have about 2 million acres or 16 % of our agricultural land and our worse land at that
So , there is a great diversity
of woodland
long run
We are planting 25 , 000 hectares annually at the moment
the entire production of sheep in Ireland at the moment
So , for us it is not only important for the environment but economically we can develop our forests into something very important
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , many farmers have the historic idea that very often they are farming land which used to be forest
In the south , we do not even have the notion of what forest is
Forest is really something very northern with all of those legends and stories
to have oak forests which no longer exist
Therefore - and I agree with what Mr McCartin said , everything pointed to the need for a common forestry policy
of what a forest is to us
For them , forest was always something apart and never really belonged to farming
For me , forest - because that is how I was brought up - is part of a farmer's income
in time , in my country I have already seen companies which want to move to Brazil in order to have abundant supplies of timber
Obviously it would be good for us to reach an agreement but it is definitely not the time and our amendments make this opinion quite clear concerning the Thomas report
Mr President , firstly , I would like to express my appreciation to rapporteur Thomas for the patient and constructive way that he has worked to produce this report
The forestry industry in Europe is very diverse with considerable variation in species between countries
This applies also to views on forestry policy
This is why such varied proposals have been put forward during the debate
Central Europe has long been demanding protection of our forests while the Southern States have long demanded a support system
This far reaching demand has now been dropped
This is a good thing , in my view , as it would involve problems both for the environment and for production in our forests
interests of the environment and of production
This policy means that the renewable raw material base is used while at the same time maintaining biological diversity
any State support
It is these differences between North and South , East and West which , on the whole , make a joint forestry policy inappropriate
Such a policy should not be introduced within the European Union
The document currently under consideration represents a compromise which we arrived at in the Agriculture Committee
For this reason , I think that we should accept it as it is without any of the amendments which have been put forward
Of course some important sections concerning both environmental and production issues , are missing , but the compromise is acceptable; we can live with it in Sweden
This is why I think that we shall be able to approve it here in Parliament when the time comes
Mr President , I must begin by greeting our new Vice-President , Mr Marinho , and congratulate him on being elected
The Thomas report has the great advantage of having aroused a wide-ranging debate on the subject of forests in the European Union
This debate has shown that unfortunately there is not a consensus about the place of forests in the framework of Community policy
The Thomas report merely proposes a common forestry strategy based on greater co-ordination of national policies and the strengthening of protection , training and information measures
deserves our greatest support for the effort which he has made to bring the different sides closer together
common forestry policy with express aims , the relevant application instruments and appropriate financial means
to the environment and the economy alike , since if people are not given incentives in economic terms to invest in the forest , then they will do nothing to defend it
annum , an equivalent to 0
8 % of the CAP budget
It is easy to conclude that what has now been proposed in the report presented to the European Parliament is derisory in terms of the European Union's resources
It is particularly derisory given the strategic importance of this sector for the future of our society
is nonsensical to set differences in the way in which agriculture and forestry are treated
First of all since the CAP reform in 1992 farming and forestry land are increasingly interchangeable in terms of market situation
Secondly because farmers tend to look upon forestry activities as a way of topping up their income earned from farming
However , just to refer to this situation is unacceptable
I am going to support this report but I hope that the Commission is going to be more daring in its proposals than the European Parliament Committee on Agriculture
Madam President , I should like to thank Mr Thomas for his report on a subject which is very important to us in Finland
for recreation
We should also not forget the spiritual values they possess , either
Finland is the only country in the world which is economically fairly dependent on forests
Finland's national wealth has been generated with the aid of forest-based production over the past 150 years
The annual growth of Finland's forests is now greater than ever before: more than 80 million cubic metres
annum
our national resources , our forests
decades in various parts of Finland
By means of them we are seeking to safeguard Finland's nature and the biodiversity of its forests
From these points of view , the report does not entirely come up to my hopes
The report stresses subsidies and regulations , whereas to my mind one should allow the market economy to resolve the issues at stake
Nor does the report take any account of the fact that , in Finland for example , most woodland belongs to small private proprietors
The report also recommends that consideration be given to setting up a European forestry school
I cannot support this idea , because in my opinion forestry education is already adequately organized within the territory of the Union , right up to university level
Nor can I endorse the view expressed in the report that there is a need to set up a Union forestry committee
I therefore consider that it should be adopted
Union's forestry resources - an interest that has shown itself again in this Chamber , given the number and quality of the contributions we have heard
Helsinki in June 1993
climate change and safeguarding biodiversity , all of them elements that have been taken up again in today's debate in the House
area of the Union has now doubled , the economic and political importance of the forestry sector has increased substantially within the Union
emphasis on specific issues
On the other hand , society in general is now using forests for an increasing variety of purposes and these require reasonable and sensible decisions
And it seems to the Commission that only multi-functional management of forests will allow as many as possible of those activities to co-exist within the same space
The Commission does , however , take the view that a degree of caution is needed , given that too general a discussion of forests could be misleading
to be suitably tailored
provocative statement , I venture to say that the European forest , in the singular , does not in fact exist: what we have are different aspects of a single issue
the level of the Union since 1988 , that is since the adoption of the forestry action programme
and the Commission believes that the principles and objectives set forth in Parliament's report offer a genuine framework consistent with the principle of subsidiarity
two years a framework document setting forth the main features of the sector and putting forward the strategy decisions that have to be based on that analysis
much aware of this - and will have to overcome many obstacles
I shall mention just two of them: first of all , the substantial differences in and heterogeneous nature of forest structures in both environmental and economic terms
different require not only understanding but also as much flexibility as possible on the part of the Member States at both a technical and a political level
There is a second major obstacle , namely the financial situation of the Union
a policy with no budget put into effect: miracles are always possible but I have not witnessed many
that it will be possible to make available in the immediate future substantial resources to fund investment in the forestry sector
In conclusion - given that that is the position - the Commission will have to take on a very difficult task
before it can draw up new forestry guidelines
this initiative
Thank you , Commissioner
The debate is closed
The vote will take place on 30 January in Brussels
EC/Israel public procurement and telcommunications agreements
concerning the conclusion of two agreements between the European Community and the State of Israel on procurement by government and telecommunications operators
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the two agreements to be debated today both concern specific types of contracts
More precisely , the first one concerns public contracts as covered by the Government Procurement Agreement , the GPA , concluded in 1996 in the context of the Uruguay Round
The second agreement concerns contracts for products and services supplied by telecommunication operators , in other words it concerns the market in telecommunications
I should point out that with this second agreement , the agreement on telecommunications contracts , the European Union and Israel have anticipated the outcome of the Uruguay Round
The GPA , after all , does not apply to telecommunications contracts
Hence the need for a specific agreement between ourselves and Israel
The two agreements together will ensure a good balance between both parties' interests
The agreement on telecommunications contracts is more beneficial to Israel , by ensuring that high-tech Israeli products can gain access to the Union's markets
Israel will of course benefit from this
The Union would appear at first sight to benefit more from the first agreement on public contracts as covered by the overall GPA
So what we have here is a carefully considered package which is advantageous to each party , I would venture to say each Member State of the European Union
These two agreements form a balanced whole which benefits both parties and to which there can be few objections on economic grounds
We know , of course , our relations with Israel are always rather special and are often subject to a whole raft of considerations which are more political in nature
My own view , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , is that liberalization of trade and of public contracts too can only prove beneficial in the longer term
If necessary we should try to extend these beneficial effects to the other countries in this troubled region , in order to encourage a degree of regional economic integration
Regional economic integration which one hopes will lead to an easing of political tensions
This seems to me far more sensible and far better than delaying , let alone preventing , reciprocal liberalization between the Union and Israel
A few more comments on procedural matters
The Committee on External Economic Relations decided to accept the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee and not to suggest changing the legal basis for the agreements
This with an eye to obtaining the assent , not just the opinion but the assent , of the European Parliament
view of the great confusion which exists about this at present
One final comment on the lack of transparency in this procedure
to them , especially since the annexes , the appended lists and the general notes to the Government Procurement Agreement have not as yet been published in the Official Journal
with the recommendation that the House give its endorsement to the conclusion of these two important agreements
me a chance to make four points
months to improve and develop relations between Europe and Israel
Europe-Israel association agreement approved here by a very large majority
new public infrastructures (a metro has been mentioned) , to call on European expertise
Both parties therefore benefit greatly from this , and we must recognize that this is not always the case in association agreements
I stress the importance of these agreements in the context of regional economic integration between Israel and its neighbours , in what we hope is the near future
Israel will then be a privileged intermediary for the European Union
the peace process
I myself , as you know , have always been confident , but I can understand the misgivings and doubts
I would therefore like to congratulate the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators on their courage and good sense
Europe has played a discreet but effective role , in particular with its special envoy whom we should also congratulate
first consequences
I am therefore pleased that we have been able to play a part here in these affairs during the last critical months
The future will be just as difficult and we must therefore still try and keep a cool head , and retain our common sense and sound appreciation of situations
practical and rapid effects on the economic and technological relations between Europe and Israel
Madam President , the conclusion of these two agreements is a further step towards achieving the European Union's goal of opening up the markets for public contracts further
And I think that is a very important and proper objective
welcome most warmly
I also have a point to make concerning procedure
to be treated properly
In this case the committee bowed to the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee
I think that is a wise decision , if only to preserve the unity of the European Parliament over this procedure
the European Union have been in very good hands in the Committee on external Economic Relations due to the fact that Mr De Clercq was the chairman of that committee
that Mr De Clercq will be serving the Union in a different capacity
and I regard it as an honour and as a very great pleasure to have served on his committee for the past two and a half years
years as chairman of the committee
This House talked long and hard about the European Union's Association Agreement with Israel
These two agreements on public procurement and telecommunications agreements are a consequence of it
Mr De Clercq looked rather more at the technical considerations , but I am looking at it more from the point of view of foreign policy , the Barcelona initiative
It is a step along the road to reciprocal liberalization , but it is also a step along the way towards stability in the region
The interests of the Union and Israel are well served too
Israel is strong in high-tech , and we need that in Europe
Europe has a sizeable head start in public transport
Israel has ambitious plans in this area , including the building of an urban metro line , and that would be a huge challenge to any one country of the Union
Of course the Union's economic resources are not the same as Israel's , but we are going through a good patch
thing , but the real issue is stability in the region
My Group , the Union for Europe Group , wholeheartedly endorses Mr De Clercq's report
public procurement
other procurement in the telecommunications sector specifically , it is clear that they represent a considerable step forward in opening up procurement at an international level
There is therefore a wider point here , above and beyond the purely technical matter of the two agreements
The Commission wishes to draw attention to a number of important points
sector , an area in which the Union is particularly competitive , and removes a number of exemptions previously negotiated under the Government Procurement Agreement
In addition , it opens up local procurement to European Union undertakings , in sectors other than those previously envisaged
that it was in fact accorded under the Government Procurement Agreement
which this initiative forms part has already been mentioned
Secondly , they make a real contribution to economic development and , therefore , also to the political stability of the region
Thirdly , they secure for the European Union more favourable treatment than Israel has hitherto accorded other third countries , by offering further economic opportunities to European suppliers
basis: this is a completely new element
Citizens' Rights had confirmed the legal basis proposed by the Commission
Affairs and Citizens' Rights for her contribution and , clearly , Mr de Clercq for having prepared the very clear and balanced report we are today debating
Thank you , Mrs Bonino

Consultation of workers
consultation (COM(95)0547 - C4-0538/95)
Madam President , Commissioner
May I point out that in addition to my five minutes as rapporteur I have a further three minutes on behalf of my group
The European Commission and Parliament have been trying to harmonise or coordinate company law for over twenty years
The debate on the legal form of the European company has recently been re-kindled
The so-called Ciampi report stipulates that the lack of a statute for the European company results in considerable costs for the European economy
In the light of the study by the group on stimulating competitiveness in Europe the Commission is urging a speedy adoption of the statutes , preferably in 1997
Five years ago the Commission presented proposals for a European cooperative society , a European mutual society and a European association , in other words not only for the European joint-stock company
agree on the essential directives on the position of employees
are part of social democracy
They mean economic productivity at the same time
way that all opportunities for sustainable development are fully utilised
The main objective of the communication we are debating here today is to break the deadlock on the proposals on the European company forms and European legislation
The Commission's communication concentrates on whether and how the directive on European works councils can help here
It offers three options: the first is keeping the status quo , the second and third options are closely linked
that the employee involvement directives would be withdrawn
The second option also proposes , in addition to the EWC Directive , a community instrument to create minimum standards for informing and consulting employees at the national level
I think this approach is important because it means that the European works council can operate more effectively
But this proposal does not constitute a contribution to economic co-determination
the EWC Directive is transposed
supervisory boards in Germany or the Netherlands or like those enjoyed in the Nordic countries of Finland and Sweden under collective agreement rights when company decisions are taken
It is with this in mind that my report calls secondly for opportunities for economic participation for employees
In view of the plethora of models in the European Union we must avoid two dangers
model
But equally worker co-determination cannot be circumvented by means of a European legal instrument
We must prevent the frequently quoted flight from co-determination
This must be counteracted by minimum standards in European companies
Any Community initiative is based on the assumption that the existing rules on co-determination are familiar
in the EU countries on information , consultation , participation and co-determination
It will also examine the role of the European works council under the general heading of codetermination
We hope that this group , which has already started work , will take the time to work out a definitive proposal
The results of this study must be presented for a social dialogue at the European level which can then decide on framework agreements on co-determination
Analogous agreements between both sides of industry might also be considered at the branch or company level
At all events we need a special yardstick for co-determination in all European joint-stock companies which corresponds to the relevant structures of the company or firm
The communication reports on why the directive on the EWC was so successful
That can be turned round any way one likes , the real secret of success of the EWC lies in certain procedural principles
They could also be very relevant in creating a co-determination model of a European joint-stock or other company
A European directive must lay down flexibility , negotiations solutions and minimum standards in the event that the social partners cannot reach agreement within a specific time
co-determination when employee numbers are low
That is not what the committee wants; we want to support these SMEs
participation
The European model is called social market economy and employee participation and partnership are part and parcel of its basic principles
Participation and co-determination are important principles
and Legal Affairs , whose opinions we fully endorse
Affairs and Citizens' Rights , whose point of view I am representing today
I have worked closely with both Mr Rothley and Mr Janssen van Raay on the issue of information and consultation of workers in the European Company Statute
The conclusions of the Legal Affairs Committee were very largely similar to the conclusions of Mr Menrad
the wellbeing of the internal market that we have information and consultation of workers in some form
Speaking particularly about the European Company Statute , this is an important plank of the internal market and it is absolutely vital that the Commission gets this proposal unblocked
We need a European Company Statute with the full participation of the workforce
It is quite unacceptable to press ahead with a company statute without British workers being fully involved
Indeed , back in Britain many British companies tell me they want the European Company Statute
It is a voluntary arrangement; it is not compulsory
European Company Statute with Britain a kind of second-class citizen again
As far as European Works Councils are concerned , they have some place
But if we look at the Commission's consultative document , it muddles up the options for information , consultation and participation
We need to build on the best traditions of company law in the whole of Europe
Germany has a fine tradition of workers on the board , France and other places have good versions too
We need to have a flexible system which is good for all the workers in Europe
outcome to the IGC
On behalf of the Group I compliment Mr Menrad most warmly on his report
It is a good report , ladies and gentlemen , and it contains a very powerful New Year message , Commissioner , to the European Commission
In the view of my Group that message is as follows
As Mrs Oddy said just now , we are all agreed on the need for progress on the various forms of European company , which have been blocked for years now
But on one thing we must be clear
We are not prepared either to make social concessions to the single market
for us that can only be possible if we also get definitive rules , not only on worker information and consultation , but also on worker participation
notice to the Commission that we , the European Parliament , will not yield on the matter of these rules for worker participation
Already during the debate on the 1995-1996 social action programme Parliament pressed in Mr Hughes' report for all directives concerning worker participation which were currently blocked to be unblocked
We were very glad to see the Commission producing a communication for the benefit of the social partners
Well , Commissioner , I have to say with regret on behalf of my Group that we are somewhat disappointed in the Commission's communication
exist in the Member States
We also think that the concrete options suggested in this statement are not satisfactory
Indeed we think that the European works council is a success
We are very happy that even firms in countries not bound by these rules have chosen to have European works councils
But we also think that worker involvement should not stop at the European works council
In smaller firms too there must be provision for information , consultation and participation
The Union must ensure that social dialogue is and remains an essential element in our European social model
Secondly , the issue of participation is not regulated either in the European works council or in the directive on collective redundancies or transfers of undertakings
And that is a subject which has been under discussion since the Vredeling directive
they can avoid trade union involvement in their operations
So , Commissioner , it is unacceptable to us that there should be a European company in a country which will not even agree to works councils
So the United Kingdom cannot be involved for the moment
But secondly , we also find it unacceptable to have a European company without far-reaching rules on participation
the Member States
the contrary to enable dialogue to exist within small businesses too
I shall thus be happy to support the EPP Group's Amendment No 2 on behalf of my own Group
Thirdly , legislation which leaves the specific shape and form of things to the social partners
Fourthly , which provides for minimum rules applicable to everyone
I think this will give us a piece of good legislation , Commissioner
Mr Menrad too has made an exceptional contribution in the drafting and presentation of his report
Because this is no simple matter; it concerns the very essence of codetermination in the various countries of Europe and thus the essence of the European social system
Our subject is of course the European company and the Commission is now trying to get this European company off the ground
For two reasons it has not yet managed to do so - firstly the question of codetermination and secondly the question of tax
We are very much in favour of it
But the machinery of codetermination is not suitably regulated and that is not good enough
them
It is not easy
It is not easy from the standpoint of a country like Germany , or one like the Netherlands , and certainly not from the standpoint of a country like Italy
The merit of this opinion is that it has drawn all the threads together
We have started along the road , we are going to resolve the problem and maybe finally get this European company sorted out
That is I think a very important point
But countries which do not have codetermination councils , European works councils , cannot really be a part of this
That is one thing
forms for them
They must be flexible forms but forms of equal value
Forms which are equal and thus do not lead to an erosion of codetermination but on the contrary to an enhancement of the European model
So , Commissioner , the European works council has made a significant contribution towards the further resolution of this problem
But it is also important that we should continue our efforts , as the opinion advocates , on codetermination in general
It is a slow process but it must be addressed
All these things taken together more or less boil down to what Mr Menrad proposes
Mr Menrad also stresses the importance , and rightly , of the expert committee headed by Mr Davignon
I am actually very glad we have produced this opinion before his committee has started work
I think they will find the opinion useful
The European People's Party attaches enormous importance to a European company
It is crazy that we have a European market but as yet no European company
This company has to be voluntary , but it must offer a basis for codetermination
have not yet advanced quite so far along the road
I think Mr Menrad has made a good job of presenting the overall situation
I hope the Commission will take all the recommendations on board , because each one is important in its own way
of Mr Menrad's
Madam President , as we are all aware , the main objective of the report on the consultation of workers is to establish appropriate and up-to-date global rules governing the sector
be retained without change
But let us look more closely at the other two
As a group , we are in favour of the third option provided it does not depend on implementation of the second option
We need therefore to unhook the third from the second option which suggests a global approach based on the definition of a general framework
on European Works Councils
individual state
In certain sectors , the adoption of Community rules of a general nature could therefore prejudice balances achieved with great difficulty over a period of time
The third option therefore seems to us to be based on realistic demands reflecting clearly-defined requirements
required under Directive 94/45 for other companies at a Community level
We have the opportunity of taking an approach which meets the needs of both workers and undertakings
And it is our duty to do so
my Group that we were very happy to be discussing Mr Menrad's report
We found many excellent points in it and we compliment him
business and industry a lot of money
on competing with the United States and Japan
It is amazing really that we have not managed to agree on a company statute of this kind and I have a question to ask here
which want to have control over national competition here too and which are also worried about the fiscal consequences
issue of worker consultation and participation
in an effort to find locations with the most favourable conditions for them
terms of employment and workers' rights
world
So I think the Commission faces a major challenge here , and not just the Commission alone , but our colleagues too , and I shall be addressing it energetically myself
this dossier
in the Council with a view to giving this dossier an extra push
So , ladies and gentlemen , I suggest we all pledge our commitment to that
Madam President , I am going to use my time to read a text by Mr Ribeiro who cannot , unfortunately , be present
factors is one of the most interesting we can discuss
Either in terms of ideology or in terms of the practical and political expressions which might be used
or have the only authority on the matter
However , for those people perhaps nothing is of interest and not even in terms of thought or action
The Menrad report , in my opinion , reflects the complexity of this question in dealing with information and consulting workers
However , it is not innocuous and would be dangerous to identify information and consultation with participation
The report does not make clear this vital distinction and nor does it avoid the risks of that possible identification
To inform and to consult might become the antidote for real participation or an excuse for avoiding real participation at all
and consultation are not necessary for doing business
I accept and support the claim of the principle of informing and consulting workers
accept real measures taken against them during difficult economic times , dismantling systems and reversing social games
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen
Mr Pronk talked about the European social model and the European system
I think we must look at that a little more critically
We are not here to limit ourselves to defending the status quo
It is true that there is no change without defence , defence against the neo-liberal attempts to seize territory
But it is equally true that attack is the best form of defence
We have the opportunity to design the European constitution as one of the basic levels for coordinating the Europeanisation and democratisation of the economy
That may sound presumptuous , too aggressive for some , too optimistic for others
at the broader level
That is going too far
process
But once the reverse force is under way we have no reason to bring it to a halt at the structure stage where it stopped in our national histories
We should ensure that we really make further progress along the lines of democratising the economy
If the people who propelled this neo-liberal dynamic force then start to complain , they only have themselves to blame
him that I find some parts of his report a little obscure
Of course , there were difficulties in translation
And of course I handle social concepts with less facility than he does
it becomes less well-defined
Apart from that , it would be advisable for the rapporteur to explain clearly what he means by 'co-determination'
I fear that term does not cover the same situation in France and Germany
Let me now turn to a fundamental point
The rapporteur assigns trade unions a leading role in the life of firms
As you know , trade union history is in large measure that of a struggle between two ideas illuminated by different doctrines
trade union pluralism enabling workers to form any unions they wish and to join the organization of their choice
established organizations which cling fiercely to those privileges
with slightly divergent economic doctrines
and it is only when there is a shortfall at the first round that the worker can vote or stand for an organization of his choice not yet recognized
Note that the French criteria for representativeness always include the patriotism shown during the years of occupation
It is difficult to see how organizations whose founders have not yet reached retirement age could satisfy this criterion
face the German army
and better controlled
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen
The European join-stock company may well facilitate the change towards the internal market if one considers the ever closer economic interrelationship of companies in Europe
to produce an over-hasty conclusion
labour force , works councils and trades unions
We could , of course , have shown greater courage for co-determination and not for reduced participation , precisely because we were not under pressure of time
it would have been a signal to the labour force that Europe also values more than just shareholders
If you will bear with me , Mr Menrad , I cannot refrain from pointing out a few inconsistencies
In paragraph 11 I am happy to see that you say there must be no flight from co-determination
example , is the law on small companies dealing with co-determination rights in companies with fewer than 500 employees
That is why I am particularly worried about paragraph 14 of your report in which you made specific reference to this matter
We all know that most workers in Europe are employed in these small and medium-sized companies and I think that they are the ones who need special protection
And as you also know , Germany has also made works council rights worse for very small firms , for those with fewer than ten employees
In principle we welcome the study which you referred to in supportive terms
But we do expect that the results will not only be made available to representatives of the social dialogue but also of course to the European Parliament
I believe we should discuss our ideas on a future European directive and European company statute in detail and without pressure of time
I urge that we keep national traditions but at the same time advance democracy in the world of work at the European level
We are unfortunately still far removed from that objective on the threshold of the next century
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen
First of all I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Menrad , very warmly
He has brought his wide experience , his deep knowledge , his perspicacity and attention to detail to this report
not the Commission's fault
in the Council
That is particularly true of the co-determination model
exactly where matters have become stuck: not in the European Parliament , not in the Commission but in the Council
The Commission's four principles for solving this problem sound good: to wit , simplification , coherence , pragmatic and planned progress and general application
European mutual society - I am doubtful , Commissioner
to see the Commission's definitive document on the table before us
and consulting employees
The Commission's group of experts , as I have unfortunately had occasion to say to you , Commissioner , is composed of theoreticians and too few practitioners
I also think the deadlines set for this expert group on such a complex subject are too tight
Here I agree with Mr Menrad
I fully endorse the broad conclusions which the rapporteur has already reiterated
I would just like to draw attention to a sentence where he writes: variant 3(a) would be most acceptable in combination with option 2
inexistent community instrument to regulate information and consultation at the national level
other is an asset for all concerned
on European companies
to , and consultation , with employees
It is very important that this does involve a minimum of regulations and not a full harmonisation of legislation
Each Member State must be able to maintain and develop its own regulations which may be more far reaching than the framework and the minimum requirements
There are also large discrepancies between Member States
In Sweden there is already a well developed system of participation through collective agreements which has proved to work well
Above all , issues of this nature ought to be resolved and administered by the labour market and related parties
Any proposals for legislation and directives ought therefore to be developed in close conjunction with the relevant parties in the labour market
This proposal , Mr President , should be seen as a first step towards more far reaching employee influence at EU level as well
Mr President , Commissioner
perhaps note should be taken of the paradox that a communication on worker participation , consultation and information has been produced without consulting the social partners
To me that is a paradox
the statutes of companies , associations , cooperatives and mutual societies that have to do with worker information , consultation and participation
on the social issues we are so concerned about , at least in our group
approving anything to do with workers' rights and citizens' rights in general
all
Because , we repeat , the Europe some of us want will not exist if worker and citizen participation is not turned into reality
Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Menrad on his splendid report
It is great to have a German Conservative I can agree with , even if I cannot agree with my British Conservative colleagues
It is nice to see someone like him involved in dealing with the social area so that real progress can be made in this Parliament
Unfortunately , we do not get that kind of progress inside the Council of Ministers and I know very well why that is so
company for workers
It is further right that this report identifies the fact that we need to promote this progress both positively and earnestly
The Directive on European Works Councils after all is rather too limiting for any progress to be made
I must say to Mrs Van Lancker that the social debate in the United Kingdom is not entirely dead
I was the editor of a pamphlet in the '80s which spoke about the pan-European agreements that were being forged vis-√†-vis the participatory democratic relationships inside companies
I was very pleased then that companies in the United Kingdom had taken a very positive lead in that
But , unfortunately , the United Kingdom , as you know , is controlled by what we might refer to as the political undead
I hope that one day we will be able to do without them
I know that you will join me when we try to do something about that
This report clearly demonstrates that conflict can be avoided inside companies
Seoul in Korea to see just how trade union rights are being taken away from workers with the horrendous violence which is being seen on the streets there
It is quite obvious that this is some proof of what we can do
this is all essential if we are to have the kind of success which we know is relevant for the progress of this report
we can promote this through the Commission and the Council as rapidly as possible so that it becomes law
and for that reason , if you will , from another standpoint , we note developments at the European level with particular interest
Here , of course , we should express threefold concern , as I believe has been confirmed by other speakers too
rights , and that is why we have been bogged down for decades over the issues of information , participation and consultation
that already exist in other European Union countries
The third concern is that we may end up with laws so labyrinthine , fragmented and technical , that working people will ultimately be largely excluded
range of the labour and unionist movement's monitoring capabilities
of Experts , a directive characterized by flexibility and a high-level common denominator , are extremely important
Mr President , this report highlights the need to make progress on working out a participation model in the question of informing and consulting employees in the co-determination process
Flexibility , pragmatic negotiation solutions and the introduction of necessary minimum standards will play a major role in this in view of the present very different European systems
than ever
Today's international economy shows ruthlessly how capital moves and is concentrated , how it vanishes , what it exploits and who becomes the pawn of this new flexibility
The biggest problem here is that in these international processes , in these international mechanisms basic human and trade union rights are circumvented and infringed
In this context we must also think beyond the frontiers of Europe
We must do that in order to see more clearly
I know full well that we cannot regulate everything , nor indeed try to do so
that that the plurality of our society and the creation of our democratic system depends
costs on the economic side
That is something we must constantly bear in mind
a statute could also provide the incentive for investments and so employment
the necessary impetus for action
Here it is important that the European solution adopted does not allow any escape for any company from countries with stricter regulations
Otherwise we would only need to start talking about de-regulation downwards and that surely cannot be the credo of our action
in this matter
A refusal to have co-determination is the most expensive wrong investment for the economy
That is something we must never forget
information and consultation
careful attention you have all paid to this very important subject
This applies especially to Mr Menrad who has made quite a decisive contribution to the settlement of some previous dossiers , such as the European Works Councils
We all want to acknowledge that
matter
As Mr Menrad emphasizes in his report , the Commission communication addresses two main subjects
The first is the need for a Community level framework for information and consultation in national undertakings
in the fulfilment of the internal market
Regarding the first issue , I very much welcome the positive approach which you have adopted
for the consultation of the social partners at European level
on how these rules will be put in place
a quarter of a century
single market conditions and to become more competitive worldwide
The imminence of the third phase of economic and monetary union now reinforces the urgent need to make this instrument available
last June at its meeting in Florence
in individual Member States
Today I am pleased to say this represents common ground but you have not restricted yourselves to merely restating this basic position
Mr Menrad's paper goes much further and analyses in depth a number of ways in which this approach could be put into effect
You have put forward many innovative ideas which will be of very great help to us in trying to find a way out of the present difficulties
There are many difficulties to be overcome as has been stated by many of the contributors to the debate
As you know , the Commission has recently established a high level group of independent experts chaired by Mr Davignon
This expert group is an additional forum for reflection and will be an extra source of ideas on this issue
I understand that there will be a delegation from the European Parliament including Mr Menrad which will be meeting the members of this group in the very near future
I urge you to discuss your ideas , which are articulated in the report , with the expert group
I am sure it will be very useful and an important input to their work
to you on behalf of the Commission and to the other Community institutions
My aim is to have concrete solutions capable of gathering the support required for the conclusion of this long-standing debate
Ms Oddy put it very well when she said that Europe needs the European company
It is a very important matter for the perfection of the internal market
I agree
Mr Pronk recognized very clearly that there are many different systems in existence throughout the Community and it will not be easy to bring them all together
the confidence both of business and commerce and also respect the need for appropriate involvement of workers
The European company has always been necessary for the internal market
With the advent of EMU and the single currency , it will not just be necessary but essential
more appropriate to put our ideas up front first rather than consult people in advance of putting the consultation document into play
There will be very wide consultation as a consequence of all we have now done
Finally , we have been trying to achieve this for twenty-six years
having such an instrument
After all these years we are now arriving at the possibility of a solution which has evaded the Union for so many years
solution here as well
After all those years I remain optimistic
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a

Protection of forests
The next item is the report (A4-0417/96) by Mr Collins , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , on the proposals for Council Regulations amending:
I
Regulation (EEC) No 3528/86 on the protection of the Community's forests against atmospheric pollution (COM(96)0341 - C4-0476/96-96/0185(CNS)); II
Regulation (EEC) No 2158/92 on protection of the Community's forests against fire (COM(96)0341 - C40477/96-96/0186(CNS))
Mr President , I was relying on the Commissioner making a long speech
Usually you can rely on these things , but the very time I wanted him to make a long speech , he cut it short
It is quite terrible
I shall send you a message in future: ' Do not worry , make a long speech' , I shall say
I apologise for my absence , but the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection was being reconstituted
Now that it is reconstituted I can tell you about this report
In fact , it is completely uncontroversial
The committee has examined the Commission's two proposals: one , on the protection of forests against atmospheric pollution and the other on forest fires
We have looked at these and think that they are laudable
They are contributions to sustainable forestry
They build on existing programmes and simply bring them up-to-date
They extend the life of the programmes and make the necessary budgetary changes
We had one problem with the Commission and that was the way in which it presented the budgetary provisions
The Commission wanted to include the budgetary provisions in the proposals
That is contrary to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 1995 and so , on examining the two proposals the Budget Committee made some amendments
open and , I hesitate to say above-board , but at least transparent
The Budget Committee also pointed out that we need to have mid-term assessment of cost-effectiveness and implementation performance
Again , the Environment Committee thought that that was a wise suggestion
We are therefore prepared to recommend acceptance of the Budget Committee amendments
When we voted I recommended the inclusion of these amendments and the committee has followed that advice
We think , as a committee , that these reports will make a very large difference to European Union forestry policy and they will continue existing , successful programmes
They have cross-party and inter-committee support
Therefore I , like the Commissioner before me , do not need to make a very long speech
I can finish at this point because nobody has sent me a message to ask me to speak any longer
I recommend that Parliament accept these reports
retabled in 1992 - which we are now updating for a further five years
of experiment and commitment
of scientific research , giving it priority over monitoring and cataloguing , the procedures and criteria for which ought , in our view , to be firmly established ten years on
The issue of protection against fire is a different and more complex one
there were many more
All of them are caused , one way or another , by man
bordering on forest , with unmown grassland resulting in a lethal deposit of highly-flammable hay; the third - and perhaps the most - critical cause is crime
the financial incentives provided for extinguishing fires and for reafforestation
any proposals - what we need then are initiatives able to identify those proposals that are objectively valid
Finally , the resources are very limited: ECU 70 m for fighting fires
That is very little if we really want to make more progress
Mr President , the report by Mr Thomas debated this evening states that the forests have deteriorated by 3
8 % compared with the previous year
So that adds another 3
8 % to the 27 % of European trees that were already in trouble
Hence the need to approve these regulations and the funds to help implement them , expressed by the chairman of the Committee on the Environment
As he said , there was no great problem approving this report on the regulations and funds
clear , and the Committee on the Environment tried to achieve that on several occasions
between the various countries and the European Union , to achieve a common policy to protect our forests
Otherwise it will not be possible to implement the 'Habitats' directive properly by the year 2000
Mr President , atmospheric pollution is no respecter of national boundaries , that much is obvious
The problems of Scandinavia's forests are a clear demonstration of the fact
I thus think that European cofinancing of research into the quality of the forests is a good thing
The regulation we are looking at here has been several years in the making and the results of the research are gradually becoming known
I have been looking through the findings published in the summary report of 1996
One of the thing which struck me was that the data show that it is excessive dryness , rather than air pollution , which damages the forests
And then we are talking about a specific region , the region around the Mediterranean
That is a remarkable finding
But it does not mean that air pollution does not play a part too
A quarter of trees were found to have lost a considerable proportion of their needles or leaves
So the research has so far yielded all this and it would seem a good idea to extend it
Now most of the money is already going not into observation via the systematic network , but into model and demonstration projects
I can understand that shift , though I do think we should consider reducing the level of European support once the new five-year period is up
in fact been achieved
It would seem that five years of research will yield enough data to enable conclusions to be drawn
to counter air pollution and its effects on the soils and measures to counter desiccation
order to secure the flow of funding
In my view this applies even more to the regulation on forest fires
To conclude , Mr President , I am happy to support most of the amendments
programmes in their dual role of prevention of atmospheric contamination and protection against fire
These programmes can be generally felt to have been effective and Community coordination and evaluation of these two general phenomena continue to be necessary
But questions need to be put to the Commission , and some suggestions may also be in order
territory of the European Union and according to Commission reports , now operational - and an intensive monitoring network
The Commission has also presented us with data on over 200 pilot schemes developed , approved and financed
the damage being observed in the forests
for evaluating and establishing cause and effect and , above all , procedures for looking after forests and forest floors
The Commission should be asked to deepen this evaluation and , if new research programmes are needed , they must be carried out
We cannot go on observing the deterioration of the forests , providing statistics and taking no measures
and France and , in part , Germany too
Europe
This really does not make sense and there are no supernatural causes
The phenomenon clearly involves criminal acts and negligence by the authorities , because an additional statistic is that 50 % of the causes of these fires remain unknown
Member States should be told that if they want to go on receiving Community aid , they must intensify their vigilance and especially their research
And , in the southern countries , the Member States must give local communities and councils greater responsibility for protecting the forests around them
I think that is an essential tool of effective protection
Mr President , I too agree with the furtherance of this extension of programmes related to the protection of forests from atmospheric pollution and fires
This is certainly a positive action by the Commission , and I agree with all that the rapporteur Mr Collins said
from that point of view , nobody can absolve the administrations of the Member States from blame
the control of fires
is still open and requires much greater readiness to intervene and to support the European Union's action
debate on these important matters
However , we have to recognize that the sums provided for funding these five-year programmes are very small
was not increased
The number of fires in Europe is tending to increase considerably
That in itself would justify an increase in the modest grant of ECU 70 million over five years , i
e
ECU 14 million per annum , particularly as it would be funding preventive measures
much smaller
Moreover , providing funds for prevention reduces by as much the considerable cost of reafforestation
An appreciable saving is made in this way
from ECU 70 million to ECU 100 million which is still an eminently reasonable sum since , over five years , it amounts to ECU 20 million per year
So on behalf of my group , I ask you , Mr Rapporteur , to be willing to accept this amendment
I ask Parliament to adopt it and the Commission to take it over
Mr President , today Parliament has been giving very serious attention to the problems of our forests , which cover 41
5 % of the agricultural land of Member States , two thirds of which are happily private property
by European forests in the environmental , health and leisure fields but also in social and economic areas
A good European Union forestry policy must not ignore the spirit of principle of subsidiarity: as little Community regulation as possible , limited to what is necessary
Using European resources to protect forests against atmospheric pollution that ignores frontiers and protecting Community forests against fires are Community activities that are worth strengthening and continuing
It is therefore important that we are given the resources for this policy , particularly as regards the protection of forests against fires
funding set aside for implementing the necessary action
this point
and wild life habitats , a part that is too often misunderstood in some sections of this Parliament
Hunters' organizations must also be full partners in the implementation of Community measures designed to protect our forests
So do not forget them , Commissioner
hidebound and inclined to inflict damage on itself
Not even the Commission has been able to reverse this trend and secure a real understanding of the need to protect the environment and the health of citizens
It revealed its own limitations when it failed to propose adequate financial support
In point of fact , this is totally inadequate compared with the problem of safeguarding forests and preventing the fires which play so great a part in their destruction
of human stupidity
fires have resulted in the destruction of more than 500 , 000 hectares of forest
been practically exhausted , it is clear just how inadequate that funding is
other , for the Member States to submit global fire protection programmes
The latter must not be general , that is not particularly detailed , programmes; they must be specific and as clear as possible
Council and strengthen the role of the European Parliament
First of all I should like to express the Commission's thanks to you , Mr Collins , rapporteur , and the Members of your committee for the quality of their work
I would also like to stress the importance of the analysis in the reports from the Budget and Agricultural Committees and their respective rapporteurs also
They have all taken a very positive stance on the protection of the Union's forestry resources and the continuation of the Community measures in that sector
It is very clear both from the Thomas report this morning and this afternoon that the protection and maintenance of forests is an extremely important topic
It is widely debated throughout the world , particularly in view of the significant role of forests in combating desertification , climate changes and in the preservation of biodiversity
By signing the Rio Declaration , the Union formally undertook to help in the conservation , development and sustainable management of forests , whether in its own territory or elsewhere
The Sustainable Development Commission , with its governmental panel on forests , and the Helsinki Conference of Ministers on the protection of forests in Europe are the result of that undertaking
The two forest protection measures referred to by Mr Collins that we are now proposing to extend are the key elements in the conservation of Europe's forests
Their importance is underlined by the fact that about a quarter of our forests are showing reduced vitality and half-a-million hectares are devastated by fire each particular year
been ten days without a forest fire , with 95 % of all the forest fires taken care of and controlled within ten minutes of starting
A lot of good work has been done there
We should recognize that
You have all expressed your broad agreement with the extension and the strengthening of these two important measures
For that I want to thank you
I also understand that you have proposed a number of amendments
Several of these are common to both regulations
the case
But nonetheless the Commission considers that Article 43 is both appropriate and sufficient and is not disposed to amend the legal base at this time
Nos 2 , 3 , 4 , 7 , 10 , 12 , 13 and 16
This is , in particular , what Mr Collins referred to
We had quite mistakenly failed to take account of that change
This omission was also pointed out by the Council's working parties
Parliament , the Council and the Commission
The amendments that you have requested in the committee procedure - Amendments Nos 5 , 6 , 14 and 15 - refer primarily to the publication of discussions within committees
As you will know , this matter has since been settled by agreement between Parliament and the Commission and redrafting of the legal texts is not longer required
You then ask for the Standing Forestry Committee to be changed into an advisory committee
But in practice the committee already acts in an advisory role in most cases
So I do not think that such a change should be part of this simple extension which is being sought today
forest health status and details on forest fires
The Commission will ensure that these reports are made available to the honourable Members by means of a more appropriate information process
The atmospheric pollution matter was referred to in four amendments , that is , Amendments Nos 22 , 25 , 26 and 28
They are of particular interest
However , we should remember that this is simply an extension of an action whose systems are already established at national , Community and international levels
So it is difficult therefore for the Commission to agree to those requests at this present time
fires and also to provide for the financing of insurance for that replanting
These are measures which are not directly linked to the action and they would , I suggest , be very cumbersome
In addition , some experts have stated that they would not always be desirable or technically feasible
were particularly mentioned by Mr de Br√©mond d'Ars
We would like that to happen also
Unfortunately I am afraid such an increase does not appear a realistic proposition at this time given the current budgetary situation
Lastly , the Commission would like to welcome the amendments concerning the vital role of the rural population in the prevention of forest fires
Perhaps this refers to what Mrs Lulling was saying as well: Amendments Nos 11 and 21
This is a subject that we take very seriously
Within the Standing Forestry Committee we are cooperating closely with professional agricultural and forestry bodies to study the causes of fires and improve the protection measures generally
Accordingly we accept these amendments with some pleasure
I would once more like to thank the rapporteurs
of forest resources generally , which we will be passing on to future generations
The debate is closed
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9

Application of customs and agricultural law
customs and agricultural matters (COM(93)0350 and COM(94)34-4324/95 - C4-0212/95-00/0450(COD))
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen
The proposal for a regulation on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities in customs and agricultural matters has already trod a long and weary path
Unfortunately there is not yet any sign of a speedy solution
The conflict with the Council on the legal base to be applied has not been resolved
May I briefly remind you of the background
assistance between the administrative authorities and the creation of a customs information system , CIS for short
Thereupon the Commission presented an amended proposal which incorporated most of Parliament amendments
replaced it with Article 235 together with Article 43
State
This unilateral behaviour is unacceptable to us
Parliament now has formally to adopt an opinion on two questions
Firstly: is Article 235 justified as a legal base
Secondly: is the legal base significant only in procedural terms or also in substantive terms
harmonisation of individual national legislation for the internal market provided for by Article 100a
under Article 235
There were informal talks here with the rapporteur
environment allowing mutual assistance to be activated and to operate in relations between the Member States and with the Commission
This is clearly confirmed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Civil Liberties in its excellent opinion
I am very grateful to Mrs Palacio , who drafted the opinion , for stressing that in her accompanying opinion
As both national and community norms are mainly involved , this is undoubted harmonisation and therefore subject to Article 100a
in the Council , Article 43 - consultation of Parliament and qualified majority in the Council , Article 100a co-decision of Parliament and qualified majority in the Council
Furthermore the ruling states that the procedure which can strengthen Parliament's participation in legislation takes precedence
That brings us back again to Article 100a
Incidentally it is not only the legal service of the Commission but also that of the Council that confirms the correctness of Article 100a
On question 2 , the substantive significance of the legal base
The Council accepts five amendments from Parliament , either verbatim or in essence , in its political stance
But other basic amendments made by the Commission in its modified proposal were ignored by the Council
Instead the Council said that information may only be passed on between administrative authorities once individual authorization has been granted by the judicial authorities
That can mean delay or even obstruction
In addition essential data in the CIS is omitted
This is of particular importance for transit traffic which we are dealing with in the sub-committee; the results of this should be available soon
The Council plans to exclude mutual assistance not only in restrictions of public order but also in other basic interests of the Member States
That is , excuse me , an elastic clause
The Council has also made many amendments to the Commission's text
It questions the equal value of findings by an authority in another Member State
In Article 43 the advisory committee is replaced by a type 3B regulatory committee
What inconsistency the Council is guilty of
On the one hand there should be an integral community entity under Article 235 , on the other hand it should be subjected to cumbersome national procedures
Four countries , namely Denmark , Ireland , the United Kingdom and Sweden want to opt out from the regulation on non-automatic data processing
In other words , √† la carte
I conclude that on the matter of substance the proposal for a regulation also calls for co-decision , especially after the textual amendments made by the Council
I specifically ask the Commission - and I know , Commissioner Bonino , that you will take a view now - to clarify the statement that you , i
e
legal means , and I ask which means
Thank you for your attention and I urge the House to approve the motion for a resolution
Mr President , I am very pleased that at least the Council is present
Behind the legal cloak of an issue concerning Articles 235 and 100a , the real issue is of high political significance
It is the clear indication of a lack of political will by the Council of Ministers to have the heart of a Community structure function properly
We are just about to adopt a report from the committee of inquiry into the Community transit system
That committee of inquiry came to the conclusion that what is at the heart of our common internal tariff is fraud-prone and error-prone
There is a lack of statistics and a lack of clarity in the application of the common customs tariff
This Community structure is a scandal
What is the Council's reply to this
The Council's reply is to invoke spurious legal arguments to maintain the semblance of national sovereignty rather than having a strong internal market structured to apply the system
Because that is basically what we want: we want to have good cooperation between the Member States so that the common customs tariff functions
What is the Council's reply
and thereby to contribute to the undoing of the internal market
I hold the Council responsible for a lack of political will to have the system function properly
That is what is behind this whole issue
Mrs Theato very clearly indicated that , of course , there is also the question of the institutional balance between Parliament and the Council
power of Parliament
The titanium dioxide case makes it abundantly clear that Parliament has its rights
That is the political heart of the matter
it now stands to function
is difficult to be in several places at once
of the best reports ever produced by Mrs Theato
But let me make one thing clear: we must sort out the fraudsters in the EU
There are many reasons why public opinion in Europe is not always favourable towards the Union
One of them is the stories about how easy it is to commit fraud with the Union's money
To put it another way , one justification for European cooperation can be a continuing fight against fraud
Another reason for the limited public backing for the EU is of course the ideas about closed doors and the self-perpetuating talk from men in suits
To put it another way , a further justification for European cooperation is increased democracy and openness in the Union's decision-making process
It should be obvious that this situation has to be taken into account and respected , for example when establishing the legal basis in a specific matter
But let me make a second thing clear
They have once more been day-dreaming in the Council
We should use Article 235 as little as possible
Firstly , because an objective approach in a specific matter should involve the use of Article 100a , not Article 235
Secondly , because we wish to have democracy , and openness in the decision-making process
openness and from the principle of being closer to its citizens
have to take account of it
I can therefore only support and commend to the House this valuable piece of work by the rapporteur
more interest in what is happening in the Committee on Budgetary Control
I would expect us not just to have special occasions when the Council goes there once in a while by mistake and sees what is happening in the committee
The Dutch presidency should listen and take note
Then it may start to appreciate what is involved here , and perhaps we can do some work for the European project among the individual members of the Community
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission , like Parliament , has divided feelings about the situation created by the change in legal basis envisaged by the Council
Firstly , it is undeniable that the fight against fraud demands that this proposal for a regulation be quickly brought into force
urgent necessity
the Commission
As you know , when the common guidelines were adopted , the Commission insisted that a statement regretting this development be recorded in the Council minutes
I quote: ' the Commission reserves the right to make use of any legal means open to it'
Of course , the Council acting unanimously really does have the right to modify proposals from the Commission
That is not being called into question
codecision procedure , the Council is infringing the powers of Parliament
Consequently , the Commission awaits with great interest the reaction of the Council to the opinion that Parliament will deliver on the matter
Depending on the decision that will then be taken by the Council , the Commission will take a decision in regard to compliance with Community law
In more concrete terms , the Commission reserves to itself the possibility of bringing the question of the legal basis before the Court of Justice
There in a few words , that I hope are precise and clear , is the Commission's position on the dossier under examination by Parliament
The Commission also wishes to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Theato , and eagerly awaits your decision
Thank you Mr President , for calling me again
I would like to thank Commissioner Bonino very sincerely for her very clear statement
I think that the Council benches have also given the relevant signal to the House to resolve this conflict
That is in everyone's interest , and I ask you not to think we are working here in private
This is a public debate
Even if , for various reasons , there are very few Members in the House just now , that does not mean that we are debating in camera
I think Mr Blak made that point very clearly , and I would thank him for doing so
The debate is closed

My personal reaction to this is that I consider it a disgraceful letter and I ask myself , and I ask you and the Bureau of Parliament too , whether Members
It goes without saying that from the Chair I cannot accept any doubt about the integrity of the President or whoever was in the Chair at the time , and
During the debate with the President-in-Office of the Council I did not complain that he had not answered the questions put by a Dutch Member but that he had
The point I wish to raise concerns Rule 19 - Duties of the President - and specifically Rule 19(4) which states that: ' Parliament shall be represented in international
Two days ago the Legal Service of Parliament , acting as the agents of the House and , under that power of delegation , made a presentation to the European Court of Justice
I wish to put on record , as someone who has a long-standing interest in that policy question , that I ask whether I am entitled to receive a copy of the
Secondly , I wish to place on record that , in respect of the reports which I have heard on the question of the oral submission , I find a number of points
For that reason , I wish to ask , firstly , as I have done already , for copies and , secondly , to ask , not necessarily now but perhaps to be advised at your discretion
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let me begin by thanking you for giving me the opportunity of talking generally and then in some detail - and I consider this to
I shall start with the usual Council meeting in December , which normally deals with TACs and quotas , and then go on to talk about the three issues on which
As far as the TACs and the quotas for 1997 are concerned , these were adopted by the Council by a qualified majority after what was a very long -
In the NAFO zone there has been a reduction , particularly in regard to white hake , for reasons of conservation , and the quotas available in third country waters have been offset
Unfortunately , and despite what the Commission had proposed , no decision was taken on tuna and swordfish TACs , and it was possible only to approve a number of national measures
As far as sardines are concerned , the Commission proposed to the Council a series of measures designed to conserve sardine stocks , but the Council was not able to take a
Given the crucial importance of those stocks , particularly to Spain and Portugal , the Commission will not hesitate to propose conservation measures during 1997 if the national measures of which
Furthermore , the Council unanimously adopted all the proposals for regulations establishing for 1997 a series of conservation and resource management measures applicable to the vessels of some third countries -
We then discussed the Mediterranean , and I gave an oral account to the Council of the conclusions of the second diplomatic conference held in Venice at the end of November ,
The Commission suggestion that a technical group be set up to continue looking at the issue of the minimum sizes applicable in the Mediterranean was approved: this is an
As you will be aware , the Commission was not able to respond favourably to that request , more especially because in the past this has not produced the desired result
Moreover , the Commission emphasized that since an anti-dumping investigation is under way , it seems preferable not to interfere with that process and to direct our efforts towards achieving better
Moving on then to the three reports which the House intends debating - though it has already dealt with the section concerning the vote , I shall begin with the proposal
I must first make the point that I believe all the different Member States are now aware of the need for controls and appreciate that the way in which
I also believe that progress has been made in terms of understanding the importance of controls , including just recently; we have only to remind ourselves , for example , that not
Satellite technology has to play a fundamental role here , not only on cost-benefit grounds - satellite technology is certainly cheaper that having an observer or inspector on board every
single vessel - but also because it is far more transparent and objective in the sense that at least the position of vessels , the fact that they are at sea
I therefore believe those to be two persuasive factors that encourage us to insist on this proposal which , as I said , was not given a particularly warm reception at
As you know , the Council took a decision by a qualified majority on the introduction of satellite surveillance , on the basis of a compromise which had in fact been discussed
As a result , the satellite surveillance system will be introduced in two stages: as of 30 June 1998 in respect of certain types of activity only and then , as
We agreed - indeed we actually proposed - to exempt small-scale coastal fishing , because it seemed to us to involve excessive costs for the fishermen concerned , so that the
The Commission accepted this compromise because we took the view that , although it did not amount to complete acceptance of the Commission proposals , it represents a step the right direction ,
As far as the financial aspects of the regulation are concerned , the Commission perceives the need to provide specific financial support for implementation of the surveillance system and will therefore
I wish to begin by drawing your attention to the importance the Commission attaches to this proposal , bearing in mind the state of conservation - which I would describe
The aim of the proposal is twofold: on the one hand , it is designed to clarify and simplify existing Community law in the area and , on the other , it
The Council has not taken any decision on the proposal in question and has instructed COREPER to continue looking at the proposal itself so that a decision can at
I am therefore inviting the European Parliament to continue its work on this proposal and I can assure you that the Commission is ready to cooperate as fully as
The comprehensive and - very frequently - heated debate that has been going on for about a year on the Commission proposal for MAGP IV indicates , in my view ,
not only the importance of the issue , given that the restructuring of the Community fishing fleet is something we have urgently to attend to , but also the punctilious involvement of
First of all , there is widespread recognition that the main fish stocks have been exploited beyond reasonable limits and that a reduction in and reorganization of fishing activity now
There are , however , some who take issue with the view that the overfishing can be ascribed or attributed to the overcapacity of the Community fleet in relation to the
We therefore have agreement as far as the analysis goes but differences of view as to the solutions; but it seems to me that it the solutions on which
The Commission remains convinced that prime responsibility for this state of affairs lies with the overcapacity of the Community fleet: it is therefore the fleet that needs to be
As it is not possible to increase fishery resources or prevent fishermen from going out to sea at a time when they are already experiencing economic difficulties , we have
Clearly the objective can also be achieved , and this is envisaged in MAGP IV , by reducing fishing activity , but I would point out , not so much to the House which
has taken this on board , but to the Council , which is having problems grasping it , that a reduction in activity is hard to monitor , is often not particularly transparent and
Like you , I believe that restricted access , like a reduction in catches , is vital if we are to establish a better balance , and that the costs of restructuring must be
As far as the last Council meeting is concerned , I have to lament the fact that , despite numerous instances of consultation , the Council again deferred the decision to a later
While the Commission , like the European Parliament , moreover , considers fleet overcapacity to be the main cause , the Council has not decided to approve a priori measures to reduce capacity
I would add that the Commission has indicated to the Member States that Community aid to fleets will be suspended until a decision has been taken by the Council , as
For that reason , the Member States have been informed , from 1 January , in a letter from the Commission , that they are no longer authorized to take administrative co-financing decisions
At any rate , further analysis of the Irish presidency compromise has now been undertaken , and , as you know , the Commission has very great reservations about this compromise because , although
To conclude , the Commission has recently again confirmed to the Council that the aim is to guarantee the sector the economic productivity it needs if the fisheries sector in Europe
In response to this very worrying finding on the state of stocks , I do not believe it possible to obtain an adequate reduction in mortality rates at the levels
I wish , finally , to confirm that I myself , the Commission and the Commission services are willing to continue to work along with the House because we believe that the ultimate
Mrs Bonino , I thank you because you have given , I would say , an exhaustive account of the meeting of the Council of Ministers and of the entire very difficult and
I would only like to point out that you took twice as long - about 20 minutes - as had been allowed for , and that is an amount of time
But , like other colleagues , I have to say I regret the fact that there was no debate at the last partsession on an issue as important as MAGP IV
Naturally , as Members of Parliament , we asked for an opportunity of holding a debate in this Chamber because , as a result of problems of organization of work , the debate
Of course , the outcome of the Council meeting is , in some respects , contradictory: on the one hand there are some positive strands , such as the approval in principle of the
proposal to reconvert the swordfish fleet which concerns Italy: this is an important decision making the reconversion of that fleet with a significant environmental impact on the Mediterranean part of
I would also point out that we are providing a response to safety issues also in this way: satellite monitoring may offer important possibilities as regards safety and , of
I move on now to the more difficult issue: we need the results of MAGP III , Commissioner , as they are , of course , important when it comes to following up the
From that point of view , the socio-economic conditions have , of course , to be assessed , and this is an area in which the Council should , in my view , be doing
Today we have to debate with you and your fisheries directorate how we can make progress in the common fisheries policy , convinced that fisheries is an important branch of
It is very regrettable , as you said , that at the Council meeting in December valuable time was lost arguing about the allocation of possible fish , which may not longer exist ,
We welcome the proposal not just to simplify but also improve the technical measures for stock conservation: nets with larger meshes , more selective nets with square mesh panels where appropriate
In the excellent hearing organised by our splendid former chairman , Mr Arias Ca√±ete , one thing was obvious from the start: the chase for fish will continue mercilessly if we do
We are fortunate to have Carmen Fraga as the new chairman of the Committee on Fisheries and as rapporteur on the future of the common European fisheries policy from the
I recall the situation in December last year when we did not have the opportunity of discussing reports such as the Souchet and Kofoed reports and the aborted Escudero
I do not want to take too much time on TACs and quotas but I should like to thank the Commission for making available to us the details after the
But we must also ensure that the regulations are simple and can be readily understood by fishermen and that any research that is carried out is done under commercial
So I would be interested in the Commissioner's views on making sure that there is uniform application and ensuring that the system is implemented properly throughout the Union on
Regarding TACs and quotas , again I would raise the strategic problem here of ministers debating with scientists through the Commission and coming up with a compromise that allows all ministers
I feel that we need to move to a process , to be honest , where we keep the politicians out of this process; where , at the end of the day ,
maybe the ministers can say 'yes' or 'no' to the solution but cannot actually negotiate it themselves because we are just going to have a situation where the environment is
But I believe that the only way that rationalization can take place is if the industry itself decides how to do it , given a very strict environmental framework within
Lastly , I regretted very much , as far as the Mediterranean is concerned , that there was a complete defeat for the Commission , it would seem to me , on the swordfish issue
Mr President , I personally think that the determined opposition by fishermen and shipowners from various Member States of the European Union to the Commission proposal for MAGP IV was decisive
for the position adopted by the European Parliament in the last part-session , just as I think that this firm attitude was also important for the Fisheries Council , held on 19
I hope , for my part , however , that the practical solutions which are adopted do correspond to the declarations made at the end of that Council and that generally speaking , albeit
Therefore it is fundamental that the new proposals do not once again insist on unacceptable reductions which cannot be justified in the fishing fleet or the imposition of new reductions
in the number of boats , together with measures for a permanent and thorough monitoring of species evolution , and include effective forms of controlling fishery fleets and their respective techniques , providing
I am referring in particular to recent declarations made by the Moroccan Government which suggest that it intends to increase unilaterally from two to four months the biological moratorium
included in the current Fisheries Agreement which , if carried out , would be exclusively applicable to Community boats , in other words Portuguese and Spanish boats , just like the declared intention not
It is unacceptable that we tell the peoples of the Iberian countries that this Fisheries Agreement was not negotiated in close association with the Trading Association Agreement established with Morocco ,
also in 1995 , and that many of the trading concessions made then in terms of fish preserves and farming products , which had very serious repercussions on certain European Union Member
This close relationship between the negotiation of the two Agreements cannot be denied and it has even been mentioned by some people to justify and defend the respective approval ,
It is important for the Commissioner to give us her opinion on this question and tell us how , if at all , it is going to be dealt with as
part of the new proposals to be studied and presented in 1997 , since the Moroccan Government's positions - if put into practice - would naturally imply changes which the Portuguese
Mr President , Council meetings in the last few months have probably had the most important agendas for several years , dealing with three areas in fisheries management: first , the size of
The extent of the pressure which can be put on politicians is known to us all and can be seen in the results of the annual Council meeting where
So even if the Council was able , in its wisdom , to accept a programme to limit fishing effort , that would not end the story , for there would be ever-increasing
Considering the size of the other fleets in the world , there is not a great deal of room in other areas to which these vessels can go without causing
The fact that the FAO estimates that , on a global basis , one tonne of fish is thrown away for every three tonnes that is kept shows that this is
The Commission has proposed a number of progressive changes in the current technical measures including square mesh panel , increase in mesh size , grates or grids to filter out the
The Council seems bent , unfortunately , on ignoring wider public opinion in Europe and around the world , which is in favour of a more careful and precautionary approach to fishing ,
I should like to know where the fish came from that went to Northern Ireland as part of a political deal which the Conservative Government had to stitch up
This is a major problem first of all because of flags of convenience - a problem mishandled by the UK in the past - and also because of the
It is very good that Mrs Bonino comes to us now after the debacle at the end of December and says: ' Let us now talk seriously about the
The things which we knew were not going to be implemented in December we can now discuss in a realistic way and we have time for a constructive dialogue
Mr President , I wish to begin by saying that I welcome the Commissioner's appearance in Parliament today and I think we would all welcome even more appearances by the Commissioner
I welcome the decision to have satellite monitoring on larger boats , and not imposed on the inshore fishermen as well - it was a very wise decision to accept that
I also wish to say very clearly to Mr Macartney - in case he is worried - that there was no stitch-up between the British Government and the Ulster Unionists
Perhaps , if some of the people in Mr Macartney's party had the same skill in negotiations as the people in my party have in Westminster , then his fishermen might
This is of course being done under the cloak of technical and safety considerations: the identification and location of fishing vessels and , in cases of distress or shipwreck , helping
These measures , costing ECU 205 million over five years , would have more impact and more credibility with Community fishermen if they were applied to all vessels fishing in the territorial
Behind the technical debate on the conservation of fishery resources and the reproduction of species lies a political question that can be summarized as follows: do we want to
Mr President , if we just stand back for a moment and look at all the discussions that have taken place in the fisheries sector in recent months , there is one
thing that stands out above everything else and that is that the industry has completely lost confidence in the assessment of the stocks of the different fish - that is
I should just like to quote from the Annual Report of the Anglo-Scottish Fish Producers' Association , which states very bluntly: ' We must continue to question the advice of
One of the results is that we are seeing a higher proportion of smaller fish being caught - still legally , but the proportion of smaller fish is increasing , and
Mr President , first I want to thank the Commissioner for being here to tell us the results of the last Fisheries Council , and for her readiness to debate them with
It was a disappointing Council at which MAGP IV was postponed until April , the regulations for technical measures have an even vaguer timetable , and the satellite monitoring project -
This is plain weakness on the part of the Council , demonstrating its lack of harmony with the Commission and , while the latter may be guilty of putting forward certain
projects that are unrealistic , confused and lacking the necessary advance compromise , the Council can be accused of indecisiveness and of being led more by the special interests of the Member
But it is on the issue of the MAGP that I need the greatest possible clarification because , although I have no doubt that the pressure from the Council must
It is obvious , Madam Commissioner - and this House is tired of repeating it - that when the fleet is asked to make the kind of sacrifices contained in
Furthermore , this Parliament is still not clear whether some MAGPs are generically based on a reduction in strength , whether they maintain minimum determination about the need to reduce capacity , or
We have heard widely differing interpretations from your department and the only thing that is certain at the moment is that the fleet does not know for certain what
But when the Commission has to resort to that kind of threat , the obvious absence of harmony is too serious to be overlooked and the Commission shares responsibility for
Not one single serious measure has ever been taken to penalize the non-compliers , which could not receive funds for that very reason , and now a measure is introduced which
The situation is worthy of Kafka , Madam Commissioner and I want to ask you to consider the request to restore access to the structural funds , at least to the countries
It is imperative that we seek the greatest possible flexibility , otherwise Member States and the producer organizations will tend to use up their quotas to the full so as
On the other hand , the Commission's attitude , using a form of blackmail by suspending aid for the building and modernization of ships to try and force Member States to
As for the technical measures , they must be carefully tested before any general use and all factors must have been taken into account , particularly the selectivity and energy consumption of
The best protection for the resource is a fair price for the products of European fisheries which will also be , Mr President , the best guarantee for the future of
There are some positive features which many Members have commented upon , in particular the introduction of satellite surveillance , along with the flexibility allowing the industry to roll on quotas
We have frequently had debates and discussions and passed resolutions; the Commission reluctantly introduced a minimum import price a couple of years ago and then let it go after
I would like to put it to the Commissioner that she lost the battle with her colleague Sir Leon Brittan on this because we understand that he is not
Mr President , if you watch the language groups that are participating in this debate you will see that there is a lot of pressure in the north-west of the Community
I welcome the presence of the Commissioner and want to say we were proud and a little sad to note that she worked herself into the ground before Christmas
In the past , and in particular in the north-west of the Community , there has been deep suspicion in the fishing industry about how fishing policy was conducted and managed and
That is the period in which Scottish and Irish fishermen sell a lot of their produce and the prices at the end of the year are extremely important to
Since a prima facie case had been made , we thought it would have been possible but we look forward at least to a satisfactory outcome of this investigation that
At the end of the day what we need is a long-term programme - seven or ten years - with a bottom line that tells us what we can
On the one issue I want to address I will probably be shot down , but there are some parts of the European Union flag fleet that do not contribute to
They are not fishing in European Union waters: they fish exclusively outside European Union waters , under agreements which we have negotiated with various countries around the world , and those
One example , and I make no apologies for a blatant constituency interest , is that the remains of the British distantwater fleet fish off Norway , Iceland and various other north Atlantic
From this angle , there is continuity in the Council's decision and the system employed , to the extent that it is based on the principle of relative stability , which has
We continue to have a rather absurd system which bans certain trawler fleets of Member States from catching a range of species brought up in the net and they
And that is one of the reasons for the discards I just mentioned , because what are these ships going to do with the sole or cod they catch , in
In addition , equilibrium under the principle of relative stability is calculated on data and periods when some fleets saw their opportunities of fishing in Community waters reduced as a result ,
Finally , a third factor casts doubt on the current validity of the principle of relative stability as a constant of the common fisheries policy: the fact that markets for fish
have been completely liberalized , frontiers no longer exist in the Union for marketing fish , and yet extremely rigid national barriers are still in place in terms of access to Community
These points also apply when considering the necessary reform of the common fisheries policy to ensure that the distribution of quotas is not based on anachronistic criteria , regardless of what
This is nothing to reproach the December Council with , I evaluate it positively as I said at first , but I do expect the Commission to take up these ideas
and be the dynamic factor for profound medium term reform of the common fisheries policy so that the desirable equilibrium can be achieved between responsible exploitation of resources and their
It assumes that young fish are currently being caught because of the size of mesh in the nets used and we all know , Madam Commissioner , that a large part
The paradox of tougher technical measures is that they will prejudice those who respect them and make those who continue to catch young fish in breach of the fishing
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , may I say that I am very happy that this debate has been placed high on our agenda: this will dispel the dismal impression given in
But we have achieved it , so much the better , even though I understand very well that we have exempted small inshore fishing fleets , which do not place the same
And here we know that more progress will have to be made in the technical measures of selectivity and protection of juvenile fish , as I have been saying again
We must fish less - we know that - but we must also more than anything else fish better and to do this we must not only reduce capacity ,
You were an elected Member of this House , Madam Commissioner , and anyone elected is the spokesperson for men and women who find it hard to earn a living in
Mr President , I want to start this speech by thanking Mrs Bonino for the great cooperation she has shown the Committee on Fisheries of the European Parliament during the two
Moving to the substance of this debate , I have to say that after the last Council of Fisheries Ministers and after listening to the Commissioner's statement , one can only feel
Does the Commissioner recognize that the proposals have been formulated without carefully assessing their economic and social consequences and without setting up additional support mechanisms at the same time , which
How do you explain the contradiction between some TACs being generally if slightly increased and certain guidelines which , as some colleagues have mentioned , propose drastic cuts due to the
Frustration because , on the one hand , the satellite monitoring plan is pretty remote from the agreements adopted by this Parliament , without prejudice to its amendments to them , and , on the
Uneasiness , Madam Commissioner , because the Commission's letter freezing structural aid represents a sweeping measure with the same impact on Member States which , as Mrs Fraga says , have strictly complied
There is no encouragement to exemplary behaviour if pressure is not applied selectively , especially when the aid that is frozen is covered by Community support frameworks approved by the Commission ,
In conclusion , Madam Commissioner , I think the outcome of the last Council is a serious setback to the process of reforming the common fisheries policy , but we trust in your
well-known ability to relaunch that reform and contribute to adoption by the Council of the regulations awaiting approval as soon as possible , because that is what the state of the
When she negotiated the agreement at the end of 1995 , she was praised for her firm stand , but now we find , as Mr Novo said earlier , that the Commission
And finally , as Mr Novo said , referring to a Moroccan statement on non-renewal of the fishing agreement with Morocco , which could have devastating consequences , I would ask the Commission what
From a socio-economic viewpoint , I would warn against support which does not help to bring about structural change , since otherwise we shall have the same thing as in the agricultural
As far as MAGP IV is concerned , I am convinced that when there is a crisis such as the one facing this sector , the fishery sector , any proposals aimed
But I recognise that , given the state of deterioration of fishing stocks it is natural that the whole balance of the process of initiating these issues begins by setting
I am not going to discuss the scientific reliability of the basis used , but I recognise and I concede that there had to be a scientific basis to begin
But once these proposals are on the table , then we have to have a process of compromise and given that either we have to have a possibility for a
On the other hand , as I already said in the Committee on Fisheries , I cannot accept that Member States which fulfil the objectives defined in MAGP III should be penalised
with cuts in their fleets , in the terms which have already been referred to by my colleagues , Mr Fraga Est√©vez and Mr Miguel Arias Ca√±ete , and as I already mentioned
In other words there is a Community support framework , there is an IFOP regulation , and there is a basic regulation: I do not see why the Commission should indulge
But I would like to ask - and I really must insist quite clearly on this to the Commissioner - is whether there really is a will on the
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , although I exceeded my speaking time at the beginning , at least I made up for the time we did not have in December to prepare
However , the breadth and depth of the debate just held , and even the number of contributors , obliges me to group my replies under several headings mentioned by many of
Ladies and gentlemen , you must remember that the clause of agreement with Morocco included a provision that , apart from the two months of biological dormancy , and I refer here
After quite long negotiations , we have reached a joint decision to add March and April to the 'cephalopod' biological dormancy period for all ships of all flags in all areas ,
I think , for example , that the partnership meeting about fisheries , which will take place in May in Casablanca , is one step further in the Commission's activities , so that relations
with Morocco , including commercial ones , become increasingly partnership relations and are less strained so that , apart from the problems of political flourishes by one side or the other - and
Moreover , the Commission proposed more than two years ago that a general political debate on TACs and quotas be initiated but that , subsequently , over the details , this type of
night-time negotiation is better conducted at the level of technical management so that the dossier does not remain at a high political level with everybody then being able to claim
But if we can , together , do more to reduce the drama and even reduce media coverage of the subject , while making it clear that the real issue of the
I now intend to set up a kind of task force within DG XIV , not linked to day-to-day management of the fisheries policy but starting from now , that is
I also think it would be a good idea to begin consultations with the parliamentary sectors concerned , so as to give ourselves plenty of time , and to do this
After all , the Commission along with Parliament and the Fisheries Committee chairman , Mr Arias Ca√±ete , have organized many seminars and debates between the parliamentary sectors , in which many of
It is obvious that neither the chairman nor the Commission can force people to participate , but facilities were provided and the choice was there , and I hope more and
I hope , on the contrary , that this can help those among us who consider it necessary to have a MAGP to urge those who do not like it to
Perhaps you made this proposal to provoke us , to make us think about it , but may I say that stocks are at risk not only in our waters , but
Lastly , I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the real solution to the problem lies in the results of the Committee of Inquiry on measures to
I think another of your colleagues will be taking over the presidency , but I am pleased with the way we have collaborated , and the way you have collaborated with
Although this article has indeed been used before for specific measures , this is the first occasion on which it is being used to call for legislation across the entire

We have to aim for a clear definition of national policies , setting objectives at national and international level and establishing a link between forest strategy and other policies such
There is no reason why the use of timber should not be encouraged , particularly through a coherent quality policy , while at the same time , forests should become an even

The committee is also making proposals to extend the role of the Permanent Forestry Committee so that it becomes the chief instrument in the coordination of forestry matters and , at
The committee voted for this report unanimously and I hope that it will receive a large measure of support in Parliament in order to ensure that our voice is
With regard to the amendments which have been tabled , I would like to remind Members that my priority is to see that a large measure of consensus which was achieved
Mr President , I should like to begin by warmly congratulating the rapporteur , David Thomas , who has , in my view , worked long and very effectively on a very important report which
When we use Parliament's legislative initiative , we should do so on very important and special occasions , and there is no doubt that the issue we are today dealing with
We are asking the Commission to submit , on the basis of the articles of the Treaty and within two years , a legislative proposal on a forestry strategy for Europe , recognizing
the environmental and ecological role of Europe's forests , in terms of biodiversity and the part they have to play in preventing erosion and desertification and as the most important source
And we similarly refer to the economic , silvicultural and commercial use of forests , taking account of the diversity and multi-functional nature of forests and the very different experiences which
I firmly believe that all three of those elements can play a full part in the new policy for rural development which , following the Cork Conference organized by the
But I firmly believe that we have only to think of an issue such as that of the forests to realize that this is not utopian but real and
There is no doubt that we could perhaps have gone further still here in the European Parliament: in the discussions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , some argued
I do not myself think it realistic , at present , to think in terms of a common policy for forests with all the trappings of , for example , more traditional common
What we need to do is devise a strategy which properly applies subsidiarity: subsidiarity used not as an excuse for doing nothing but as an opportunity for doing things
And so , the real issue is not to spend more but to improve coordination of the resources that already exist and those measures in place at national and European level
And here we must make a clear distinction between those areas where afforestation is sensible or necessary and those where it should only be considered as a last resort
Congratulations are therefore first due to the rapporteur who , following exhausting efforts to reach a compromise through a tangle of amendments , managed to emerge with a number of basic
This was a difficult report because there are many aspects to this issue , just as the forests of Europe are many and varied in nature: they range from the birch
There are therefore general principles that have to be taken into account , such as , for instance , the first paragraph of Section A , which refers to management , which needs to
This means applying the principle of subsidiarity in the action taken , going so far as to assign direct personal responsibility to the landowner for protecting and using his forestry

It is right to encourage owners to exchange information and discuss their experiences as well as to promote forms of training and advice for forest managers and workers and ,
The Standing Forestry Committee has a crucial role to play here: we need to place our faith in it and it needs to be organized as a real task force
We need to undertake a serious study of the means of action based on a clear system of priorities: first , to safeguard forests and genetic resources; secondly , there has
The lesson is that the forests cannot become either a resource for the wood industry or a natural park from which man is completely excluded: man has to become
Before we start the voting , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to express the satisfaction of the European Parliament at the signing of the Hebron Agreement by Mr Benjamin Netanyahu ,

I should like in this House to quote Paul Billings , chairman of the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed , who said in December at the meeting of the 'European Network
In my view it gives the European consumer effective protection without at the same time introducing conditions on distance sales which would be so onerous that consumers would find it
Similarly , I am glad that the directive has been amended to enable flower delivery services such as by Interflora and other gift delivery services to continue to provide a same-day
Certainly there remains a lot to do to ensure that European consumers do have effective protection (other than their own common sense) in terms of financial services purchased at
If there is to be no comprehensive labelling system either , we feel that the consumer will be left without any real influence over his own consumption of genetically modified
After a long process due to the disagreement between the European Parliament and the Commission and Council , which required the convening of a Conciliation Committee , the European Parliament has approved
This new Regulation is needed to face up to the globalization of the economy: Member States must avail themselves of the same regulations on labelling so that no confusion can
The BEUC (the European Bureau of Consumers' Unions) has congratulated the European Parliament , which has been much more demanding about labelling than the Council , and I wish in my turn

In this matter , I am against the Greenpeace campaign which , far from responding to the detailed arguments I put forward at the same time as the Group of the Party

for the compromise , when its rejection would create a legal vacuum both at European level and in some Member States , which would be harmful to the health and safety of
But it is better to start creating a Regulation , even if it means perfecting it later on , than to reject it and having to start all over again from
The compromise reached by Parliament and Council sets the seal on a more than six-year long legislative process with a very chequered path , one which was followed closely and contentiously
But genetic engineering has not just now begun in the production of foodstuffs with the introduction of the new soya bean , but it has been here for some time , albeit
Allergens have already been successfully removed from rice and they are working on more nutritious ingredients such as the fatty acid content and on ingredients more suited to processing ,
It does strike me as a pharmacist , however , that this is the first time that we find ourselves having to authorise foodstuffs like medicines; this kind of compulsory authorization
All foodstuffs which are being marketed for the first time , even those which have not been genetically modified or produced by means of genetically modified organisms , now come under
If , for example , kiwis were not known in Europe then they would have to be subject to these rules and receive authorization , just like medicines , before they could be
In addition under the new regulation there must be a label on all foodstuffs which in their composition , nutritious characteristics or application are not equivalent to usual or established
The compromise has yet to be assessed for its detailed effect , to ensure that it meets the requirement of the European legislator that it is proper for present and future
Labelling products , however , will not provide the consumer with anything more than an indication that genetic technology was used in the production of the goods and the changes that its

As everyone knows , the purpose of this proposal for a directive is to guarantee free movement of telecommunications data , services and equipment and the achievement of this aim has been
We support the amendments maintaining that harmonization of telecommunications does not lend itself to the principle of subsidiarity because of the essentially transnational character of telecommunications networks and services , and
that , in any case , such harmonization will have to guarantee that no obstacles are put in the way of promotion and development of new telecommunications services and new networks between

The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report (A4-0414/96) by Mr Thomas , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on a global Community
Although a compromise can never be entirely satisfactory , I am pleased with the ultimate result as a Finn and therefore a representative of the European country most dependent on
According to the strategy , the current fragmented action is to be coordinated with the aim of preserving the diversity of forests , adopting an ecologically sound approach and sustainable economic
An effective environmental labelling system and the provision of information about the sustainable forestry associated with it could promote the multifunctional use of wood , which is a considerably more
It stresses principles agreed at the UN conference on environment and development in Rio and the conclusions of the Helsinki ministerial conference on sustainable woodland management and preserving the
Mr President , in conclusion I should like to thank the rapporteur and my colleagues for their cooperation in drawing up the forestry strategy and to express the hope that we
The fact is that the Commission has no reason to make haste with a heavy legislative programme which would in effect transfer substantial powers with regard to forestry affairs
The report has something of the Trojan horse about it: on the one hand , it stresses the position of the Member States by referring to the subsidiarity principle , while
The more ecologically orientated people amongst us foresters pleaded at that time that we should take into consideration not only the timber flow but equally the protection function of
So I am really pleased that the motion for resolution , which we worked out in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , refers explicitly to the commitments of the
If you are , on the one hand , claiming that forest management should respect the multi-functional nature of forests , on the other hand - we refer to the Rio and Helsinki
Positive from an ecological point of view is that we emphasize the protection function of the forest; that we want to protect and enhance the biological and economic value
I have full understanding for the Scandinavian countries and also Austria , which do not want the same fiasco which we had in the common agricultural policy before their arrival
I would recommend focusing on certification schemes like that of the Forest Stewardship Council but I would like also to warn against systems similar to the one proposed by
For my country , Luxembourg , where a large portion of our territory is covered by forest eco-systems which are managed in a way which is close to nature , a certification
As Mr Thomas has said , the use , management and conservation of European forests cannot be controlled by common rules , given how different the forests are in different parts of the
Thus the common forestry strategy , the industrial use of wood and wood production should all be based on the principles of the market economy , not on subsidies or on
We have moved away from detailed production legislation , which tightly controlled the methods of production which could be used by the individual forest owner , to more general legislation which
gives equal weight to the needs of production and the environment and in which the obligation to replant after felling is unequivocally stated , all in accordance with the declarations and
I am referring to research , the establishment of an inventory of forestry assets , measures to prevent damage to Europe's forests from air pollution , joint measures against forest fires , all
It must also be in our joint interest to be able to demonstrate that Europe's forests are managed in a sustainable manner and that great care is taken to
As long as there is less felling than growth , coal is stored in our forests and can therefore contribute to a reduction in excess carbon dioxide obtained through the
I continue to maintain that by following the direction taken in the report , the European forestry sector will prove to be a very good example to the world in
All types of forest are represented in Europe , from taiga to the tropical forests of Guyana , and we must ensure their continued existence by preserving the biodiversity of these
In conclusion , although our forests cover only a small area of the Earth , the forestry strategy of the European Union must become a world model for the management of resources
It is possible to give legitimate economic support for various environmental measures or for use in the fight against forest fires for example , but even here the main responsibility
As a representative of Europe's most densely forested country , I would just like to say the following to any potential supporters of a fully regulated , joint forestry policy: to those
Mr President , the Thomas report is very ambitious but there must be strong doubts as to whether , in general , it is possible to formulate a joint policy for all the
Is this to be at the price of more biological monoculture or of planting species not native to the national flora or which consume large quantities of water and
The report also panders to what , unfortunately , is increasingly becoming a habit in many areas of the Union , that is the proposal of new subsidies , something which can hardly have
If we want subsidies , we ought , at least , to be looking for alternative means of making savings , in the excessive set aside subsidies to large farmers growing cereals and
What this report really says to me is that there is a desire , at any price , to expand the European Union's power instead of allowing the Union , more sensibly ,
Mr President , we have heard from the rapporteur and from some of those who have participated in the preparation of the report that this should not pave the way for
Of course there are some good ideas in this report , including those concerned with the environment and with certification , but the question is how much space will be allocated
If it doesn't , let me mention another point , point 9 where it says that the 'Commission will be asked to recommend adaptation of those goals and actions affected , particularly
The more environmentally friendly wording is retracted in the next breath and replaced with the notion that the role of the forest and its value to tourism and recreation must
All this , Mr President , leads me to believe that we should vote against this report , especially if we compare it with Swedish forestry legislation which is much better , but
The initial aim of this report , drawn up on Parliament's initiative , was a general reflection on the basic features of a common forestry policy and a request to the European
The absence of a legal basis in the European Union Treaty and the fact that timber , originating from living plant matter , is considered merely as an industrial product , are
There is quite strong opposition in these new States to any common forestry policy that might resemble a new CAP , particularly with regard to forest management and exploitation , and
The first version of the Thomas report was incomplete , but incorporated in its final compromise version are a good many amendments , particularly those that I was also able to submit
I therefore ask you to support these amendments and urge you to give your closest attention to future legislative proposals from the Commission that we shall have to examine carefully
One is that , given the relative importance of forestry to what are very often fragile rural economies , I would like the Commission to take account of the part it
can play in rural development and , in this respect , it is vital that we attempt to retain as much of the added value of forestry products in the local community
This is the case in my part of the world - roads and bridges need to be strengthened and maintained - and all this against a background of constrained
In general , I welcome the rapporteur's acknowledgement that forests provide much more than the simple exploitation of their economic potential and that much of the value of forests cannot be
Nevertheless , we should not underestimate the contribution that forests make to the benefit of society as a whole and we must continue to develop at international level cooperation and
Perhaps the best service which the Commission can render at European level is to ensure that information and expertise is available and shared within the European Union in order that
Of course we all recognize the environmental function , but I want to say that the economic function of the forest should be openly recognized , because everyday reality demonstrates that
And it is also important to develop and recognize the principle of subsidiarity to the maximum , because , amongst other things , the European forest is very diverse and the social
In almost every case , responsibility for forests lies with the regions , which have legal forestry plans , naturally legitimized by their parliaments as well , and these fully-empowered regions should also
Once the economic function of the forest is recognized as well as its environmental function , and once subsidiarity is taken into account , I think we need to be capable , at
European level , of creating a scenario appropriate to investment in a forestry sector where ownership is extremely widespread and that means creating a dynamic climate for forestry investment , increasing the
The scenario should include encouraging tax incentives at state level , boosting basic and applied research on the uses of wood , gearing European forestry aid to local authority control of the
risk of forest fires , as well as ensuring the future viability of new forest stands and I would add encouraging the formation of foresters' organizations and including them in the
We are also concerned about the tropical forests the world's ecological balance depends on , and we recognize that the greatest contribution we can make to saving these vital tropical
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , at this stage in the debate stress should be placed on the particular aspects we regard as most important , because general analysis has been covered
I would like to highlight the fact that the merit of the Thomas report is to examine a sector which not only has a commercial value , as stated in the
That is why I want to draw particular attention to the need , in implementing the report's proposals , to consider the European forests as two large groups: the central and
These two large groups have different characteristics and a different influence on society , and the forests of the south are also the best bulwark against erosion and desertification , in
In terms of operational capacity , responsibility for forests is currently shared between nine different areas of the European Commission , and more rational administration is clearly needed if the European Parliament's
We think it is so patchy that we decided to table a few amendments , especially on the economic utilization side to stress that the forestry sector must have a
We need certification in which ecological criteria are agreed on an international basis and then recognised by the EU so that a wood industry can develop in the EU
For a long time the price development in the wood sector was so disastrously low that re-afforestation could not be financed by it and repeated subsidies for re-afforestation were given
We cannot transport a disastrous EU price policy to the outside because as we have already seen forests , and rain forests in particular , would be dragged down in its
We already have such certification , and it is well known that certain competitor countries on the other side of the Atlantic have exerted pressure on the Union to adopt
But if we have a common interest in the environment , a common interest in the economic welfare of the European Union , a common tourism policy and so on , it
Obviously forestry will become very important commercially in Ireland but there is resistance from a social standpoint to replacement of the small farms on the marginal land by tracts
The European policy which seeks to assist us with the development of our afforestation is not all that popular in Ireland and yet I believe it is wise in the
That can give Ireland a value added income of approximately ¬£300m at today's prices and that is three times the amount our sheep farmers are able to earn from
However , forest in Portugal is extremely important as we have forests of Hispanic oak , of eucalyptus , of Scotch pine , we used to have chestnut forests and unfortunately we used
But I also understand that countries which are very much at home with forest , the northern countries , do not want one because for them they have a different idea
Therefore , with all of the difficulties raised by the common agricultural policy , with its maximum guaranteed areas , its maximum guaranteed quantities , and the whole castration which has been inflicted on
European farming , one of the monitoring measures has been afforestation , but afforestation has never really been taken seriously and Europe will always be dependent on imports and , at this moment
It has already been stated earlier in the debate that Swedish forestry legislation has allowed us to create a sustainable and strong forestry industry which maintains a balance between the
It is important to make clear to other parts of Europe that the Scandinavian forestry sector is a resource which can be used profitably within the ecological framework without
This strategy was the only base of compromise which it was possible to reach in the European Parliament and in the Committee on Agriculture in particular , and Mr Thomas
I think that bringing about at this stage a common forestry strategy will only make sense if it is carried out gradually in the future as part of a genuine
This is the only way in which we can solve problems such as the increase in forestry production and reducing the deficit , and of finding alternative occupation for land
in terms of non-food and energy raw materials , the creation of employment in rural areas and protection from atmospheric pollution and forest fires , adding to the contribution which forests make
The activities proposed by the rapporteur - which are already a great advance on what we have at present - would cost the European Union some 350 million ECU per
In a country like Portugal , for example , where three million hectares are forested which represents onethird of the territory and 80 % of which are integrated into farms , it
All Member States of Union have common interests in the state of the forests and their use; the forests serve to bind carbon dioxide , prevent erosion and provide opportunities
Even after account has been taken of all the use made of them and natural elimination , Finland's forestry resources are increasing by more than 10 million cubic metres per
To my mind this is a practical demonstration that it has always been a vital necessity to us Finns , as it still is today , to take good care of
By way of an example of the responsibility displayed by the Finns over forestry issues , may I just mention the extensive conservation areas which have been instituted in recent
Although the current improved version of the report still does not take enough account of the Nordic point of view , it is nonetheless considerably better than the original version , and
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , permit me , on behalf of the Commission , to congratulate all of the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , and
more particularly , the rapporteur , Mr Thomas , on the quality of the report we are debating and also welcome the interest that honourable Members have shown in protecting and developing the
There is no doubt that in recent years increasing attention has been paid , including at an international level , to the question of forests: many honourable Members who have taken the
floor have already mentioned both the United Nations Rio Conference on the Environment and Development and the Ministerial Conference for the Protection of Forests in Europe that took place in
More particularly , it seems to me that the transfrontier aspect of forests has been highlighted in the references to issues such as atmospheric pollution and also in the discussions on
The situation has also changed within the Union , with the accession of forestry producer countries , such as Finland and Sweden and , to a lesser extent , Austria: given that the afforested
Indeed , speaking in this debate , some of you have pointed out that the accession of the new countries has brought a change of culture to our debate , placing greater
What suits one place could be completely inappropriate elsewhere , and extremely changeable socio-economic - and also environmental - circumstances are bound to require different analyses and solutions that have
In short , the Mediterranean forests cannot be dealt with in the same way as the forests of Sweden , and so , at the risk of making what may be a
All of those elements , and many other factors that I do not have time to list here , require , in the Commission view , detailed consideration by the Union and its Member
States to take account of the developments and the economic and social changes of recent years: the fact is that an analysis of that nature has not been made at
In that sense , Parliament's initiative certainly amounts to significant progress in terms of reviving the debate on the approach to be taken to forests at the level of the Union ,
The Commission will be looking closely at the measures proposed in the document by organizing a dialogue with the Member States via the Standing Forestry Committee and intends submitting within
Despite all that , Parliament should also be aware that defining a new strategy for forests will run into many difficulties - and I think that honourable Members are already very
Those disparities unquestionably tend to have the effect of accentuating the differences in the basic assessments made in the various Member States , and therefore situations that are so very
I have never believed it possible to have policies without adequate funding: we can then discuss how to or not to use those funds , but I have never seen
It is also worth making the point in the House that the financial situation of the Union is a very special one , and it does not seem to me
It will have both to keep abreast of the situation and take account of all the various existing constraints - the legal , the political and the financial constraints -
The quality of the proposals contained in the report Parliament has submitted will certainly help us overcome those difficulties , but I think it useful that the Commission should point
out here in the House that we are largely at the beginning of a process of review and that mutual cooperation is crucial to the success of this policy and
The next item is the report (A4-0357/96) by Mr De Clercq , on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Affairs , on the proposal for a Council decision (COM(96)0148 - C4-0323/96-96/0104(CNS))
In the context of the revision of the Treaties I would like to stress once again the need to clarify the criteria for application of the assent procedure , in
It is very difficult for businesses and for the public at large to assess the impact of these agreements and to be well informed of all the options open
I will end , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations , which I had the honour to chair for seven and a half years ,
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , this afternoon's debate on the report from our colleague Mr De Clercq and on the conclusion of the EC/Israel public procurement and telecommunications agreements gives
Firstly , as President of the Europe-Israel Delegation , I wish to pay tribute to the work of our colleague , Mr De Clercq , who has worked very hard throughout these last few
Secondly , it should be pointed out that these agreements fit perfectly into a continuation of the agreements that came into force a year ago and into the framework of the
Thirdly , I wish to emphasize the great importance of these latter agreements , which will enable Europe to benefit from Israeli high technology and will enable Israel , which wishes to build
Finally , and following on directly from the last point , I wish to express the satisfaction and delight of Europeans after the Hebron agreement of Tuesday evening and the reactivation of
In conclusion , I reaffirm that the development of our economic and scientific relations with Israel is one of the prime conditions for peace as well as being one of the
The vote on the report of our colleague , Mr De Clercq , is therefore very important , both as a symbol of a constructive and effective process and above all in its
Moreover , the two agreements flesh out the agreements concluded earlier by the European Union and Israel on greater political and economic cooperation , cooperation which I myself and my Group
It is regrettable that procedural problems always arise when matters are dealt with by the Committee on External Economic Relations and that this committee so often has to fight
I have little to add to the wise words spoken by Mr De Clercq , but I would just like to say following on from my comment on procedure that over
the past seven and a half years of international agreements of the kind we are debating today - and far more importantly the GATT agreement - the European Parliament and
In all honesty I am having trouble adjusting to the idea that in a few hours' time the Committee on External Economic Relations will have a new chairman and
But Mr De Clercq has done a great deal personally to promote the liberalization of international trade , which is economically very important to the European Union and to employment
Madam President , first of all I must congratulate you on your new office and I must also congratulate Mr De Clercq on this report , which rounds off wonderfully his seven
Thanks to the efforts of King Hussein of Jordan the peace process has moved on a pace and , if I read the situation aright , there is an increasing hope of
greater economic involvement of the European Union in Israel and the region as a whole and that is the prospect today: liberalization is all very well , it is an economic
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament is today able to express an opinion on two proposed agreements between the European Union and Israel on
Although the two agreements are as such rather technical in nature - as has been pointed out here , particularly by the rapporteur - one concerns public procurement generally and the
In the case of the first agreement , Israel is enlarging upon and adding to the undertakings entered into through the agreement on public procurement; it includes the urban transport
In the case of the second agreement on procurement in the telecommunications sector , Israel is immediately abolishing a 15 per cent price preference and gradually removing the provision on compensation
Both agreements are the product of the closer - political and economic - relations established by the association agreement between Israel and the European Union , and the post-Barcelona context of
Fourthly , they seem to us to be giving a positive signal and therefore constitute a positive precedent for other third countries in terms of opening-up markets on a reciprocal
For those reasons , the Commission welcomes the fact that the Committee on External Economic Relations unanimously endorsed the resolution approving the two agreements , after the Committee on Legal Affairs and
Let me take this opportunity of thanking those committees for their work and support and , in particular , the Commission wishes to thank Mrs Sierra Gonz√°lez of the Committee on Legal
The next item is the report (A4-0411/96) by Mr Menrad , on behalf of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment , on the communication from the Commission on worker information and
The reason why the Council of Ministers has failed to adopt various regulations on these kinds of company forms under European law is first and foremost because they could not
The most controversial issue was the idea of building in special employee representation in the company bodies , what we have with some works councils , for example: participation or co-determination
Only an informed , qualified , committed and motivated employee who has the opportunity to influence matters can develop forms of organisation and technologies and so use them in such a
Both are based on the assumption that the controversial matter of co-determination by company organs in the supervisory board or board of directors would not be pursued further and
The motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Social Affairs stipulates first of all that no European joint-stock company or other form of company can be created unless
Unlike the Commission communication it distinguishes between pure information and consultation rights , as under the EWC , and the opportunities for economic participation , like those enjoyed by employees in the
We must not transfer a specific codetermination model from a few Member States to the other countries of the Community , in other words no export of the mainly German
We therefore welcome the creation of a group of experts from both sides of industry which will identify by means of a comparative study the legal and actual situation
The suggestion in the recital that the European company statute should be made more attractive to small and medium-sized undertakings does not mean that there should be zones with no
May I briefly summarize the position of the Committee on Social Affairs: firstly , both sides of industry should play an appropriate role in establishing the rules on co-determination; secondly , employee
participation in the European company must be more than information and consultation rights of the European works councils , under no condition should there be a European company without employee economic
In conclusion may I stress the importance of that last sentence and thank all members of the Committee on Social Affairs for their solid support and the Committees on Economic
Madam President , I wish to thank my colleague , Mr Menrad , with whom I have worked for several years on this subject , and also my colleagues in the Committee on Legal
We had a vote in the committee which was nem con , showing the strength of feeling in the committee which is convinced that it is absolutely essential for
Every single British company which decides to set up as a European company should do so and have the participation of British workers , so we do not want a
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , first and foremost I should perhaps convey to you my best and heartfelt wishes for a successful social year in 1997 and a happy
That means , Commissioner , that if the Council and Commission want to press ahead on the matter of European companies - and I assume they will in 1997 - then
I think the European Parliament may hold an important key when these proposals come up for discussion , especially if they are made under Article 100a , and we are now serving
Firstly we are sorry that there was no debate beforehand with the social partners , that there has not been greater study of the different forms of worker participation which already
We think that in addition to the European works council there have to be rules which also prevent firms from shopping around to find the best country in which
And then I would also ask the Commission and the Davignon Group too to think creatively this year about legislation which , firstly , will respect the tradition of social debate in
Which , secondly , devises framework legislation at European level on information , consultation and participation in smaller firms too , not to enable them to escape the process of dialogue but on
Madam President , first may I congratulate you on the fact that you are chairing this debate and it is perhaps fitting that someone from Germany should preside over it , since
We have a number of different systems here , and how is one to align those systems in such a way that one can distil a European company out of
The second thing is that we must take account of the two main corporate systems in Europe , namely the monistic and the dualist systems , and we must find appropriate
Certainly it must not be a step backwards for countries which already have that system , but on the other hand it must not be an obstacle to countries which
Then we can perhaps get this initiative completed , but not before we have had a suitable response from the European Council and the European Commission to these excellent proposals
Let us put on one side for a moment the first of the three options put forward by the Commission because it in fact proposes that the status quo
In contrast , the third option seems more closely to reflect the requirements of all of the interested parties , by referring back to the link with transposition of the directive
We are in fact starting from the premiss that forms of worker information and consultation exist in all the Member States , based on the needs and special features of the
It is actually unfair to subject undertakings which opt for the new legal form of European company to comply with rules on workers different from those whose observance is
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , it really is crazy that a file which was begun 20 years ago still remains blocked and I have to say on behalf of
Nevertheless it is most important that we should now give this dossier a push and the reason is that the lack of a European company statute is currently costing
Some speak of 70 billion guilders a year , about 30 billion ECU , and that is very bad for us and certainly very bad too if we want to go
I wonder if the issue of worker participation really is the main reason for the lack of progress or whether within the national governments there are not also forces
Mr Pronk mentioned that there were also fiscal factors involved and I should not be surprised if that aspect of the dossier produced just as many reasons as the
I would make the point that big companies are already shopping around amongst the Member States , and outside the Union as well , though I won't go into that now ,
It is the view of my Group , and my own view too , that this kind of shopping around will ultimately leads to a downward spiral in the quality of
I have said here many times already that worker participation in modern companies is a sine qua non if competition in Europe is to match the rest of the
The Netherlands currently holds the presidency of the Council and I think that we MEPs have a duty this year to ensure that our ministers do some work on
But probably it will take longer than the term of the current presidency and I think all honourable Members of the House should be prepared to contact their ministers
The subject of workers' participation in the system of social relations in which some people see ways of exploiting the labour force and others of a non-social combination of productive
Of course , it will not only be interesting for those who , belonging to one of those schools of thought or action , feel that they have the only way of thinking
Affirming the right to information and consultation cannot , in my opinion , be a kind of co-responsibilisation of workers at a given time , given that when things are going well information
Therefore I think that the Menrad report is positive especially in respect of multinational or transnational companies but I must , however , emphasize my reservation about the refusal to identify
these actions with the participation and the co-responsibilisation of workers in management , especially since information and consultation could be used as an expedient so that workers are more ready to
But that is the real situation: the neo-liberal offensive in Europe especially is threatening and has started to reduce the effective existence of employees' chances to help shape affairs
The least that we should decide here to do together is to reverse the current negative force of this process , and Mr Menrad's report is the first step in that
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur for the work he has done but also to ask him to forgive me if I tell
However , I believe , to use the language of semantics , that some of the words used take on an extended meaning that becomes all the wider as any understanding of
One is the doctrine of a single trade union organization , as was the case in all socialist regimes , whether communist , fascist or Nazi , and the other is that of
In my country , France , the hypocrisy of the system enables us to maintain the illusion of trade union pluralism by guaranteeing in practice the preservation and privileges of the already
It is somewhat similar to the situation here in the European Parliament , where the system is really one of a single party with dual labelling and having two extremes
Thus , in France , a law on 'trade union representativeness' forbids the free candidature of workers in the first round of professional elections of staff representatives or delegates to works councils ,
Not only that , but no mention is made of the fact that the communist leaders who controlled the French CGT with a rod of iron , according to the ninth
and thirteenth directives of the 21 Moscow conditions , had supported the Hitler-Stalin pact and even , like the traitor Thorez , deserted from the French army straight away so as not to
But today , in the dishonourable , unscrupulous , disloyal war in my country against the national movement and patriotic forces fighting for the independence , sovereignty and freedoms of the fatherland , there is
a desire to ban new trade union organizations whose members are workers who no longer have confidence in the old union nomenklatura , in the apparatchiks incapable of expressing the desires
for work , with preference given to nationals , the desires for security , for self-management of wages , for setting up modern social security systems and retirement schemes that are appropriate , better managed
The Committee on Social Affairs and Employment has closely studied the Commission proposal , including an experts' hearing , and I would like to thank the rapporteur particularly for resisting the pressure
For indeed we need time to reflect on the repercussions of the statute of a small European joint-stock company on labour relations , on relations between owners , shareholders , management , the
The vision of a democratic economy , which has also been addressed , would have been important precisely at this time of economic upheaval , in view of employees' fears at globalisation;
But I as a German must point out that the German government in the last few years has taken two decisions which worsen employees' rights; one of them , for
I should also like to thank the Commission for their preliminary work , even if the communication on worker information and consultation is not exactly a success story , but that is
Apart from the various directives on mass redundancy , the transfer of companies and the European works council which were individual successes , all other proposals have ground to a halt
The Council has not exactly excelled itself by its eagerness to take decisions , and it is time that that was made public and that the people of Europe learn
But as to whether the three solutions proposed will be successful - keeping the status quo , global approach , proposals on the statute of the European company , European association or
I am also afraid that we shall need some more time to find the solution to this problem , to get in all the opinions which have been requested and
The experts' hearing on this subject in the Social Affairs Committee gave us a taste of the difficulties ahead in the search for a solution to the problem of informing
But what we must avoid is that economic opportunities of participation be replaced by simple information and consultation rights as in the EWC directive or by an as yet
Mr President , good industrial relations , with a well-developed relationship between the owners of a company and the management on the one side and the employed and the unions on the
The Commission is proposing three different alternatives at EU level: to maintain the current situation , to establish a framework or to go straight to a proposal for a Regulation
The committee supports the development of a framework , which seems to be a sensible and realistic measure , and the proposal to establish a Directive on the minimum level of information
Secondly I want to mention the deadlock in the Council - I suppose the communication from the Commission is intended to break that deadlock - as regards those aspects of
In our view this deadlock raises two questions: one - already discussed here on many occasions - is the need for qualified majority rather than unanimous decision procedure , particularly
The other is how easily the Council takes economic or economics-related decisions on the construction of Europe - see the last stability pact - and how difficult it finds
We think the Commission's three proposals are broadly unacceptable unless they are changed and we naturally agree with the rapporteur that there should be a group of experts which includes
trade unionists , SMEs , scientists , Parliament and the Commission , to give us a clear idea and a clear proposal for a directive guaranteeing worker consultation , information and participation once and for
Firstly , it is only right and essential , when you have a statute for a European company , that you also have the active promotion of the participatory , consultative processes within that
But we must remember that inside the United Kingdom people have lost their jobs and their homes and they cannot afford to lose their hope in this respect and
If there is anything that could demonstrate the proof of this and its relevance to our society , and indeed to the world as a whole , we must look to
Paying respect to this particular report is easy because it looks at the differing forms of economic units as well - the mutual societies , the cooperatives , the SMUs - and
In conclusion , therefore , I just wish to say how grateful I am to our colleague , Mr Menrad , for all the work he has done on this and I hope that
Mr President , I come from a country , Greece , which can claim no great traditions or achievements in the area of informing , consulting with and encouraging the participation of working people ,
The first concern is that there is unfortunately this two-speed development in the European Union , one speed for monetary issues and a different speed for issues related to working peoples'
The second concern is the probable danger that instead of making it easier for countries with no great achievements to forge ahead , we may hold back and drag down achievements
And I am afraid that this is confirmed by the existence of too many regulations and by the fact that all these debates are taking place largely beyond the
In this situation , I want to say that I too think Mr Menrad has produced excellent work and that proposals such as the ones about the European Company , the Committee
At a time when questions of the single market and globalisation reveal the most different framework conditions to be met by employees , acceptable framework regulations are even more necessary
But a harmonious social community demands democratic consultation and co-determination models when the existential substance of individual workers is at stake , because in the final analysis it is on
The lack of a European company statute which , for example provides for stronger involvement of employees , means a waste of resources on both sides and leads of course to considerable
It is precisely in that context that we must reiterate that the lack of a European company statute must be regarded as a deficiency because in my opinion such
The Commission's expert group which is charged with preparing recommendations for co-determination models by April must not be allowed to remain solely a platform for debate but should also give
To sum up , the Menrad report in my view contains reasonable proposals on how the objective of co-determination can be reached and it also points out the risks of inaction
Mr President , I would like to thank you and your colleagues in the European Parliament for the excellent way you have addressed the Commission communication of 14 November on worker
I believe the motion for a resolution which we are discussing and which you are going to vote on , as well as its explanatory statement , illustrates very clearly the
I thank you in particular for the great efforts you are making once again with this excellent own-initiative report , trying to help out the European institutions in this important
The second concerns the attempt to break the deadlock regarding the European Company Statute and a number of other related proposals , all of which are pending and are important
In the light of the consultations which have followed the Commission's communication , I shall be presenting to the Commission in the coming months a proposal to initiate the procedure
I very much hope that the social partners will be willing and able to identify the content of the rules which should apply here and to reach an agreement
The second issue raised in the communication is very complex as illustrated by the fact that the Commission is seeking to break a deadlock which has existed for more than
This deadlock deprives European industry of a very valuable instrument - the European Company Statute - which would be extremely useful in helping industry to adapt to the new
The European Council is well aware of the urgent need to make progress on this matter and , indeed , has reaffirmed its commitment to do just that as recently as
If , as I hope , Mr Menrad's report is adopted by the European Parliament you will be making a decisive contribution towards identifying the constructive solutions which are required and
I very much welcome the fact that you agree with the Commission on the basic precondition for progress that has to be made in this matter , and that is on
the need to find an adequate set of rules applicable to the European company which preserve national systems while at the same time avoiding imposing foreign models of worker involvement
On the basis of all the contributions received by the Commission on its communication as well as the report from the expert group , I am looking forward to coming back
I would like to look forward to having a system which would be both useful and flexible for all those wishing to use it , so that it could enjoy
To Mrs Van Lancker and Mrs Gonzalez Alvarez I would say on consultation that the Commission's communication was a consultative document and it seemed to me to be much
It was first brought up in 1970 but I would remind the House that even before that Robert Schuman spoke of the urgent need for achieving the market of
Other matters have been put in place and have been helped by the House , in particular the European Works Council , so that we can now look forward to a
It is the view of the Environment Committee that the Budget Committee's amendments should be accepted: they substitute advisory committees for management committees , thus making the whole thing more
Mr President , we have here one of those proposals which we simply have to approve , among other things because it restates principles - already set out in 1986 and then
At a time when we are proposing that the European Union make a new economic and organizational effort , it might be appropriate to consider the results of these ten years
As regards the first problem , the problem of pollution , a specialist report tells us that , between 1988 and the present , European forests have suffered continuing and progressive impoverishment as
a result of the corrosive effect of atmospheric pollution: defoliation , decoloration and the extinction of the more vulnerable plant species stimulate us to make a greater effort in the area
The study tells us that almost half of Europe's forests are at risk of fire: 400 , 000 fires were officially recorded between 1985 and 1995 , but is possible that
The main culprit is carelessness on the part of those who frequent forests to work or hunt or for recreational purposes; the second is inadequate maintenance of agricultural land
Aside from the fires started by those who are unbalanced in one way or another , there are throughout Europe criminal organizations which start fires in order to benefit from
On the basis of the principle of subsidiarity , Mr President , Commissioner , I think that we should set under way studies and inquiries on that issue in particular , before agreeing to
However , perhaps remembering the debate this evening , the substantial differences between the various countries in terms of a Community policy to support the forestry sector need to be made
Certainly there are difficulties , because there is diversity of forests , diversity in the way different countries deal with them , but if the European Union is to comply with the various
conventions it has signed - Rio Conference , Helsinki Conference and also the Vth Environmental Action Programme - it is essential not only to implement these regulations , but also , after discussions
The provision of aid always carries the risk that it will just be tacitly extended each time , when we ought to be wondering if the research objective has not
I would then find it logical , on the basis of the research findings , to switch the funding to the routine protection of forests , that is to say to measures
We shall of course have to consider all that nearer the time , but what worries me is that all too often more and more new research objectives are mooted in
Mr President , first of all I want to express the support of my group , the European People's Party , for this proposal from the Commission to extend the two forest protection
The atmospheric contamination protection programme is often thought to have been positive in its dual aims of establishing a general forest observation network - already covering the whole of the
But we are told virtually nothing about the final objective and the evaluation of these programmes which have been developed over 10 years , and one of the European Commission's
responsibilities is precisely to make the final evaluation of all these research programmes , which are focused on establishing whether or not there is a causal relationship between atmospheric contamination and
After 10 years of research throughout Europe , with the full collaboration of national research and international programmes , it is a little perplexing to find that there is still no data
The impetus for the fire protection programme and the evaluation carried out in all the European Union countries has been positive , especially in the most affected , like Spain , Portugal , Italy
But greater effort and cooperation between the Member States is still needed , because although there has been a reduction in the area burned , the number of forest fires has
actually doubled since 1986 , and there are days - this statistic ought to be on the front page of the newspapers - when two fires break out every minute in
Here , of course , we should bear in mind that in recent years the continuing destruction of forests by fire , especially in the South , has assumed uncontrolled proportions and of course ,
I think , however , and we saw the same thing this morning in the Thomas report , that the European Union is doing far less than it could , both about protection and
about improving the infrastructure , encouraging technical cooperation between the Member States , educating the workforce , and even setting up a task force for the entire European Union , which could contribute to
I do not think this closes the subject , it is simply an opportunity for us to observe , now that it is still winter and not yet summer , that the issue
Mr President , I am pleased that , in spite of everything - since there was some doubt whether there would be any at all - we are having a report and
It is a hopeful sign that the amount proposed to deal with pollution is up on the previous period , but it is surprising that the grant for fire protection
For it is noticeable that , although the number of fires increases at places where preventive work has been carried out , they are considerably smaller: the affected areas are then also
That is why , on behalf of the PPE Group , I tabled Amendment No 20 , identical with that of Mr Weber , seeking to increase the grant relating to forest fires
I would be preaching here to the converted if I were to repeat what was also rightly stressed in the debate on the Thomas report concerning the multiple role played
I therefore call urgently for the adoption of the amendment from our group , presented by my colleague , Mr de Br√©mond d'Ars , which seeks to increase the amount of Community
Having been able to appreciate , both in my own country and in the Community generally , the role played by foresters and their professional organizations in the context of good forestry
management and fire protection , I am particularly anxious that they should participate effectively in Community action for the protection of forests and I hope the Commission can reassure us on
As vice-chairman of the Hunting , Fishing and Environmental Intergroup of this Parliament , I would also like to stress the outstanding part played by hunters and their organizations in protecting forests
Mr President , although aware of the absolute need to put into effect strict preventive measures and effective rules to combat atmospheric pollution , our society is nevertheless revealing itself to be
The damage caused to forests largely results from: the atmospheric pollution caused by the major industrial complexes; the change in weather conditions brought about by this disruption to natural balances
which has devastating consequences , triggering processes of degradation , such as defoliation and foliage decoloration; and fires - both fires that result from natural causes and those which are the result
Community action will have , therefore , firstly , to seek to harmonize the efforts of the Member States to prevent this problem , which principally affects the southern states of the Union where
If we then consider the funding allocated to the two programmes on forest protection , during the first five years of their application , and note that the available resources have
We are therefore asking , on the one hand , for the Commission to identify those areas particularly at risk and make them the main target of Community aid and , on the
We are absolutely convinced of the importance of creating a fire monitoring and information system for the Community as a whole and support the request of the Committee on the
Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection that the management committee originally provided for should be replaced with consultative committees which , if nothing else , would help limit the influence of the
I would like to say to Mr Valverde L√≥pez that there has been quite some success to date when you consider the statistic that in ten years there have only
With regard to the legal basis - Amendments Nos 9 and 1 - I can understand your concern that the two measures should have separate legal bases as was previously
You have also quite rightly noted that there is a new formula for estimating the amounts needed to be stated in the two new proposals for regulations , that is , Amendments
The wording of the two regulations has been revised accordingly in the light of the precise wording of the March 1995 Interinstitutional Agreement referred to by the rapporteur , between
I would make the point about the amendments concerning the mid-term assessment , Amendments Nos 8 and 17 , that periodical evaluation reports on measures are published regularly , particularly with regard to
For the protection of forests against fire , several amendments , Amendments Nos 18 , 19 and 23 , ask for the financing of prevention measures to be made conditional on immediate replanting after
The Commission notes with much interest that there are amendments asking for an increase in the amount allocated to that action , that is , Amendments Nos 20 , 24 and 27 , which
Thank you , Mr Collins , and the Members of your committee for their very great efforts and their continuing concern for the protection of this great resource of Europe and
The next item is the report by Mrs Theato (A4-0303/96) on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on the change of the legal basis of the proposal for a
Council Regulation on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on
In December 1993 the European Parliament , under the co-decision procedure in Article 189b of the EEC Treaty , adopted a legislative opinion on the proposal for a regulation on mutual
In December 1994 the Council adopted not a common position but a political stance in which it invalidated the legal base of Article 100a proposed by the Commission and
That is how co-decision was turned into a simple consultation of Parliament , and it was done by a unilateral decision of the Council , with an abstention from one Member
On question 1 , the Council argues that the customs information system contained in the proposal for a regulation constitutes an integral community entity which does not relate to the
Why , I would like to know , did neither Commission nor Council think of separating the CIS from the rest of the proposal in order to deal with it directly
The real regulation on the introduction and development of mutual assistance , as I explained before to the House and therefore do not need to repeat today , creates a regulatory
A ruling from the European Court of Justice stipulates that a decision cannot be based on several legal bases which prescribe different procedures: Article 235 - consultation and unanimity
the Commission , added to the Council minutes in which the Commission expressed its regret at the modification to the legal base and reserved the right to avail of suitable
Mrs Theato made it abundantly clear: it is to undermine the effectiveness of the system by changing proposals from the Commission to make them less efficient and more bureaucratic
How can one seriously say that the need is to have more democracy and more transparency when at exactly the same moment the Council wants to undermine the codecision
My sole question to the Commission is: will it stand firm , possibly even going to court to make the Council accountable for a failure of the internal market system as
Mr President , I am sorry that my colleague Mr Tomlinson cannot be here , but as you all know , the constituent meetings of the various committees are taking place , and it
Looking at the Chamber , one can clearly see that this report is not a great best-seller , even though it deals with a most important sector and is perhaps one
Thirdly , because the people see Article 235 as a downward path on which the EU , by taking legislative action in new areas , is moving further and further away from
It may be that this is not bound up quite in this way with Article 235 , but once again the fact is that the people see this and we
Another factor is that we have a good committee which is agreed on these matters , and I really do hope that the Council listens and perhaps begins to show
The strengthened machinery for customs cooperation for which it provides , together with , at least , the legal possibility of creating a database for the customs information system respond to an
Secondly , the change of legal basis , involving consultation with Parliament instead of codecision and unanimous adoption by Member States instead of qualified majority voting , poses a serious institutional problem for
However , the Commission shares Parliament's opinion that this amendment in particular has no legal basis and also that , by removing the proposal from the field of application of the

Part Two - C6-0476/2007 - , and
by J√≥zsef Sz√°jer , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs , with recommendations to the Commission on the alignment of legal acts to the new Comitology Decision
rapporteur
- (HU) It has long been humanity's experience that a decision-making authority , and particularly the authorities in implementation situations , cannot go without parliamentary monitoring
a huge amount about bureaucracy in Brussels
that the Treaty of Lisbon ensures precisely more effective monitoring of the implementing authority , the European Commission , and so-called European bureaucracy
I want this to be considered by all those who think there is no need for the Treaty of Lisbon
I am convinced that , by safeguarding broader powers for the European Parliament , which is elected directly by the citizens , over the European Commission , we will serve this goal
more respects with laying down the detailed rules
this case there is no other alternative than to authorise the Commission in such matters in the interests of rapid , effective action
This still happens
and powers will extend to monitoring the actions of the Commission within the spheres of implementation and legislation
Up to now , only one legislature , the Council , had this opportunity
The European Commission has produced four packages , of which we adopted two during our summer session
The third is coming now , and my own initiative report is about the principles through which this process must be implemented and how this monitoring must be recorded
we do not consider this to be a precedent , either for the Committee procedures that are currently under way , or looking to the future
we are already realising these powers within its framework
to the budget too , so that , by taking it away from the bureaucracy , we can safeguard for Parliament the opportunities that are necessary for completing this new task
transparent
In other words , we will be taking a significant step towards having the implementing authority monitored by the legislative authority , and thus by sovereignty , within the European institutions
Thank you for your attention
Member of the Commission
- Mr President , on behalf of the Commission I welcome the two reports from Mr Sz√°jer , and my thanks to the rapporteur for his work
K√∂sz√∂n√∂m sz√©pen J√≥ska
With the first-reading agreement reached on the so-called 'second omnibus' , an additional set of legislative instruments will be brought in line to the revised comitology decision
This implies a stronger role for Parliament - for you - and closer democratic scrutiny
Council , Parliament and the Commission
With the second report , Parliament actually invited the Commission to present new proposals to adapt a further limited number of acts
I can assure you of the Commission's intention to examine thoroughly the recommendations made in your report
Once this assessment is completed , we will be able to decide how best to respond to Parliament's recommendations
Finally , let me also express the hope that the examination by the Council and by Parliament of the next omnibus will also proceed rapidly and smoothly
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow
Adaptation of a number of instruments to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny , "omnibus" Regulation , Part Two - Alignment of legal acts to the new Comitology Decision (Legislative initiative) (short presentation)
by J√≥zsef Sz√°jer , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council adapting a number of instruments
subject to the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty to Council Decision 1999/468/EC , as amended by Decision 2006/512/EC , with regard to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny -
Today , especially in connection with the preparation of the Treaty of Lisbon , we have very often heard about the European Union's so-called democratic deficit , and we have also heard
Interestingly , the Treaty of Lisbon is not supported today by precisely those whose interests would best be served by all this change , and by those who remain to be convinced
Particularly when Parliament and the Council , or the legislative authority , delegate more and more powers to the implementing authority in Europe , it entrusts the European Commission in more and
Since , in a huge number of cases , we need to react immediately when the complicated European legislative mechanism does not work , when the Council and Parliament cannot meet , and in
These two reports concern the fact that , within the framework of the agreement concluded in 2006 by the European Parliament and the Commission , the European Parliament's sphere of influence
At the same time , I would like to establish that the discussions gave rise to a good compromise , but I would like to clarify fully , on behalf of Parliament , that
These monitoring powers will be Parliament's due irrespective of the Treaty of Lisbon; in other words , the Treaty of Lisbon , which safeguards similar powers , has come a little further and
This is a gigantic amount of work for Parliament , and Parliament must be guaranteed the necessary instruments for this; and for this very reason I have taken action with regard
In other words , Parliament must also prepare for completing this task , and I think that by taking this step the European Union will also become more democratic and more
The Commission is really pleased to see that work has been advancing at quite a good rate and fair solutions have been reached between the three institutions - the
Action taken on Parliament's positions and resolutions: see Minutes
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed
Are there any comments
Mr President , I should like to say that I cast a vote in error yesterday afternoon on the question of referring the bananas issue back to committee
on small enterprises engaged in producing things like bath products and
I therefore wish I had cast my vote the other way
I wish that to be placed on the record
We will include this in the Minutes , Mr MacCormick
(The Minutes were approved)
Mr President , I only wanted to report my presence for the Minutes
I will not be signing the attendance register as I am leaving in one hour , but I wanted everyone to know that I am here
We can all see , Mrs Van der Laan , that you are here
It will be included in the Minutes

In fact , you have also received several e-mails and I have also written to the Conference of Presidents on the matter
can be spent more productively elsewhere
Consequently , there are few of us here today and we cannot guarantee that our electorate is adequately represented here
We therefore believe that a choice needs to be made: either we need to give more substance to Friday' s agenda or to abolish the Friday sitting
In this context , I wish to ask for the quorum to be checked
I think that we all know the rules by now
Mrs Buitenweg , you cannot request this on your own
Such a request must be made by at least 32 Members
I will check if there are sufficient Members present who wish to check the quorum
I notice that more than 32 Members have made this request
We will have to establish whether there is a quorum
You will undoubtedly know that there is a quorum if one third of the MEPs are present in the Chamber
(The number of Members present was counted)
I note that there is no quorum and that the vote on the Pes√§l√§ report will therefore take place in the next part-session
is here and who is not
Secondly , I would like to say that I share the concern of my colleagues who want to upgrade Fridays
I am always here as a member of the so-called "Friday Club"
I also want to upgrade Fridays , but through work and not through sabotage
Mr Posselt , the Rules of Procedure , which I have followed to the letter , are very clear on this and do not allow the electronic voting system to be used
They also specify that the outcome of the vote shall not be made known
It is up to the President to establish that there is no quorum
organisation of the markets in milk and milk products [COM(1999) 608 - C5-0047/2000 - 1999/0246(CNS)]
Mr President , I am pleased to say that I , together with a number of other colleagues from my Group , fully back the initiative which Mrs Buitenweg has taken
Needless to say , we do not aim to sabotage the work
any reflection on today' s agenda , of course
like to ask you the following: according to my interpretation of the Rules of Procedure , the request for the quorum means that none of the votes can take place
If this is not the case , Mr President , I would ask you to check the quorum before we proceed to vote on the Maat report
(More than 32 Members rose in support of this request)
(The President established that there was not a quorum)
Mr President , I have been trying to catch your eye for a while now
attend
Mr President , we have checked when exactly these people are present on Fridays
It appears that , evidently , no Friday is important enough for these people to turn up
They have had their little pleasures , Mr President
They were able to appear on radio and television last week
are trying to do a decent job here today
Mr President , I cannot accept this and would like to offer my apologies as I feel ashamed on their behalf
electorate personally , they would behave differently today
I notice that a few other Members would like to be given the floor on this point of order
We should , however , bring this to a close very shortly
I am now giving the floor to Mr Schulz
been allowed to speak
We do have individual opinions within our Group
The delegates in the Socialist Group are not unanimous here
I would therefore like to speak as someone who is against this process
debate on reform of the House
by a spontaneous action , for the fact that not everyone in Parliament has done their homework
I do not think this is fair to these delegates
the somewhat remarkable impression that through the Rules of Procedure you can change the free mandate into an imperative mandate with a duty to be present for all votes
That is nonsense
You will never be able to compel a freely elected delegate to take part in a parliamentary session or a vote if that delegate does not want to
unhelpful
(Applause)
Mr President , I feel that we are making rather a spectacle of ourselves
I am reminded of the priest who berates his parishioners because other people do not come to Church
We are here to work and those who are not here to work are preventing us from doing so
Mr Schulz is right
This is completely immoral
Secondly , Mr President , I would like us to get on with the debate
Even if the fact that we do not meet the quorum means that we cannot vote , we can still debate
our Rules of Procedure state that the quorum cannot be required if less than 32 Members are present
vote
This is absurd , and we are making a spectacle of ourselves in front of the whole of Europe
We cannot go on like this
Mr Bourlanges , I can perhaps put your mind at rest by informing you that I will , of course , refer this morning' s matter to the Bureau
Needless to say , we will discuss this matter
I think that goes without saying
my ability
I still have many requests from Members to speak
I am now giving the floor to Mr Medina Ortega
is not permitted to leave the chamber
Four MEPs have left the chamber
The practice often consists of asking for the quorum and then leaving the chamber
I would ask you , Mr President , to remember this and not to allow any MEP to leave the chamber while a count of those Members present is taking place
Mr Medina Ortega , we need to straighten a few things out
We are now working within the Rules of Procedure
Since the start of the new parliamentary term , it has been defined very clearly that every Member is allowed to leave the Chamber
be included
The doors will remain open
This is the quorum provision as it stands at the moment and this is the one I am applying
Mr Bourlanges said that we carry on voting if there are fewer than 32 Members in the Chamber
This is not the case
The Rules of Procedure stipulate that if there are fewer than 32 Members in total present in the Chamber , then there is no vote
Mr Posselt , there are many points of order to cover
I am giving you the floor for the last time
Mr President , I think it is genuinely important
I appeal to the delegates to end their demonstration
They have made their point , but now it is a matter of hunger in Ethiopia and we must vote on it
Motions for resolutions (B5-0345/2000 , B5-0348/2000 , B5-0360/2000 , B5-0392/2000 , B5-0395/2000) on the famine in Ethiopia
Mr President , I am very sorry but we did announce this action six weeks ago - it has not exactly appeared out of the blue
We have given everyone , including the Presidents , the opportunity to change the agenda if this was considered necessary
Nobody acted upon this
I have not heard of any action to change the agenda , even on the part of the Members who are now complaining
This action , the quorum action , will continue , not only today , but every Friday in Strasbourg , until we have achieved our goal
without doing their work
I have also done my homework and I do not want to mention any names , but we will be able to do this in future
We will challenge the quorum for each item on the agenda today
This will cause some irritation
It seems more sensible , therefore , to move all votes for today
We then do not need to continue with this and we can carry on with the debates and ask the Commissioner important questions
Mrs Van der Laan , I understand that you would like the quorum to be checked
According to the Rules of Procedure , a vote is to be taken on this
We need to check whether there are 32 Members who wish to support you
(More than 32 Members rose in support of this request) (The President established that there was no quorum)
Mr President , irrespective of whether this action was spontaneous or premeditated , it is still an act of sabotage by the anti-Strasbourg lobby
I , too , noticed Members leaving the Chamber during the count
This behaviour does not contravene the Rules of Procedure , but it is contrary to the notion of fair play and the proper functioning of Parliament
(Applause)
I am just so tired of being accused of not wanting to do my job because I am taking part in this action
is nobody here
That is not a serious way of doing things
If Parliament has to work on Friday , then people must be here
What we are asking for is simply confirmation of whether we are observing Parliament' s own rules
That can hardly be called frivolous
Mr President , the action which was taken is permitted by the Rules of Procedure , and therefore , those who , like me , acted in this way take political responsibility for it
purposes which all may not support , but which are nevertheless permitted by the rules which we have established for ourselves
If the rules had been different , we would have acted differently
I would ask , rather , why it is that many Members voted in favour of working on Fridays in Strasbourg and yet are not in Strasbourg today
way and then act differently is a display of blatant disregard for our institution
your reply was not correct either
no longer here
Therefore , some of the 32 Members have violated the Rules of Procedure
Report by Mrs Thyssen (A5-0077/2000) , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the draft guidelines on vertical restraints [C5-0009/2000 - 2000/2003(COS)]
Mr President , you will understand that I would like the quorum to be checked , but I think that there are clearly not enough people present
I would therefore suggest moving all planned votes to the next sitting and proceeding with the discussion with the Council
This is not the way things are done
You can ask for the quorum to be checked but the vote is on the agenda
Would you like to get the quorum checked now
(More than 32 Members rose in support of this request) (The President established that there was no quorum)
to the right also to see if anyone here wishes to speak
My second point is an appeal to the delegates
The point which is currently on the agenda , night flights , gives us the chance to carry out a roll-call vote
If you want that , and I consider it very reasonable , we should carry out this vote
Mr Mayer , I can assure you , it is not just me who casts my eye through the Chamber
I also have people behind my desk who help me in this activity
We can monitor all corners of the Chamber
I actually think that I have not made too bad a job of it
Concerning night flights , these will be discussed in a moment
We will see how the point on the agenda unfolds
I am now giving the floor to Mrs Flesch
to repeat the manoeuvre every Friday morning of a Strasbourg part-session
I am grateful to her for clarifying the purpose of this action and I agree with Mr Jacques Poos' comments
interests of the town of Strasbourg
are not now going to vote on emergency aid measures for Ethiopia
In all honesty , I think we need to make journalists aware of what we think of this kind of action
Everyone is , of course , free to act as they like
Information and communication
communication strategy
Mr President , the Union is faced with major tasks and its further development depends to a great extent on what we do here and now
we are putting a lot at risk
It is extremely important that we explain to the Union' s citizens , and the citizens of the candidate countries , what the Union stands for
An information and communication strategy must , therefore , be high on our agenda
share , moreover , because we are both journalists by profession
in our applying the policy so that the various groups in society get the information which they most need
The keywords are coordination - partly when it comes to sharing information between the Commission and the Parliament - decentralisation , targeting and optimum exploitation of the available information technology
I am curious as to how the Commission will go about the task
and inform the public at large
when I hear about an "interinstitutional" library in Brussels or similar central functions
I would much rather that the Commission' s office in Copenhagen was a little more accessible
is so extremely far away
He must understand that Brussels means all of us together , as Commission President Prodi put it
facing the task will become no less great
is an urgent matter
I believe that you share many of my views , Mrs Reding
I emphasised during my hearing before this House last September
It is true that there is a gulf between the citizen and Europe
It is true that we have all , not just the Commission , but also Parliament and the Member States , made many mistakes in our information policy in the past
develop a new information policy
Moreover , let me tell you quite explicitly that I have taken careful note of the problems which exist
I must tell you , too , that there are some things which are working well; it is not all bad
For instance , we have just started up 'Europe direct' , a new access facility for citizens looking for information about Europe
We have our Euro-info-points and information outlets in the Member States , which , generally speaking , are very successful
Along with the honourable Member , I admit that we might be able to improve the way they operate , and I shall indeed make every effort to achieve this
The honourable Member also mentioned modern technology
makes available to us
propaganda
That must be taken into consideration
We must take the psychology of the public into consideration and we must ensure that dialogue is established
new approach , i
e
Commission , not to make fine speeches , but to discuss things with them and to gain some idea of their general expectations
I am , of course , counting a great deal on Parliament to play its part in this citizen information campaign
assist them as much as I possibly can to do so - this will enable us to change mindsets
first present to the Commission , some time before the summer , and which I shall then discuss with you
society
I also think we must all clarify our respective roles
Obviously , the Parliament' s role is different to that of the Commission
I am deeply convinced that Parliament' s special role must continue
Any collaboration in the field of information must allow for the specific character of each institution
closer we are to the citizens , the greater our chances of being comprehensible , credible and effective
national and regional level , and how tasks are divided between the three institutions
We must also , openly and objectively , look at our own way of working and examine how we can avoid repeating the mistakes of the past
That , Mr President , is what I wanted to say for the time being
information policy which we are going to discuss in detail with you
Mr President , I would like to thank Commissioner Reding for her response to Mr Andreasen
We have a very committed commissioner in Commissioner Reding
Parliament
I find myself totally supportive of this motion in addressing the information deficit of the EU
The information deficit is actually more serious than the democratic deficit that we often talk about
In a sense , the information deficit and the democratic deficit are part of the same problem
In the recent past , we have had the Oostlander report in 1993 and the famous Pex report in 1998
They have analysed the problem , suggested improvements , but sadly little has been achieved
I wish Commissioner Reding well in getting on with this problem
This week I had a visitors' group from the Winchester Probus Club , mainly retired people and , in general terms , well informed about world affairs
However , you could write what they knew about the aims of the EU on the back of a one euro note
Before anyone tells me that euro notes do not exist , it would not make any difference: they could not write anything
When I speak to British groups , I often start with the question: do you want to be in the European Union
The immediate response I got this week was: "No"
Five or six years ago , the response would have been: "Yes , but we do not want too much interference"
This situation is getting worse
I know that it is a particular problem for the United Kingdom , but it is not exclusive to the United Kingdom
It is getting worse right across Europe
We only have to look at the turn-out in the European Parliamentary elections to see that
Why is this so
Why this lack of enthusiasm for the EU
To begin with , we must remember that the best advertising in the world will not sell a poor product
Even if you have a first-class product , if you do not market it properly it will not sell
We must make sure that the product is good first and then make sure that we advertise it effectively
I fear we are doing neither
There can be no doubt that , when history is written , the greatest achievement of the 20th century will be seen to be the creation of the EU
It has delivered peace and prosperity for half the continent for half the century
Now the other half of the continent is queuing up to get in , yet my constituents want to get out
I am not an expert in marketing; I know there are no simple solutions; I certainly know more propaganda leaflets are not the answer
Let me just suggest a few possibilities
What happened to President Prodi's idea of a rapid rebuttal unit
If it is in existence , it does not appear to be very effective
who often just spike it
The Commissioner said quite rightly that new technology is good
We must make more and better use of it
We must make sure that our website address is known
Parliament
With the plethora of new TV channels , with digital TV , have we got anywhere with a Parliamentary TV channel
I can watch the US Senate on television gavel-to-gavel
But not the European Parliament
We must emphasise the good-news stories of when we help the citizen
We have a Committee on Petitions that addresses a thousand petitions a year
When did the information departments of the Commission or Parliament last attend a meeting of that committee
When did they past publish any of the good news that comes from that committee
Finally , I have to address the problem of Parliament in Strasbourg
I am not anti-Strasbourg
I am certainly not anti-France
I understand that Strasbourg was the symbol of peace and unity of our continent , but that was a symbol of the 20th century
In the 21st century , I am afraid it is a symbol of waste and inefficiency
I ask Parliament , Commission and the Council of Ministers to address that problem
Mr President , Commissioner , firstly I would like to thank you for your interest and dedication to the European Union' s information activities
that the European cause really reaches the citizens
In your political activities you have always paid special attention to the most sensitive groups: young people , elderly people , the workplace , and you paid special attention to the media
next June
You have mentioned two aspects which I would like to stress: the regional dimension and efficiency
The aim of the information policy is to reach the citizens
sensitivity in terms of society and its problems
work of providing information is done at the level of the regional institutions and in conjunction with them
This goes hand in hand with efficiency
In your review of information policy , I would ask you to bear in mind the experience of certain Member States
For example , during the euro campaign , there was an agreement at the time between the European Commission and the government of a Member State
That government' s decision was to commission an information campaign on the euro from a very important advertising agency
That advertising agency made some very nice advertisements and hundreds of thousands of leaflets were distributed
However , that it is not the way to reach the public , nor is it efficient
newspapers , but that does not reach the public
Therefore , it is necessary to ensure the maximum possible degree of decentralisation
Mr President , those of us who represent Scotland in this House were very grateful when this year the Parliament decided to make its office in Edinburgh permanent
The Commission has long had an office there
The Commissioner has mentioned the importance of national regions , as well as the states , in its communication policy
I am sorry to say that this week it has been announced that The Scotsman newspaper is closing down the office of its Brussels and European correspondent
It is rumoured that BBC Scotland is about to remove its special correspondent from Brussels
That would be a disaster
It is not just the Commission and Parliament which need to think about their role
Our own media also need to look seriously at the problem of adequately reporting to their citizens the issues of Europe
May I mention one other sad case , which is of importance in the area of information and communication
I want to draw attention , yet again , to the case of the Italian language lecturers
New developments in the case have shown that the quality of openness in information and communication by the Commission on this sort of issue leaves much to be desired
In these proceedings it is vital that the interested parties are fully informed by the Commission , but the practice fails to honour that ideal
There has been some evidence this week that the former Commission has actively misled parties in cases of this kind
involving non-discrimination
That really must be taken seriously
how seriously we take the need to demonstrate to our citizens and our public the importance of what is accomplished here
I am glad that the Commission and Parliament have helped to make information available in Scotland and I wish our own media would do likewise
Mr President , a distinction must be made between information and propaganda
Mr Prodi' s Commission has started off badly with regard to information
information service
This means information and propaganda from above
Actually , this means the spread of propaganda , not information
The Commission has started off badly in the most important area of information reporting , that of public accessibility
The Commission has issued a draft for a directive on public accessibility , which , by any common yardstick , is an untenable document , more conducive to secrecy than increased public accessibility
This is the Commission' s line on information policy insofar as it concerns public accessibility
Public accessibility is just as important as information
Commission
There is a very obvious discrepancy between the official documents themselves and the conclusions being drawn
it , it is one
things out clearly either
In addition , the way Parliament disseminates information must be criticised
its contents in their office at Parliament
It has one Internet connection
Internet connections
To all intents and purposes , it is a war of propaganda that is going on here
In many respects , it is also a civil war
and has thus made it clear that there are deficiencies , that fresh efforts must be made and that we must make this issue a focus of our concerns
We thank you for this
outwardly as well as inwardly
I do not think that it was
The homework which we have to do we must do ourselves and we must not confuse information and communication within the framework of our work with self-promotion
It is a matter of Community promotion and not self-promotion
communication and information
We , and I say that very clearly , the institutions of the European Union , the European Parliament and the delegates cannot bear sole responsibility for providing information on Europe
not get directly to the citizen , because either we are here doing our work or we are involved in communication and information processes with our citizens
We cannot do both at the same time within the meaning of Maastricht and Amsterdam
Commissioner , I am waiting for your master plan , your schedule , your specific measures for implementation
The public mandataries , all persons and institutions who receive money from the EU , should be involved in this implementation
We must increasingly involve the visitor groups and also two areas of activity which , in my opinion , are in your sphere of responsibility , i
e
schools and youth , and the staff in the offices of the Community institutions must be equipped accordingly
Please submit to us a specific plan of action and a schedule
Thank you , Mr President
of necessity , be innovative
In any case , this is the impression I gained from the comments of the honourable Members
May I first answer Mr Perry
He said that the situation is getting worse
That is a very negative way of seeing things
Probably , the honourable Member is right
I just hope the situation is not getting worse everywhere
That would be terrible
But if it is getting worse anywhere , we have to take that very seriously
We cannot just say that it is getting worse and not do anything
We have to act
the future information policy
Mr Perry has addressed three specific points
Firstly , the website address should be better known
I know about this problem
On 3 April we launched the new access facility - Europe direct
We will be distributing information about this site to schools and local authorities
Regarding a Parliamentary TV channel , the Commission would not object if Parliament proposed such an activity
However , I leave that initiative to Parliament
Regarding the Committee on Petitions and creating publicity about it , the last time this was done was when I was president of that committee
I consider it very important
There are colleagues in this Chamber who sat with me on that committee some years ago
It is the committee most concerned with the Europe of the citizen
If Parliament decided to take action vis-√†-vis the citizens by utilising the Committee on Petitions , you can rest assured that the Commission would support it
(FR) Like Mr MacCormick , Mr Gas√≤liba i B√∂hm touched on a major issue related to the fact that centralising the provision of information is not viable
If information were to be issued solely from Strasbourg or solely from Brussels , it would not reach the public
information policy at all levels , including information relating to the euro
In practice , the euro cannot be introduced by means of a television programme
talk to them
And there are a great many information outlets available to us in our regions , towns and villages which can play a very significant role in this
concerned
issue with the competent national politicians , I will ensure that this is taken into account
(EN) Along the same lines , I say to Mr MacCormick that I find it regrettable if the Scottish media no longer report what happens in Strasbourg or Brussels
Of course , I cannot intervene in that respect
It is a private decision of the media
In any event it is important for all actors , including Members of the European Parliament , to intervene with the media so that they enhance their reporting about Europe
Every time I meet with organisations of journalists or organisations of editors , I ask them to give more coverage to the European political level
The information office in Edinburgh will not be closed
So at least regional policy in this area will continue
(FR) Mr Sepp√§nen said that there has been inadequate provision of information to the public and that the Prodi Commission has been too concerned with political propaganda
I hope that the honourable Member is wrong and that the provision of information will not ultimately be perceived in this way
contact with the citizen
I would like to make it quite clear , once again , that the provision of information to citizens is not the exclusive responsibility of the Commission
I am convinced that this information service can work properly only if there is close cooperation between the three institutions in question
If we do not cooperate , we will fail miserably
(DE) I thank Mr Karas for regarding the ways and means with which we will , in future , tackle information policy as a positive approach
I strongly agree with him that everyone must take a look at themselves to see where we have gone wrong
I have no intention of going into the problems of the information policy of Parliament
The parliamentarians must do that themselves , but we should all carry out Community promotion together
Mr Karas has quite rightly said that we need the Member States
That is also one of the focuses of the new information policy which I would like to introduce in the future
We need not only the Member States , but also the associations , regional and national politicians
Without them there is no way that we can get our information across
There must therefore be a concerted action between the institutions and between the people in our regions , in our States
I know that this is easy to say and difficult to implement
But unless we at least make a start , then nothing will happen
be strongly emphasised
(FR) Mr President , I cannot bring about a revolution single-handed
responsibilities in this new information campaign
This is a joint effort
It is a great challenge , but I know I can count on your support
(Applause)
Thank you , Commissioner
This is probably the first time I have heard delegates referred to as soldiers , but we know what role we are playing here
The debate is closed
Mr President , in the heated debate on the matter of the quorum I did not get a chance to speak before about my motion for the Rules of Procedure
Yesterday , there was a question from Mr MacCormick on the postponement of the vote on the COM for bananas
I share the concerns of Mr MacCormick
We requested the postponement so that we could remain involved as a Parliament in the communication process with the United States within the WTO
Had we voted in accordance with our Rules of Procedure , we would no longer have been involved
That is how it was , Mr MacCormick - he is no longer here
I would like this to be recorded
this path
I am taking note of this
This will be taken care of
I am now giving the floor to Mr Beysen on a point of order
halt
This will probably be because they have come to realise that they cannot count on the support of at least 32 delegates
leave and the game is over
today
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start the debate
Let us not enter into discussion
I will tell you what the Rules of Procedure are so that we all know where we stand
I am now giving the floor to Mr Van Hulten
Mr President , our action is not finished
I simply want to refute that our sole aim would be to disturb proceedings
What we do want is to make sure that this Parliament can work more effectively and be more credible for the next five years
This is what we are doing
you explained so well on television this week , Mr President
Mr President , I may have been accused of being subversive , but other people appear to disregard the Rules of Procedure
A request to test the quorum should not be made at the start of the debate but when we vote
Mr Speroni , let us be absolutely clear about this
According to Rule 126(1) of the Rules of Procedure: "Parliament may deliberate , settle its agenda and approve the Minutes of proceedings , whatever the number of Members present"
Deliberation is always possible
We will shortly proceed to the vote (details will follow) , and we will then see what happens
I am presiding over the meeting according to the agenda as it is before us
I am now giving the floor to Mrs Gebhardt and I hope we will then proceed to the next item on the agenda , which is night flights
Mr President , I would like to ask a question , tongue-in-cheek , in the style of Loriot
Where are they then
real work here , are absent
Where are these 32 and more who stood up before and who will stand up again , but who now , when we are discussing matters , are no longer here
I would really like to know what kind of nonsense this is
Night flights and excessive noise
Mr Vander Taelen , Mrs Van Lancker and Mr Ducarme , regarding night flights and noise pollution around airports
people that the people' s greatest concern is noise pollution
This is completely understandable if we consider that the majority of European citizens are exposed to uncomfortably high levels of noise
noise exposure
A Green Paper was presented in 1996 and nothing else has happened since
It is true that the noise problem is largely due to transport , particularly road transport , but air transport is a factor which is also giving increasing cause for concern
for it must be admitted that night flights , or rather aircraft taking off and landing during the night , make sleep almost impossible in some areas near airports
What has been done to regulate aircraft to date
Standards were last established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation in 1977
of more stringent standards , to the extent that our aircraft are extremely outdated
on fostering progress in technology
it will not allow us , in the short term , to reach our objective which is that nobody is exposed to dangerously or uncomfortably high noise levels
Faced with this situation , a number of countries and regions have taken steps to restrict access to airports at night
Unfortunately , they have not been very organised about it , with the result that some firms , particularly courier and freight companies , have reacted badly - to my mind , dangerously
They are threatening to relocate and this is creating economic insecurity in the regions concerned
I therefore feel that harmonisation at European level is imperative
Member States of the European Union
restricted and coordinated
I therefore call upon the Commission to take action in this area
I made no contribution to this morning' s debate and , with your permission , I would like to say a few words now regarding the vote
or forty Members participate
Frankly , that distresses me , for a resolution voted in by only a small number of Members carries very little weight
I took part in this morning' s action and I did not appreciate criticism from Members who interpreted it as an anti-Strasbourg manoeuvre
I am not at all against Strasbourg: quite the opposite , and I have proved it many times , despite the fact that I am Belgian
I do not wish to see Strasbourg cease working normally from Monday to Friday
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Lannoye for this initiative and for launching the debate in this Chamber on this very important matter
framework for decision-making procedures concerning the operational restrictions to be imposed on airports in the Union for environmental reasons
this communication , both in general terms and with regard to specific aspects such as night flights
the case , for example , for the general ban on night flights , could provide the most balanced solution to the issue of noise pollution attributable to certain airports
The Commission is of the opinion that decisions should continue to be taken at local level
night flights , for example , it does so in the same way as a similar region somewhere else
basis for assessing the efficiency in environmental terms of the envisaged measures restricting operations
I would also like to touch on the subject of hushkits
a new standard on noise and rules for the withdrawal of the noisiest aircraft
If , as we hope , all goes according to plan , this work will result in the 33rd Assembly of the ICAO adopting new , binding international noise regulations in September 2001
withdrawal of these devices would have greater effect in terms of environmental protection
force on 4 May next
progressive withdrawal adopted at international level
All this is in the pipeline
The Commission is working on it and would like to thank Parliament for its cooperation on this matter
I have received four motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure
The vote will take place after the debate
Mr President , noise pollution caused by aircraft is a very topical issue
We talked about hushkits not so long ago
I understand from the observations made by the Commissioner that the regulation as it has been laid down will enter into force on 4 May next
Mr President , it is not only hushkits which are causing us considerable concern
live near busy airports
At night time , in particular , this level of pollution is out of all proportion
The number of night flights should therefore be significantly reduced
But what is meant by night
At D√ºsseldorf airport , night falls at 10 p
m
, according to Mr Florenz
We in the Netherlands are far more flexible in this respect
Night does not set in until 1
00 a
m
and we do not actually term it night , we refer to it as the brink of night
as the individual Member States are applying very different rules
These lead to the direct and undesired effect that airports start to compete with each other
They reason that as long as they are flexible enough , they will get a lot of freight traffic
But , at the end of the day , it is the people living near airports who suffer
Mr President , so what needs to happen
First of all , all noise pollution , including pollution generated by aircraft , must be tackled at source
This means thorough research into low-noise engines
This means bans and international standards
European airports
pollution which was supported by the late Mrs Carmen Diez de Riviera - is this legislation
for a ban , or even a night ban
What I do want is to keep the discussion around this issue going and to continue where Parliament left off before
It was our own amendment , tabled on behalf of the European People' s Party
citizens what is theirs
That is peace and quiet at night , but this also implies a proper zonal structure , insulation and sound legislation in Europe
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the airline industry has become a growing as well as a thriving industry within the Union
This undoubtedly brings many benefits , but there are also many drawbacks
be in the balance
just that
the way , many of you frequent very regularly
The noise pollution at Zaventem has exceeded the permitted levels for a long time
The quality of life - and sleep - of the people living in the vicinity is appalling by any standard
The solution to this problem has caused great uproar in Belgium and in my government
As you know , the Belgian Government embraces people from the blue , green and red sections of the political spectrum
Well , when the green Minister had the audacity to propose a complete night ban , all of a sudden , Belgium was not big enough for the fierce discussion which followed
Commissioner , you may be red and green in your heart , and I can assure , this is what I am
I too want to continue to promote life and the quality of everyone' s existence as the supreme good
This is all well and good on paper , but this can be very difficult to implement in practice
What is worse
Having a very difficult or bad night' s sleep , day in day out , or suddenly losing your job and your income
Indeed , the parcel company at Zaventem had threatened hundreds , if not many more , redundancies
All of a sudden , the trade union and employers joined forces
measures , such as offering insulation to the houses affected
It is an improvement , but not a solution
Too many people continue to suffer from excessive noise in their bedrooms
people who work and live there , suffer as a result
We can only avoid this if night flights and noise pollution are tackled at European level
thing
I therefore hope that the Commission will be receptive to this
Europe will need to resolve the false dilemma that exists of having to choose between the economy and social and environmental considerations
We would like a standardised method to measure noise pollution within the Union
In this connection , we would also like uniform standards and an effective costing rule
In addition , we would like criteria which determine when a night ban should be instituted within the Union
In a recent communication from the Commission on air transport and the environment , an initial strategy has already been outlined
This is to be welcomed , but it is not enough
Firstly , this does not solve the current problem , as Mr Lannoye has already pointed out
Secondly , this is simply a communication , but we want hard legislation from the Commission , so that everyone knows where they stand
institute a night ban
I think that , with a little good will , this should be feasible
I am looking forward to her reply
so concentrated
of subsidiarity applies to noise
In other words , it must be possible to implement at local level without the European Union having to regulate everything
I would , however , like the Commission' s guarantee that distortion of competition is ruled out
An interesting concept in the communication is the drafting of classification lists , not only for aircraft , but also for airports
noise-sensitive airports
Mrs Van Brempt already pointed this out: we are faced with a dilemma
It is clear that certain businesses and a certain economic sector totally rely on night flights
would become pointless and they would no longer be able to offer their services
Our question is , therefore: how can we marry the two together
The Commission should then legislate against distortion of competition between different airports in different Member States
Mrs Van Brempt clearly stated what the dilemma was for the Belgian Government
It is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
a good record in combating noise and those who cannot , those who do not try their best , and then combine this with measures
Because one thing is clear: noise must be penalised
Accordingly , it should be more expensive to fly certain aircraft and it should be impossible to fly certain aircraft at night for example
A total ban would be ideal , of course , but can we afford this and where could this be done
We would like to have these questions answered by the Commission
A European framework is lacking at the moment - and you say yourself that a framework should be in place , but when
When will this happen
can we expect a framework which is sufficiently clear for each Member State , so that distortion of competition is ruled out
get up to
This would be some achievement
For example , at Schiphol , there is a kind of complaints desk for noise
Other airports do not have this but could possibly do with one
So why not exchange ideas between the different EU airports , where all of us are faced with the same problem
people closer together
Mr President , Commissioner , yesterday the inhabitants of Strasbourg forced decision makers to reject the well-known air courier firm , DHL' s , plans to set up a base at the Strasbourg-Entzheim airport
density , there might appear to be less public opposition
But this is not the case at all
citizens have the right to a peaceful night' s sleep
I could also mention the inhabitants of the areas surrounding Roissy , Satolas and Milan who are protesting
Milan has fallen into the clutches of Trans-European Networks which have failed to take into account the detrimental effect of their activities on local inhabitants' standard of living
With air traffic booming and the new economy expanding rapidly , I can foresee a fresh increase in freight in the future
The Union must react and the Commission must propose tangible measures in response to the legitimate concerns of our fellow citizens
The entire transport policy needs to be revised in order to curb , or even reduce , air transport and related noise pollution
No research has been carried out into noise pollution from airports
It is essential to transfer short-haul air freight transport to the railways
put up with excessive noise all day long
These three matters genuinely require urgent consideration
but mainly because of noise pollution
I imagine that other populations living near any airport in any large city will have the same problem
I know that in the last two months the Government of Madrid has proposed a reduction in night flights , after 11
00 p
m
, but I also know that the measures that have been taken have not had any significant effect on the quality of life of the population
Let us hope that it will improve
Hence the opportunity for this debate , which we should thank Mr Lannoye for
regional measures
pollution
We should also work towards the reduction and disappearance of night flights and the promotion of the railway
In truth , Mr President , if everybody disliked aircraft as much as I do and travelled by rail as much as I do , perhaps we would have fewer problems
in noise pollution , other types of pollution and a reduction in the enormous demand for air traffic
European Community in favour of a reduction in noise pollution which is increasing as a result of demand
feel very strongly about this issue
First of all , I must say that many of the problems are the result of bad planning or no planning at all
The airports were built haphazardly and no practical assessment of the environmental impact was made as the towns , or certain parts of them , grew up around the airport structures
Regional planning is only a recent introduction , whereas airports have existed for a long time
The first flights to operate from Malpensa , for example , began as early as 1910
of airports , we see the consequences every day , or rather we hear them , for they fill our ears rather than offending our eyes
In addition , provision of information is poor
For example , many fingers are being pointed at cargo flights
Cargo flights generate neither more nor less noise than passenger flights
727
Consequently , a thorough knowledge of the facts is necessary even for debating purposes
Then the legislative framework is also fairly complicated
International Civil Aviation Organisation , which is a supranational body
I welcomed the Commission' s remarks regarding a European legislative framework
For example , as has already been said , we need to establish what is intended by the word "night"
Does night start at 10 p
m
or at midnight
Does it end at 5 a
m
or at 7 a
m
This is something to be taken into consideration
Another factor is the involvement of the local authorities , for every airport is different
The noise impact differs even within the same airport according to the runway used
section of runway 16 it would disturb half a million people or so from the Ostia and Fiumicino communities
Local authority involvement is therefore important , although , I must stress , it needs to be within a general European legislative framework
and also the type of aircraft used into consideration
made of whether the aeroplane is excessively noisy or not , irrespective of the date of manufacture or the type of silencer used
In any case , I would stress that we must not just concentrate on the individual factors in isolation but view the issue as a whole
Mr President , noise pollution caused by aircraft is mainly a problem to those living near airports
This is , in principle , a localised problem which should , as such , be solved by the competent authority of the relevant airport
Different airports are already working on this by issuing flight bans to the noisiest aircraft or by banning certain night flights
This solution , however , is not sufficient , since aircraft are produced on a global market
Competition hinders such solutions , and creates the side-effect that more noise will be produced at other airports
In short , we are simply shifting the problem
Technically speaking , the problem is not that enormous
By using state-of-the-art technology , it is possible to produce aircraft which generate six times less noise than aircraft thirty years ago
Since the life-span of aircraft is about thirty years , the effect of these technical improvements are not felt for a long while
The question is whether this long wait is desirable
I do not think so
If we actually want to do something about aircraft noise , technical improvements will need to be implemented more quickly
The extra cost involved will obviously be passed on to the user , who will pay more for their airline tickets
The user should be fully aware of the actual costs of flying , including all environmental costs
For the sake of fair competition , this should be done on a global scale
step in the right direction
I also back the other proposals to reduce noise pollution
It should be clear that , ideally , the actual environmental costs should be brought into the equation
Mr President , Commissioner , your comments this morning on both subjects showed that we need not only rapid data highways , but also efficient air transport in Europe to remain competitive
It is obvious that this will lead , in our densely populated States , to increasing noise pollution for citizens
I support all those who have stated here that solutions can only be found jointly
I come from the region around the Cologne-Bonn airport , an extremely densely populated region
We have tried to restrict the noise pollution for citizens
Every major attempt was simply answered by the companies with the announcement that they would switch to another airport
The airports of Li√®ge and Maastricht are within a radius of almost 200 km
The companies are really not bothered about where they start and land their cargo planes , in particular
our citizens in the vicinity of airports
However , I have surmised , Commissioner , from the Commission' s report that some basic conditions for this have still not been met
data
I therefore come to my request: you have proposed specific measures to the Commission in your report
You have also set deadlines: the year 2001 for expiry of the old specification on noise emissions for old aircraft equipment
You have announced a strategy , which I welcome , for how the burden on particularly busy airports can be eased on the basis of objective data
However , you have not set any deadline for this
towards in a team effort
and embraces several areas of concern which require attention
of how to reconcile economic development with the need to safeguard the health and the standard of living of our fellow citizens
In effect , this embraces the three fields of technological , economic and regulatory considerations
Although progress has unquestionably been made on the technological side , further progress is still essential in order to renew fleets of aircraft , particularly freight aircraft
give financial and technological support to all studies and programmes which make shared information available and which facilitate the modernisation of equipment with a view to limiting environmental disamenities
However , at the same time , we have to take into account the economic aspect of the issue
issue
Any use of existing structures and the establishment of new infrastructures must conform to the legal instruments - the area-specific land use plans and national and regional development rules
Union , a phenomenon familiar to us , which is governed by decisions taken simply at local level
We cannot allow this to continue
The citizens are waiting for decisions to be implemented within the relatively near future
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to make a few brief comments with regard to our joint resolution
We are discussing night flights , noise pollution and especially sleeping disorders
the seriousness of sleeping disorders and lack of sleep
pollution , and the lack of harmonisation
to provide economic incentives in connection with noise and how to achieve aircraft noise standards
certain period and reach common agreements on this
Mr President , it is certainly not a coincidence that so many Belgian Members have taken the floor during this debate today
ban on night flights in Zaventem which , following a hefty row within the government , was withdrawn soon after
I believe that Mrs Van Brempt has outlined the dilemma very expertly
Tens of thousands of people live and sleep a stone' s throw away from the runway
15% of the population are suffering as a result of the noise pollution generated by aircraft
depression
Needless to say , it makes no sense to ban night flights in one Member State alone
Businesses , such as DHL , will then simply move to airports in other Member States
As a result , we are at risk of finding ourselves in a downward spiral , where the citizens' quality of life is pulled down with it
Mr Sterckx has already pointed out , with good reason , that measures to reduce the effects for those living near airports should not promote distortion of competition
and safety which such aircraft pose
In my town , Ostend , where the airport is situated in the centre of town , there have already been over 50 incidents , so far only leading to material damage
and which will apply to all airports within Europe
The much publicised and promised common framework for noise classification of aircraft could not be here soon enough , Commissioner , especially given the Russian situation
I also hope that the European Commission will not budge one inch from the position it has adopted with regard to hushkits and will not succumb to American pressure
Finally , I would like to ask that special attention be paid to the specific problems which smaller , regional airports have to contend with
They are fighting to remain profitable and are even unable to make the necessary investments to reduce noise pollution
near them
Mr President , I have taken careful note of all the comments made by the Members and I will pass them on to the Commissioner responsible for transport
Parliament' s message was very clear , as might have been expected , for most of the Members who spoke represent the interests of citizens who live very close to airports
danger that this will have adverse implications for employment
Of course , the question which arises is how to reconcile economics with preserving the standard of living
Clearly , the level of noise pollution from night flights varies from one airport to another , according to the topography of the areas and population density
This is why , for the time being , the Commission is not going to place a blanket ban on these flights
Moreover , very few airports in the Community impose a full curfew: Paris-Orly is the only one to impose a total ban on night flights
Munich and Berlin-Tegel limit night operations to mail freight
A general ban on night flights would therefore seriously disrupt air transport activities
Most large airports place restrictions on the use of the noisiest types of aircraft or employ economic instruments in order to limit their use
There are , effectively , a number of alternatives to banning night flights used by various airports , all compatible with Community legislation on market access
night , which one very well-informed Member referred to
the environmental characteristics of the aircraft , are some of the solutions currently employed
The question now arises of how to proceed in the future , and , most importantly , when to act
Pages 34 and 35 of the communication on air transport and the environment contain an action plan setting forth a precise schedule
I will not bore you with the details
You have the documents in your possession
The Commission has absolutely no intention of postponing decisions on this matter indefinitely
It has committed itself to precise deadlines
With regard to the regulatory framework , we aim to present it at the end of this year , or early next year at the very latest
with the new operational restrictions and the establishment of a right for people living near airports to request consultation and negotiations on noise reduction objectives
The economic measures proposed also provide for differentiated treatment of airlines according to the characteristics of their aircraft
In addition , the Commission envisages the development of a code of conduct based on current best practice
I would also like to reply to the question on the drafting of a new noise standard
The ICAO is currently working on drafting a new standard , and this is long overdue , for the present standards date from 1977 - ages ago
Given the long life of an aircraft - thirty years - clearly , the effects of a new standard will only be seen in the long term
This is why we are insisting on the fact that these new standards should be sufficiently ambitious to counteract the environmental effect of the fast-growing air industry
is restricted by environmental constraints
the Commission is doing , in tandem with decision making at a purely European level
Thank you very much , Commissioner
The debate is closed
Mr President , in principle , we should proceed to the vote
It appears that the joint motion for a resolution is approved by all the political Groups
There are therefore no complications and there are no amendments
be fitting for a resolution as important as this to be voted in by more than 40 or 50 Members
Mr Lannoye , I understand that you are moving that the vote be adjourned
You know very well that this motion is to be made either by 32 Members or by a group
Are you moving this on behalf of your Group
Mr President , I am , of course , making this request on behalf of my Group
In this case , Rule 146 of the Rules of Procedure applies
here in the Chamber will then decide
- (PT) Mr President , I would like to support this suggestion
I do not wish to be associated with the sabotage that was perpetrated today
normally
He ought to show respect to his fellow Members such as myself , a Portuguese person , who will put up with a lot , but I am here to work
itself to proceed to other votes
I find this quite incomprehensible and I think that it makes this Parliament and us look ridiculous
This is a matter which has extremely serious political repercussions
This was the speaker against
Is there anyone who would like to speak in favour of the motion
I am giving the floor to Mr Blokland
Mr President , I would like to back Mr Lannoye' s motion
I think that if there are fewer than fifty Members in the Chamber , it is unfair to vote on such a significant issue
and not just fifty Members
We have now had a speaker in favour and a speaker against
We will now proceed to vote on Mr Lannoye' s request to adjourn the vote on this item on the agenda
(The request was rejected) We shall now proceed to the vote
Joint motion for a resolution on night flights and noise pollution in the vicinity of airports
than earlier this morning
It is clear to us too that there are now even less than half of the Members here than there were earlier on
The Members who have left are a mixture of Members who supported me in my request for a quorum and those who heavily protested against it
me in this
I also welcome the fact that , clearly , the choice is not about retaining or abolishing Fridays , but very much about improving the present situation
Mrs Buitenweg , we are voting at the moment
We will not enter into a debate on Friday sittings
If you have a request on a point of order , I would ask you to submit it now , if not , I will now proceed to the vote
Mr President , I accept the vote which has just been held and that a decision has been taken to vote now
I would like to point out , however , that the voting will be by roll-call
This is very important because it will then become clear how many Members were present and , more importantly , how many have left
Ladies and gentlemen , we will now attempt to hold an orderly vote
This seems to me to be in the interest of the good Rules of this House
We are going by the Rules
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
that it is her right under the Rules of Procedure
That is correct , even though I do not approve of her behaviour politically
importance of this vote is to be assessed
I do not consider this acceptable
no longer able to do this because there were no longer enough of them
Even then a vote is fully valid
Mr Posselt , you are absolutely right
It is a fact that all votes are valid , irrespective of the number of those participating
The legality of this vote is thus beyond dispute
Mr President , we all have experience of trade union movements , national parliaments and so forth
perfectly within their rights to do so
If , however , a right is somehow abused , I am not sure if that abuse has anything to do with democratic ethics
I am speaking on a more general note here
problem
What causes me particular regret is that we all have experience of national parliaments and so on and this sort of abuse rarely takes place
ever since the first day of the new parliamentary term , we have requested more clarity regarding Fridays , i
e
to have either a proper meeting or no meeting at all
for everyone to sign the attendance register at the end of the day
It would then become clear if we would be prepared to consider this a proper meeting or not
I therefore recommend that this problem be raised in later proceedings so as solve this Friday problem once and for all
Mr Meijer , I would thank you and other Members for their creativity in coming up with solutions to this problem
This will not help us any further this morning
service and at the service of the Rules of Procedure
further
This is clear enough , I think
I would now like to proceed with the discussion of the next item on the agenda , so that we can debate its content
Let us move on to the next item
The forestry sector after the December 1999 storms
The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions to the Commission:
1999;
(B5-0219/2000) by Mr Daul , Mr Martin and Mr Redondo Jim√©nez , on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats
are certainly not relaxing in front of their televisions but are working in the field
The issue is wider than that
In reality , this is nothing more than a feature of the anti-Strasbourg sniping which has developed
Let us be completely clear about this and not try to pretend it is otherwise or to evade the issue
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on the forestry sector
certain information and undertake to help those of our citizens - and they were numerous - who were in difficulties , for this disaster affected the whole of Europe
tangible response from the Commission to this question
Did we actually intervene
Did we employ the means available to us
This time , we are not claiming appropriations for exceptional circumstances under the "natural disasters" heading
will be in permanent difficulties , and with it the primary processing industry
Four months on , the purpose of this oral question is therefore , Commissioners , to inform you , first and foremost , that the condition of the forestry sector is critical
In the space of two days , 193 million cubic metres of timber have flooded the market
to pay
We are familiar with the regulation of the market in the context of the common agricultural policy
crisis
It could have temporarily regulated the timber market for a period of several months
The question has been put to you
What action are you going to take
Secondly , what have you done and what have you achieved with the means available
to fungal or parasite risk is totally unacceptable , provided that there is a buyer
If we want to support the market , we must support the transportation necessary for export to places further afield
Is the Commission prepared to take steps to do this
To what extent has it implemented Article 87(2) of the Treaty , which allows it to grant exemptions
To what extent , if at all , has it approached the WTO to request it to grant derogations
What has it done to set up means of remedying the natural disasters affecting the forestry sector
These are not virtual instruments
We have rules , such as Article 30 of Regulation 1257/1999
If it has not done so , what action does it intend to take in the forthcoming weeks
The matter is urgent
Finally , I call for the DOCUP development plans to give unequivocal consideration to the forestry sector and the timber industry
those employed in the industry
to assist the Member States
Union , and also the Council of the European Union , have repeatedly stressed that the Treaty does not lay down any specific competence for a Union forestry policy
Thus , the European Union does not have the necessary means to intervene in the way stipulated by the two resolutions
In effect , timber is not among the products listed in Annex I of the Treaty
There is no legal framework and timber cannot therefore be governed by a specific market policy , even temporarily
Although such actions are theoretically possible under WTO regulations , well-defined , solid legal , economic and commercial grounds would be necessary to persuade our trading partners to accept them
To date , the Commission has not received a detailed analysis justifying its taking such a step
I will come back to this point in a moment
sites in the industry , and the Member States have to decide on the procedures for providing this aid
the effects on competition at European level
the Member States in the event of natural disasters
countries outside the Union
the compatibility of this measure with the Treaty on the basis of recent information
The French authorities may be requested to provide further information
Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) , I would further stress that the Commission is prepared to be extremely flexible
However , it is first of all up to the Member States to amend their initial programmes
end of 1999
In this context , actions are proposed for the removal , storage , transportation , protection and replenishment of the devastated forests in order to support the sector
These dossiers are currently under negotiation between the Commission and the Member States , but I can state here and now that the Commission' s attitude is favourable
I have received five motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure
The vote will take place after the debate
Mr President , first of all , I would like to congratulate you on the way you handled the debate this morning
You encountered a storm and weathered it without the help of the Commission
Germany and Austria
There is an urgent need for us to begin using the instruments available to the Union to assist the affected regions and support the individuals and companies concerned
of the products and the restoration and protection of forest ecosystems
Thus , in the Alsace region alone , more than 6
5 million cubic metres of woodland has been devastated , which is essentially equivalent to one to three years' harvests
Clearly , the influx of timber onto the market will send prices plummeting and so further damage the industry' s economic operators
exploit them
The inter-trade system introduced in France can certainly play a major part in the search for , and development of , these joint solutions
timber sector and ensure respect for the great internal balances which make it possible to consolidate the whole
Although regional in scale , inter-trade bodies also have a local impact and are immediately efficacious in critical situations such as that of our forestry companies and the timber industry
defining forestry policies and hence with regard to the search for immediate solutions to crises
They are also able to identify bottlenecks in the implementation of safeguard programmes
This is why I ask you not to disregard direct consultation with the industry' s operators in your consultation mechanism
the ground , the water sampling limits , which are set at 5% of the low water discharge in France and 30% in Germany and waste disposal monitoring
I therefore feel that exceptional measures should also be implemented
The scale of the disaster shows that the aid pledged by the State or confirmed at local level will not be sufficient to cover the damage reported
objective 2 or former objective 5b areas
windfall
It would also be desirable to promote incentive measures for using the poorer quality wood for energy production
However , the urgency of the situation calls for flexible , simplified procedures to financially supplement the provisions already introduced by the Member States
the consensus , the more effective the solutions will be
day to Germany , where the forests were unrecognisable
Further south-west , in France , my parents spent many days in the dim light of the petroleum lamp which I had given to them once as a present
We do not know when and in what form the next disaster will strike
Permit me , therefore , to say something about the current problems and to expand on one aspect of the comments of my fellow MEP and friend , Gilles Savary
action within the European Union if we are faced with a crisis situation as a result of accidents or natural disasters
We presently have neither the money nor the infrastructure for this
We should not in future rely on cross-border neighbourly aid as in the case of the storms at the end of the year
It was offered on a voluntary basis in an exemplary manner
It is also a healthy and important expression of solidarity
However , in itself it does not constitute a European solution
The European Union must take full responsibility for its citizens
The Commission must , therefore , quickly rack its brains to find instruments for rapid and effective emergency aid
We will expect proposals for solutions soon
We need have no qualms about making these proposals unconventional and bold
There will certainly be no lack of support from the European Parliament
The time has come to move on
But first we must sort out the current consequences of the Christmas storms
This involves three things in particular
Firstly: we must not let the timber market collapse and must , therefore , directly intervene on behalf of the many small and medium-sized enterprises
Secondly: we must , as an exception , also support necessary transportation and exports of valuable timber to third countries
The Commission must urgently discuss the approval of export subsidies with the WTO
Thirdly: we must do everything we can to counter the risks of fungus , pest and fire so that the damage does not become even worse
to organise the common European market
last December
Mr Barnier was very emphatic in his speech , assuring us that the European Union was , in effect , going to do something to help the victims
tourists
Well , now we know that forests do not fall within the remit of the European Union
So we are going to use part of the Structural Funds to finance emergency aid in the event of natural disasters
Yet we are well aware that this will take time
And , in this regard , may I say that the European Union' s policy consists of robbing Peter to pay Paul
We cannot support this policy , for it amounts to depriving some to provide for others , to the detriment of future projects
In my opinion , this is really not good enough , and we expect tangible measures from the Commission
The citizens are calling for immediate action
to better illustrate the price drops in the timber sector and the implications for foresters and timber exporters
The resolutions deal mainly with the regulation of the timber market and export subsidies
timber sector going
The storms were more than just an environmental disaster for all of us and an economic problem for the profiteers of the timber sector
accident rate which will continue to rise
The discomfort and danger involved in their profession is illustrated by the fact that there were over 100 casualties in the 1990 storms in Germany
The forestry workers' salary is shamefully low - a mere 6900 francs
They are calling for a decent salary which offsets the risks involved in their job
and sometimes death of a number of workers each year
We support these legitimate claims
in fulfilling its promises of aid
The Commission has a duty to learn the lessons of the storm disaster , and strengthen the effectiveness of Community texts
institutional support
This must be remedied and the States concerned must be awarded logistical support in the follow-up to the initial emergency period
In its resolution last January , Parliament asked the Commission to submit practical proposals if it were found that the funds available for aid were insufficient
So what has become of these famous practical proposals
impossible to sell wood
And what measures has the Commission taken or planned to promote the immediate cultivation of damaged plots of land , without which the effective reconstruction of our forests cannot begin
Sadly , one merit of this ordeal is that it will have reminded us that wood is an industrial raw material , one that is , furthermore , essentially renewable
The sustainable and efficient management of our forests requires an economically viable forest
Similarly , only sustainable forestry can provide a proper foundation for a competitive wood industry , while making a crucial contribution to the development of rural areas
The Member States are , and must continue to be , the main operators in forestry policy in Europe
This must not , however , stop Europe pursuing the coordinated management of forestry issues
The sometimes extremely binding regulations governing the single market apply to forestry products
In return the Community must provide support for these products , especially at times of crisis
Community action in favour of the forestry sector is appropriate inasmuch as it creates added value for the national action which has been undertaken
support for the implementation of a world convention on forests
devastated forests
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is now some three months since Hurricane Lothar caused devastating damage to forests in Europe , and in particular France and Baden-W√ºrttemberg
In Baden-W√ºrttemberg alone the accumulation of storm wood runs to about 25 million solid cubic metres
This equates to three times the average annual felling and this has already led to 30% lower timber prices
Just the cost of remedying the damage in Baden-W√ºrttemberg , the area for which I can speak as the delegate , runs to about DM 1
5 billion , of which DM 300 million are needed simply for reforestation
However , Hurricane Lothar is not a problem specific to Baden-W√ºrttemberg
France and other EU States have also been greatly affected
already allocated
However , the redistribution of funds was made subject to approval and this approval has not yet been given
forest owners
I would like to stress once again that we are dealing here with extremely long-term damage which may also have ecological implications
Tidying up , storage and reforestation all involve intense physical work
Commissioner , I know what I am talking about
I am a farmer
I have seen how the hurricane took the roof off our stable and I have seen the state our private woods are in
We were able to put things right ourselves but , by and large , this is not the case for all areas , all persons , all communities
You can see that
But that this is done quickly and efficiently and , above all , is sustained long term is an ecological necessity
for rural development
He indicated , as you have today , Commissioner , that you are willing to give consideration to , to help
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President , the natural disaster which overtook European countries was tragic
I am in complete agreement with the Members who have spoken on the matter and , believe me , the Commission would love to be able to do something about it
Yet neither the Treaties nor the budgetary regulations provide for this possibility
As I said before , no Community framework exists which would allow the Commission to adopt initiatives to provide direct aid to the forestry sector
Moreover , the same applies within the framework of Regulation 1257/99
It is the Member State itself which has to adopt the necessary initiatives and provide for appropriate aid
According to the principle of subsidiarity , the Commission cannot direct resources from the rural development programme towards channels supporting the timber industry following storm damage
The Commission cannot apply competition regulations to authorise national aid or joint financing initiatives under the provisions of Regulation 1257/99
its power and more , and is being as flexible as it possibly can
but is wholly the responsibility of the Member States
This is something which the Commission cannot change for the moment for that would mean amending the Treaty , although reform of the Treaties is currently being discussed
national governments to this effect
Commissioner , you have been extremely active this morning
The debate is closed
We shall now proceed to the vote
Joint motion for a resolution replacing the resolutions on the economic effects of the recent storms on the forestry sector in Europe
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Declarations of vote and other declarations
our work properly and voting are no longer present to turn this Parliament into an undignified circus
week for the plenary meeting was agreed in Strasbourg
This Parliament has actually agreed , and I also say this to the delegates over there who want a democratic vote , that Friday will be a session day in Strasbourg
tricks to sabotage Fridays
I was a Member of this Parliament 35 years ago and in all my time I have never seen such abuse of the Rules
One really should expect delegates to respect a democratic decision reached by majority , such as that concerning our session calendar , even if it does not suit them
who are starving in Ethiopia
This latter point is especially grave and reprehensible
I hope that those who instigated this procedural circus will be punished by the voters
hope that measures will be taken by the EU , as proposed here , in order , above all , to prevent small and medium-sized enterprises going under
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President , I would very quickly like to go back to the events which took place during the explanation of votes or during the point of order this morning
I am very new to this Parliament and I would just like to express my deep disappointment at the incident
Of course , I respect the Rules of Procedure and democracy , but the strategic , political action of a mere forty or so Members has prevented us from voting on Ethiopia
relation to whom Parliament was prevented from adopting a position this morning
I am extremely concerned
Ethiopia and to have lent them the support of this Parliament
Once again , I apologise to the people of Ethiopia
Mr President , I would like to support what Mr Daul has just said
For me also the timber trade is something of great importance , but then our aid to Ethiopia is equally important
once more to clearly ask: where are those who this morning arranged this whole theatre
Why are they not here now at the end of the session , proving that the work of Parliament is genuinely important to them
That is the real question
Mr President , like everyone else , I am deeply concerned about the situation we have landed up in
I find it disagreeable to have taken part in the votes we have had when there are so few of us
which are as illegitimate as I believe they must be when there are so few of us
I support the protest action which has been taken here today
unchanged
If that is the case , vigorous protests are certainly needed so that we can bring about a change , for matters cannot continue like this
We shall be a laughing stock throughout Europe
I notice that , today , we are concluding this sitting with approximately fewer than 40 Members here to make decisions
It is disgraceful
Mr President , firstly , I voted in favour of the last motion and the amendments thereto
That was the formal declaration of vote
I would like to rid certain people here of the misconception that those who took the initiative for quorum counts are no longer present
It is true that some have left
But I am one of the people who took the initiative and I am still here , just as I am here every Friday
I have noticed that some people say that there are people who are after a four-day week , but I am certainly not one of them
today is anything to go by
And this is why the problem has arisen
If Fridays were like Tuesdays or Wednesdays , then it would not have been necessary to have this debate and the counts here today
abolished , which is once again a likely scenario
agree with the serious concerns and actions it puts forward , although this does not represent a change in my Group' s position
Our position is that we have concerns about the Union' s courts having responsibility for forestry policy
and I am delighted that the PPE has suggested a nominal vote , which will clarify the matter
There is a French saying about the arroseur arros√© - the biter being bit
Here we have the saboteur sabot√© - the saboteur hoist with his own petard
It is deplorable that we have been involved in this circus
Those concerned could have made a point of order , since it is an important issue that the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents have to address
But they went too far
They showed no consideration for Ethiopia and sabotaged the votes
They then suggested a nominal vote so a count could be taken
longer present
s sitting
also tactical and strategic aims coming into play
It is no different for you than for those colleagues who tried what they did
For the first time this morning I joined in the request for the quorum to be established
I am a supporter of Strasbourg and a supporter of Fridays
However , I am of the opinion that those who wish to ensure that the work of Parliament continues to be carried out should also be present
because I thought that it was about Strasbourg and Fridays
For that reason , I did not go along with it any further
But the fact that those delegates did what they did you have to grant them
You then have to respond accordingly
The Rules of Procedure , and I would like to pay my respect to the President here , were sensibly interpreted this morning with great composure and great calm
Matters proceeded as was established
The votes which were carried out are proper votes
They are no less valid because only a few delegates participated
a positive outcome
Mr President , I would first of all like to thank the President of this eventful sitting , the Members present and Mrs Reding
frank , in contrast with those declarations made at the time of the incidents , which may have been rather rash
which led us to believe that Europe was much more involved than it actually intended to be
abroad
This is a matter of genuine symbolic and political significance
So thank you
my regret and shock at the fact that we have exploited the plight of the people of Ethiopia to further our petty games
Friday working , it is blatantly obvious that this morning' s events were an attack by the anti-Strasbourg faction
And , even more seriously , it appears that this incident may well be repeated every Friday
who managed to derail this morning' s sitting
We simply need to return to the issue of the agenda again as soon as possible
It is a well-known fact , and I am publicly admitting it before all those here today , that the Chamber is never full because Parliament' s work is specialised
Nevertheless , we must stop trying to hide
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President , I would like to remind the House that , several months ago , Parliament rejected an amendment calling for Friday sittings during plenary sessions in Strasbourg to be abolished
At the very least , one would expect Members to abide by their vote
This amendment was rejected by a large majority
Therefore , we cannot now make any changes to our practices for the year 2000
Finally , I would like to join the Members who have spoken in expressing my profound shame at the incident
Parliament was prevented from voting to send aid to Ethiopia by petty political issues
I feel truly ashamed
Mr President , I , too , regret the actions which prevented this House from working this morning
However , I welcome the fact that all those who have spoken before me also condemn the manoeuvres and they are the hardest-working Members of this Parliament
I feel that we must be constructive in learning from this morning' s events
In the first place , we have a Treaty and positions of the European Parliament in favour of Friday morning sittings
We must enforce the Treaty and the European Parliament decisions
meetings in Strasbourg , for we should , on the contrary , be making every endeavour to enhance their status
my colleague , Mr Meijer
I have been in this House for 21 years in all , although only 6 of those as a parliamentarian
I have taken part in every Friday session for 21 years , even when I had another job and was not a delegate
In this regard , I would also like to thank the staff who work so exceptionally on Fridays
However , irrespective of that , I would like to say that I have repeatedly seen such attempts over these 21 years
For this reason we introduced a quorum for determining the quorum because we wanted to rescue Fridays
That is how all this came about
can be passed
That was the consensus , and this consensus was reached here
Perhaps it is a healthy shock and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf is perhaps right
But I would ask you to clearly understand that Friday was never intended for legislative resolutions
These resolutions are not legislative
They are , however , important and they are consensual
and in a dignified manner
Thank you , Mr Posselt
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned

We in this Parliament risk setting ourselves on a course which will fail to help the banana growers and , at the same time , will continue to inflict grave injustice
Mr President , we were somewhat confounded yesterday by an action of a Member of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left , but I think that what I
The fact is that according to Members of various groups , the agenda on Fridays is too light , as a result of which many Members genuinely believe that their time
Mr President , firstly I would like to ask you to determine an exact figure and to carry out an electronic check during the roll-call vote so that we know who

This is why we announced this action a long time ago - the Conference of Presidents were made aware of it six weeks ago - and neither is this
I think that the outcome of the quorum count is sufficient reason for the Conference of Presidents to revise the agenda for 2001 , but at the moment I would
I note that the Members who are now asking for the quorum to be checked are the Dutch Members , or a number of Dutch Members , who do not usually
Mr President , is that the only way they can think of to sabotage our work here , by soiling the nest of so many other Members who , just like me ,
I would also like to say to these Members , if they had worked like I have in recent months and if they had been given the mandate from the
Mr President , I will not actually speak for very long , but , so far , if I disregard the comments made by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten , only those in favour of the process have
I would ask the Members who this morning requested that the vote be postponed in the absence of a quorum to consider the following: if you want to reform the
Rules of Procedure , which are indispensable in this House , if you want to improve our working practice , you cannot achieve this through impulsive actions; instead you must initiate a full
The delegates who are here this morning , who have done their work , who spent yesterday evening preparing for the work to be carried out today , are being punished here today ,
Finally , I would ask you to consider the following , and I am addressing this to my colleagues in the Greens and in the left-wing Groups of this House , who have
This is why I consider this morning' s action to be impulsive , although it did perhaps serve a purpose , but , in terms of highlighting the key issue , it was quite
Thirdly , I would like to point out the absurdity of the Rules of Procedure and ask the President to see that the matter is referred to the relevant Committee , for
Therefore , if there had only been 29 Members present we could have voted and no one could have stopped us , but , because there are more than 32 , we cannot
For the rest , as President , I am at your service at the moment and I , together with yourself , need to apply the Rules of Procedure to the best of
Mr President , since there will no doubt be another quorum vote , I would like to remind the President and the Members of this Parliament that , during a quorum vote , it
If , however - and this is according to the Rules of Procedure - one of the 32 Members who have requested a quorum leaves the Chamber , they will still
One of the options is a full Chamber , because one thing that creates the bad image which Mr Bourlanges is talking about is people signing up here and leaving
If this Parliament is to be taken even a tiny bit seriously in Europe - and it is touch and go whether it will be , given that only 50%
of citizens voted at the last European Parliament elections - then it must take itself seriously , and we are not taking ourselves seriously by sitting and discussing cases when there
I do , however , consider that it is not right to criticise those who use an instrument which was adopted by democratic vote , such as the Rules of Procedure , for
It might have been better and made more sense to vote not to work on Fridays: in fact , I put it to you that to vote in a certain

I would also like to express my disappointment at the absence from the Chamber this morning of Members whom I believed to be as concerned as I am for the

The next item is an oral question to the Commission (B5-0008/2000) , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , on the EU' s information and
Enlargement to include the countries of Eastern and Central Europe is the biggest challenge in the Community' s history , and if we do not tackle the issue correctly now ,
I am looking forward with great interest to hearing your answer , Commissioner Reding , because I know that information is also of great interest to you: an interest which we
I believe that we also have the same interest in the Union' s communication and information activities being organised in as close proximity to the citizens as possible and
I imagine that the Commission' s offices in the major European cities will be involved and that they will be assigned tasks and responsibilities and given resources to contact
The experts , the authorities and those who are genuinely interested in the EU should not have problems getting information , and I must admit that I am a little sceptical
It is the Commission' s local offices , in cooperation with Parliament' s local offices , which must meet the man on the street , the man who always thinks that Brussels
It is a very difficult task because , in my opinion , the gap between the citizens and the institutions is wide , and with the major challenges which the Union is

We must all , not just the Commission in isolation but the Commission in collaboration with the Member States and with Parliament , proceed to examine the matter in depth and
Obviously , the new information policy which we are going to be implementing will have to optimise the use of all the information and communication possibilities which this new technology
In my opinion , one of the major mistakes of the past , in our information policy , was the fact that this was often top-down information identified , wrongly , I must say , as
Moreover , I would draw your attention to the fact that my fellow Commissioner , Michel Barnier , and myself , have initiated dialogue on the Intergovernmental Conference which is to follow this

We have once again started to work within an interinstitutional working party on 'information' , in which Parliament is represented , and as part of this work , which is a tripartite
effort involving the national states , the European Parliament and the Commission , I plan to present a communication to you in the near future outlining a new approach which I shall
I cannot give you any details at this early stage of the actual proposal , as it is still being drawn up , but I can assure you that the main
pillars of this new approach will be decentralisation , subsidiarity , closeness to the citizens , the coresponsibility of the European institutions and the national administrations and also the increased participation of civil
It is possible to cooperate without the parties involved losing their own identities , but we should nonetheless all work in the same direction and we must know that the
In order to do so , we must seriously examine the way we are organised , the instruments and procedures we select , what is being done at the various levels , at institutional ,

We support the general lines which you have put forward here and which will be specified in the document which you will present and which the European Commission must approve
In order to do that properly it is necessary to take account of the regional dimension , because it is one of the fields which is a subject of great

During the current Parliament , I have had a number of assurances that the Commission is serious about upholding rights derived from Community law on behalf of lecturers in all issues
It is a point about openness , about being ready to communicate what is going on and about informing people how seriously we take rights arising from Community law and
I have heard that last autumn it issued an instruction to the national Commission offices to focus on the reporting of political information in place of the former citizens'
It offers our citizens and the media the opportunity to have hands-on access to documents themselves and draw their own conclusions , instead of being dependent on those of the
The documents state that the European Union' s crisis management troops are not a European Army , but the President of the Commission , Mr Prodi , says that whatever you call
In an information context such as this , it is important to have access to the documents and draw one' s own conclusions , as the documents do not always spell
Parliament has its own information offices , but the Finnish office apparently has no money to buy copies of the EU Treaty , which would allow Members to familiarise themselves with
To this extent , we could conclude that the officials working in Parliament' s own information office do not know what is going on in Parliament , although Parliament has excellent
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I would like once again to point out that Commissioner Reding has announced a dramatic change in the information strategy of the EU
Secondly , I would like to point out that we too must ask ourselves whether this morning' s initiative to prevent voting was a positive information and communication strategy for Parliament
In this regard we should all resolve to understand that one of the causes of the problems of the political parties and of the institutions is a problem of
Without the support of the Member States , without the support of the public representatives at borough , county and national level , without the support of all the institutions , we will

The new information programme which is going to be set up and which will integrate all the actors at regional and national level will do a lot of good for

We must not forget the importance of television but , in addition and above all , we have to keep the people at grassroots informed - to approach the people and
It would be a mistake for a policy to be managed solely by an advertising agency and not implemented at grass roots level in consultation with the citizens directly
I am in total agreement with Mr Gas√≤liba i B√∂hm when he says that we must integrate this regional dimension into our information policy and , when I discuss the
In any case , the channel which I will announce in the written statement , which I am in the process of drawing up at the moment , is dialogue and direct
I hope , therefore , that on the basis of the new information policy , which I would like to introduce , this aspect of citizen participation and citizen responsibility for Europe will

Mr President , to get back to the root of the problem , it has now been established by the various different institutions responsible for assessing disamenities and their impact on the
Under these conditions , the European institutions' delay in legislating is highly regrettable , particularly the Commission' s failure to propose practical measures to combat noise and to set limit values for
The peak levels of noise during take-off and landing are specific to air transport and , of course , this problem is exacerbated by the effect of the noise at night ,
Therefore , there has been no progress in this area for 23 years , and it is clear that aircraft replacement policies are not in any way motivated by the introduction
The recent Commission communication on air transport and the environment defines a noise reduction strategy based both on economic factors , such as improving air traffic control and airport access , and
This is a good strategy which will limit the increase in noise pollution , but in my opinion and , I would argue , the opinion of a good number of Members ,
Of course , this does not mean demanding uniformity , for regional differences must be taken into account , but there must be a common core in the approaches of the different
I also feel that the organisation of night air transport activities , which are inevitably going to be noisy whatever the level of technology employed , is certainly something which must be
Personally , I would prefer a vote in which a large number of Members take part to a vote which takes place at noon on Friday in which only thirty
One of the goals of the Commission communication 'Air transport and the environment - towards sustainable development' is precisely to launch the debate on the suitability of establishing a Community
In the course of this debate , which will be held in the different institutions , the Council of Ministers and Parliament will have the chance to express their views on
As pointed out in this communication , the Commission does not see how uniform and restrictive rules governing restrictions on use , which would apply to all Community airports , as would be
However , it also considers that a common framework is necessary to coordinate the procedures adopted in order to reach these decisions so that when a region decides to ban
And this framework could make it compulsory for all the interested parties to be consulted , stipulate an appropriate timeframe for adaptation to the new restrictions and establish a common
With regard to speeding up the withdrawal of the noisiest aircraft , the Commission is committed to the work currently in progress within the International Civil Aviation Organisation on drafting
Compared with the hushkits regulation , which is content to put a freeze on the current situation for aircraft whose certificate has been renewed , genuine international rules requiring the progressive
Meanwhile , in view of the United States' refusal to back down over the hushkits regulation , the provisions of this regulation on banning the attachment of these devices will enter into
Given that the provisions governing the banning of aircraft registered in third countries will only come into force on 1 April 2002 , the Commission' s interpretation of the conclusions
of the 33rd assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation will provide all the elements necessary to decide whether it is appropriate to replace the hushkits regulation with rules for
In broader terms too , we have to establish that , on account of the increase in air traffic , noise pollution is growing at an alarming rate , especially for citizens who
Mr President , whatever time we are talking about , it means that we need a coherent approach to noise pollution caused by the transport of civilians and freight by air ,
But it also means that we need European framework legislation which ensures that measurements are taken , standards set , zonal structures put in place in the same way for all
What we are asking for - not for the first time , in fact , we did this two and a half years ago in connection with the report on noise
Commissioner and Mrs Reding - you are representing Mrs de Palacio at the moment - you are saying that this is extremely difficult , but I am not asking you
Let us thus fight for a European directive which , thanks to Mrs Loyola de Palacio' s new impetus , ensures that we - at long last - can give our
I would like to make it clear straight away that , if Europe does not intervene , aspects such as quality of life , the economy and social factors will very much
The key question is , do we want our citizens to enjoy a good night' s rest , and even day' s rest and , secondly , are we able to give them
If you will allow me , I will dwell for a moment on the problem of noise pollution suffered at my own country' s national airport , an airport which , by
Belgium has meanwhile come up with a solution: a combination of measures which involves a restriction of noise at source , strict supervisory measures and a number of infrastructural planning
Nonetheless , Belgium , in tandem with other Member States , has taken on a pioneering role in this discussion and the question is then , will that country , with its businesses and
This is , in fact , what we are asking for and I am delighted to see that people of all political persuasions in this Parliament are asking for the same
I regret that the Commissioner - the Commissioner who is standing in for Commissioner de Palacio that is - is of the opinion that it is very difficult to
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Lannoye stated a moment ago that noise is a problem with all forms of transport , but the problem with aircraft is very specific because it is
In its communication on airports and the environment , the Commission mentioned a few things about noise , one being - and you also echoed this yourself - that the principle
This would mean that noise-sensitive airports would be distinguished from others and that certain activities could not take place at such airports but could possibly take place at less
If we asked them what would happen if there were no night flights , they are bound to say that they would have to close down their businesses , their activities
As it happens , the Belgian Government has taken a number of measures , but would it not be useful , for example , if the Commission were to compile some sort of
list of good and bad airline companies in terms of noise , if it were to draw a distinction between those who do invest in combating noise , those who can present
We have a communication at the moment and shortly we will have the report by Mrs Lucas on aviation and the environment , but when are we getting legislation , when
Would it not be useful , for example , to look at 'best practices' at this stage - to use a buzz word - so that we know what certain airports
I would ask the Commission to speed up its process and not to wait for the legislative measure alone , but to set up other initiatives in order to bring
Now the company is trying to worm its way into the Nancy-Metz regional airport , which it has targeted because of its rural location where , due to the lower population
When it comes to noise pollution from aircraft and public health in general , it makes no difference whether an airport is situated in the town or the country: all
And personally , I am in favour of banning night flights in order to respect the local inhabitants' need for a peaceful night' s sleep , for they already have to
Mr President , Commissioner , for some time the populations living close to Barajas Airport in Madrid have protested every time there has been an extension of the airport , for various reasons ,
From the joint motion for a resolution , I would like to highlight some of the proposals - please excuse any repetition - which I believe the European Commission should take
note of if it wants to reduce noise pollution: a global and integrated framework for reducing noise pollution which should lead to a framework directive with concrete and binding measures;
the uniform application of those measures in all Member States so that there are no distortions; a Community framework for the classification of noise which will allow measures to be
taken with the rigorous allocation of slots and a reduction in flights; and progress towards the establishment of a common air space , which is not in conflict with local and
In the fifth framework programme for research it would be necessary to carry out an investigation into the design of aircraft , with a view to reducing its influence on noise
All of this work should be done in conjunction with the populations and residents' associations which are already pushing , throughout the whole of Europe , as in Spain , for a reduction
We should also cooperate in the creation of a noise map in local areas which would lead finally to a serious piece of work on the part of the
Mr President , I live 10 kilometres from Malpensa airport as the crow flies and I spent all my working life as part of an aircraft control team , and I therefore
Of course , there are other structures which are public nuisances - landfill waste sites , for example , which are created from old quarries with no planning - but , in the case
The amount of noise depends exclusively on the type of aircraft , not on what is being transported: a cargo Boeing 747 produces much less noise than a passenger Boeing
Here , we have an example of the application of the principle of subsidiarity in its entirety , even extending beyond the European Union , for the standards are established by the
For example , runway 25 of Fiumicino airport is next to the sea and hardly disturbs anybody at all , whereas if an aircraft were to take off from the right-hand
In my opinion , it would , on the whole , be feasible to eliminate night flights and ban them , although , I must stress , this must be done by taking specific local factors
It should not make much difference whether an aircraft has a built-in silencer or whether its silencer is fitted subsequently: the engine noise can be measured and an assessment
The proposal from the resolution , which , among other things , presses for making information on the level of noise pollution around different airports available in a readily understood format , is a
For this reason , I would like to urgently request that we find joint solutions which achieve both objectives: a competitive airline industry in Europe and adequate noise protection for
Firstly , it is obvious from the report that there is still no common method for calculating aircraft noise and , secondly , there is still no common method for monitoring basic
My request to the Commission is that , together with the regions , you set deadlines , in the interests of both the companies and the citizens affected , which we can all work
Commissioner , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this matter of night flights and , more generally , noise pollution from aircraft taking off and landing at airport complexes is an extremely sensitive issue
This sensitive issue takes us back to a recurring problem faced by all decision makers and politicians , whether they are local , national or , nowadays , European , and that is the problem
The European Union must continue with its endeavours in the areas of research and technological development , equip itself with the means it needs to produce the standards envisaged , and
Airport complexes are hives of intense economic activity and appeal; our intention to preserve jobs , reasserted in Lisbon , means that we do not have the right to avoid this
Finally , in terms of regulation , in the absence of standardised European rules , strict harmonisation of air traffic control and restrictions must be achieved in order to prevent dumping within the
As a researcher who has examined the social effects of industrial labour , especially shift work , for years , I appreciate - and this has also been adequately proven scientifically -
Against this background , the entire discussion is relatively serious , bearing in mind Mrs Oomen-Ruijten' s comments on "the brink of the night" and the way we are discussing noise
In the foreseeable future , we will discuss at great length the more general aspects of aviation and the environment within the committee , including the common noise classification schedules , how
However , one thing is still lacking from the discussion , namely that we will need the political courage to talk about restrictions , bans if necessary , for night flights during a
The problem of night flights in a densely populated country such as Belgium is a very topical and extremely sensitive issue , especially since the Belgian Transport Minister issued a
Medical reports have shown that people living near airports are having to deal with health problems of an unacceptably serious nature , such as insomnia , high blood pressure , stress and
The increase in the number of noisy , obsolete and unlisted Russian aircraft , in particular , is the cause of unacceptable noise pollution , not to mention the risks for the environment
I therefore concur with Mrs Oomen , who advocates uniform framework legislation , which will reconcile the economic and employment interests with the care for public health , the environment and safety
This is why I would ask Europe , where possible , to help out in order to guarantee the viability of airports , but especially the quality of life of those living
On the other hand , it was pointed out , and very rightly so , that airports represent major economic factors and that , if we start to impose bans , there is a serious
A notable example is the use of a noise quota system such as that employed by the London airports , or a ban on using the noisiest runways during the
In addition , the use of flight paths which generate less noise pollution , avoiding sensitive districts during take-off and landing , and the application of differentiated airport tax , calculated according to
This harmonised framework could include common reference points for measuring the operational noise levels to be limited or prohibited , a provision allowing operators sufficient time to come into line
In the short term , the Commission considers that rules stipulating the progressive , but rapid withdrawal of the oldest and noisiest aircraft are the best solution , especially for airports whose capacity
And the best way to ensure the environmental efficiency of these rules is to act at a worldwide level within the framework of the International Civil Aviation Organisation , as
I would , however , like to request that the vote be deferred , if only out of a desire for consistency with this morning' s events , and also because it would
This means that one speaker in favour and one speaker against may take the floor in respect of Mr Lannoye' s motion to adjourn the vote , and the majority
I think that the person who decided on this course of action should have said whatever he wanted to , but he ought to have allowed the sitting to continue
I do not understand at all how , after what happened , this House can have chosen not to vote on the resolutions on Ethiopia , which are urgent , and have allowed
This is why it is important that this Parliament make a clear statement , and a clear statement is only possible if a large majority of this Parliament is present ,
Mr President , various Members , such as Mr Beysen , who has disappeared and reappeared in the meantime , and Mrs Gebhardt , have already remarked that there are fewer Members in the Chamber
It seems to me to be a good thing that this debate has got under way and I would like to extend warm thanks to the Members who supported
Mr President , I would like to say something about the Rules of Procedure which I think is very important given that the MEP , when she asked for a quorum , cited
But she has now said something which must be objected to in respect of the Rules of Procedure , namely that we will now see from the numbers how the
Under our Rules of Procedure a vote is fully valid if it has materialised in a proper fashion , even if those who requested that the quorum be determined were
The reason for rules of procedure is that they guarantee democratic principles and obviously if , at some time , someone wishes to highlight a particular political problem , then they are
In other words I am not sure if , in the final analysis , it has more to do with being obstructive than with proving that there is indeed a genuine
Mr President , I have already asked for the floor four times this morning in order to point out to those Members who expressed irritation at this morning' s events that ,
I think that the problem could be solved very quickly if we could schedule the votes for the end of the session , like all the other days , and ask
All that remains for us to do this morning is to apply the Rules of Procedure in an honest and transparent way and , as such , I am at your
Needless to say , I will refer this morning' s course of events to the President and the Bureau , upon which the competent parliamentary committee will deal with this matter
(B5-0217/2000) by Mr Savary and Mrs Gebhardt , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on the problems in the forestry sector following the storms in December
Mr President , I welcome this point of order , for foresters and the forestry sector cannot wait for the outcome of these rather irregular debates which can only have one effect
today , and that is to send out a message proclaiming that the European Parliament is made up of absentee Members , whereas most of our fellow Members , including those here today ,
As it happens , we already expressed our sympathy , as we are wont to do , in a resolution of 20 January 2000 , and requested that the Commission supply us with
Now , four months later , we are sufficiently removed from events to be able to learn both from what has been done and what has not , and we are expecting a
The sector is simply assessing the extent of its difficulties and the resulting risks - economic risks , security risks , that is to say fire risks , and also risks of
non-reforestation , for if it is not possible to remove the wood in the coming weeks , many foresters would prefer to leave them where they are , and then the forestry sector
The first question is that of price control and regulation of the market , since the cost of removing some low-quality species is now more than the market is willing
We are not asking you to include timber in that policy , but it appears that Europe could have employed equivalent measures to assist the timber market during this exceptional
I refer to the means which allow us to grant exemptions from the competition laws to help exporters , for the cost of transportation of timber which has been exposed
Mr President , I would like to inform the honourable Member that the Commission is quite aware of the extensive problems caused by the hurricanes at the beginning of December 1999
in Denmark and Sweden and at the end of December 1999 in France and Germany , the devastating effect on the entire forestry industries of these countries and the implications for
May I refer you to Mr Barnier' s speeches at the plenary sitting of 18 January 2000 , when he stressed that the Commission would willingly employ every available means
Nevertheless , with regard to forest damage , I must also remind you that the European Parliament , notably in its resolution of 31 January 1997 on the forestry strategy of the European
It is therefore , first and foremost , national aid to the timber industry which is the most appropriate means , at national , regional or local level , of supporting the worst affected forestry
The Commission is therefore currently assessing the national aid systems notified to it by the national governments for alleviating the effects of hurricanes on the forestry sector according to
The departments of the Commission are assessing these aid systems , particularly in the light of Article 87(2b) of the Treaty , which governs the compatibility of the aid envisaged by
The aid programmes notified by the French Government do , in fact , contain a general measure supporting the windfall transportation which may result in some of the timber being transported to
The Commission stresses that Article 87 , paragraph 2b of the Treaty does not constitute an exemption from GATT regulations as such , and we and our legal departments are assessing
With regard to the joint financing of aid programmes proposed by Member States under Article 30 of Regulation EC/1257/99 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and
In the meantime , two Member States , including France , have presented their adapted programmes , which now include a substantial section on bolstering the forestry industry following the storms at the

States , in particular in the event of exceptional disasters such as the storms of 26 December last which caused such unprecedented damage to a number of forest regions in France ,
The need for our support is all the more pressing given that transportation , storage and forest exploitation cannot be delayed without serious consequences in terms of both the quality
Once again , the way that the sector is structured may facilitate the search for joint solutions between the upstream operators which manage forestry resources and the downstream operators which
Indeed , since they are designed not to protect the interests of any one section of the industry , they facilitate the protection of the industry as a whole , promote the
We should therefore favour direct contacts with potential partners , even more so given that inter-trade bodies are also the consultative partners of local governments and national authorities with regard to
Moreover , regulations can be a constraint which varies according to the State in question , as is , notably , the case with regard to grain storage , in respect of the impermeability of
It is therefore essential to be able to draw on the Structural Funds to finance special measures for forests and the timber industry in the case of disasters in
The same applies to rural development measures and other , more specific , economic or environmental programmes , in parallel with actions for using up workable timber , which represents about 50% of the
I therefore call upon the Commission to seek consensus with the industry as a whole and the Member States concerned in order to find effective , immediate solutions , for the greater

It concerns point 8 of the joint motion for a resolution in which we ask the Commission to create instruments which make it possible to take rapid and effective
Commissioner , when you say that national aid is the important thing now , then I would say to you that this also means that , in this instance , you do not want
Commissioner , Mr President , it is true that your news and your message are extremely disappointing when we think of the emotional concern shown at the damage caused by the storms
By victims I mean the small-scale foresters who have been ruined , but I am also referring to the small seaside businesses who now have to face the influx of
Mr President , the document on the difficulties faced by the forestry sector following the storms in December 1999 only refers to the damage caused to the wooded areas in order
For my part , I would like to speak up on behalf of forestry workers , who receive no mention at all , even though it is their efforts which are keeping the

They are demanding to be able to retire at 55 and calling for an improvement in their working conditions , which are still antiquated and result in the physical deterioration
Mr President , in relation to the storms which occurred last December , the Community did not match up to our expectations during the initial emergency period and now it is late
Between the initial emergency period and the current challenges , with problems in the transportation , storage and sale of wood , there is a chronological gap corresponding to a gap in
The Commission should use these proposals to prioritise its reaction to the slump in wood sales , for what we had feared is actually taking place , and it is becoming
This is an ideal justification for the principle of subsidiarity , for instance in matters of protection against atmospheric pollution and forest fires , or forestry certification , and also in matters of
I support the Community initiatives in favour of the tropical forests , but I am astounded that there is not the same enthusiasm to come to the aid of our own
Nevertheless , the Commission has so far refused to make additional budgetary allocations available and prefers to cite , in this instance represented by Mrs Schreyer , the fact that final agreement
has already been reached in the European Parliament on Budget 2000 and that the requirement for additional funds should be covered by the Member State in question from the funds
I consider the argumentation of Mrs Schreyer to be somewhat cynical when you consider that , only a few days later , she announced that the additional financial requirement of EUR
300 million for the EU Balkan commitment , which is undoubtedly important , would be covered by EUR 300 million from the agriculture budget without the farmers noticing it , and this includes
During his visit to the Black Forest on 16 February , the Commissioner for Agriculture , Rural Development and Fisheries , Dr Fischler , indicated broad flexibility within the existing financial framework for measures
Moreover , negotiations are in progress with the Member States and I have made it quite clear that , within its institutional and legal capabilities , the Commission is doing everything in
It is unfortunate that the institutional authorities have decided that forestry policy is to be governed by subsidiarity , and that it does not fall within the competences of the Commission
I therefore call upon all Members who are convinced that subsidiarity should not apply to forestry issues but should be the remit of the Community to make representations to their
Mr President , I voted in favour of this resolution and I am glad that those behind the sabotage which , from 9 o' clock this morning , prevented us from carrying out
Imagine if other citizens were to go about their work in the same way as those delegates who think that they have a four-day week here , even though the five-day
It is indeed a strange concept of democracy , and this also applies to the others who instigated this circus , if the opponents of Strasbourg are now using genuinely dirty
But they are bad losers and they really do not care that they have prevented important resolutions being taken for the citizens of the EU and , in particular , those
In the interest of forest owners , including in my own State where , to be fair , the last storm disaster was not as devastating as here , for example , in Alsace , I
On behalf of this Parliament , I would like to apologise to the people of Ethiopia , to the men , women and children who are suffering in a tragic situation and in
We were able to vote on the last two items , which were also urgent , but , in all honesty , I would have preferred to have voted for the people of
For this reason I would like , and I attach great importance to this since you did not previously allow me to speak again when Mrs Buitenweg falsely quoted me ,
In actual fact , I abstained from voting in all our votes this afternoon because I did not think that I wanted to be involved and participate in making decisions
I am a new Member and therefore a little shocked when I hear that the unsatisfactory state of affairs which prevails on Fridays has been going on for years ,
I am , however , of the opinion , that we need to work a proper five-day week , which is not happening at the moment , if the number of MEPs in attendance
This will now have to be carried through to the moment at which Fridays either run in the normal way or , due to a lack of interest , they are

Nor can I fail to mention the fact , which has already been referred to here , that the saboteurs of this morning' s sitting did not take part in the vote ,
As we can see , however , when we take a decision here on an issue related to storms , disasters or Europe' s interests , that is , serious matters , they are no
Almost none of the 32 gladiators were present for the final vote , which is utterly deplorable and which clearly reveals the true intentions of those who destabilised this morning'
Mr President , I would like to say to Mr Daul and Mrs Lulling that , in debates on the Rules of Procedure , you must always bear in mind that there are
I therefore thought to myself that a warning shot was in order; what then happened I thought went too far and I did not want to fall into line
I consider that , by exhorting our colleagues , and also the Groups , to be present , we should try to rescue these Friday debates and these Friday votes and to bring about
Commissioner , with regard to the forestry issue , I would like to say that , although your openness has sometimes made your words difficult to accept , you have , at least , been
I sincerely feel that your approach is far more beneficial to the credibility of the European Union than the tone of the declarations made when the issue first arose ,
The subject of the forestry sector is now open to debate , and we must take up the issue of natural disasters as well , for we cannot endeavour to draw closer
to our citizens and then explain to them that we are unable to help them when they are in trouble , while , at the same time , we are sending task forces
I would like to express my support for the comments of Mr Daul , who worked together with Evelyne Gebhardt to draft this resolution on the timber industry , and to express
Petty games which are not acknowledged , moreover , for although , effectively , the right does exist to request that the quorum be tested and also to bring up the issue of
We do , however , have one small consolation in that it will not be long before their refusal to participate affects those who were conspicuous by their absence today and
I call upon Parliament' s Bureau to charge the relevant Committee to examine the Rules of Procedure and any practices of the European Parliament which might penalise Friday morning
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate you on the way in which you have conducted this difficult session and I would just like to say something factual to
However , I would like to say to Mr Meijer that at some point it was also decided that we would pass legislative resolutions from Tuesday to Thursday and not on
Fridays , for which the quorum is not prescribed as compulsory , when we would deal with issues which are not controversial so that resolutions which are not controversial , but important nevertheless ,
We should therefore be able to pass them peacefully and in a dignified manner , and that is why , at the end of the day , we have passed them peacefully

If we do that , we could vote on Thursday at midday
(DE) Mr President , yes , of course , we can have the vote on Thursday afternoon
we are not going to manage with the time available
We would be very satisfied if it were possible to discuss Mr Lehne's report on Thursday morning and to vote on it at noon

)
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has asked that Mr Gahler's report on budget aid to developing countries be moved to Wednesday evening

to be debated on Wednesday evening
We would like the Gahler report to be debated that evening as well
We have informed our group of this , but I do not know whether the rapporteur is aware of this or whether he can manage that time
of Europe's agricultural development , and so , if that were possible , we would be very much in favour of it
Mr Gahler has indicated his agreement , and so the formal requirement has been met
(Parliament adopted the motion
)
- Wednesday:
with a debate to be concluded by motions for a resolution
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group
- Mr President , I should like to speak briefly in support of this motion from the PPE-DE Group and the ALDE Group
Darfur should be a priority debate in Parliament this week and we believe it would be a missed opportunity to delay that debate and resolution until next month
What continues to happen in Darfur is an international scandal in humanitarian terms
focus is on Darfur right now
This Parliament should also be having its say
That is why the PPE-DE Group and , I believe , the ALDE Group are so insistent on a debate as well as a resolution this week
on behalf of the PSE Group
- (NL) Mr President , needless to say , the Social Democrats wholeheartedly endorse the request for a debate on Darfur , since the emergency situation is critical and violations persist
The problem is extensive , and we - the European Union , its Member States , and the European Council - have an important part to play in this
That is why it is important that we have this debate
The problem , though , is vast , and our fellow Member was right to point that out
He made a valid point when he asked the Council and Commission to make a statement
As I understand it , we have to hold a debate on Wednesday evening , and neither the Council nor the Commission will be present or provide a statement
We will be thrashing things out among ourselves , and that will , of course , be very unfortunate
Whilst I , on behalf of the Social Democrats , wholeheartedly support the request , I very much hope that we can also have a serious debate involving the Council and Commission
That is , after all , what gives our debate real substance and political meaning

Given the extraordinarily large number of amendments tabled , it would be appropriate to make use of a rule that was tailor-made for this sort of situation
time
on them
All those amendments that have almost no support would be filtered out and save the rest of us an enormous amount of time
Mr Corbett , this matter was discussed in the Conference of Presidents last week and the majority was against using that procedure
In that case , Mr President , I just wonder when on earth we would ever make use of that rule
It was added to the Rules precisely to save the time of this House in this sort of situation
I must express my surprise at the decision of the Conference of Presidents
You have every right to express your surprise at this decision
or the other
This is a further aspect of the question and one which will certainly be considered in greater depth in future in the light of your remarks
(FR) Mr President , if my memory serves me correctly , the Conference of Presidents objected to the report being referred to committee
However , if I have correctly understood what Mr Corbett just said , this is a different matter
different matter
I do not believe that we spoke of this aspect in the Conference of Presidents
OK , but even that would require a meeting of the committee responsible
not to submit in plenary those that did not receive at least 10% of the votes in committee
If I have understood him correctly , Mr Corbett feels that this requires a meeting to be held in committee tomorrow evening
The problem is that his committee ceased to exist at the end of January
Now , if I am not a complete fool , we are in February , and the mandate given to the committee by Parliament expired at the end of January
Therefore , I should like Mr Corbett to explain to me how a committee can vote on things that no longer exist
In theory , we would need to reinstate this committee , which could then meet tomorrow evening , and sift through the amendments
I really do not care; I am simply saying to you that this is the problem
Mr President , I think the answer is easy: Rule 156 gives complete discretion to the President of our House
than 10% support , then he is free to do so under Rule 156
Rule 156 gives the President enormous power in this respect , even if the Conference of Presidents disagrees with him
and that is why the Conference of Presidents ended up , in agreement with him , deciding as it has done
I think the vast majority of us would like to vote on Wednesday , and that is the idea behind the whole discussion
For the future we will go deeper into the discussion and keep in contact with everybody who might have remarks to make
(The agenda was therefore adopted
)
The final draft of the agenda for this sitting , as agreed by the Conference of Presidents meeting on Thursday , 8 February 2007 , in accordance with Rules 130 and 131 of

As you mentioned , there are two possibilities: Thursday afternoon might well be one of them , but , as there are - or so I gather - fewer Members pressing to
I would only ask , though , that the vote on it should be held this week , since the committees have come to an amicable agreement on this and the Council
If we are to take this legislative report on Thursday afternoon , it would probably not be advisable to vote on it at the same time , and hence my request
There is a reason why I find Wednesday problematic , and it is that I gather that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats would
like to have Darfur put on the agenda , the plan being , I believe , for this to be discussed on Wednesday evening , but we would like to have the Gahler report
moved to Wednesday , on the grounds that a large number of Members have indicated their desire to speak to the reports by Mrs Batzeli , Mr Goepel and Mrs Hall , so
- (DE) Mr President , as I have just explained , I am working on the assumption that Darfur - which also has to do with development issues - is going
The fact is that we will be having a lot of speakers to the other reports , particularly to Mrs Batzeli's , wine being such an important subject , especially in terms
The Group of the European People's Party and the Group of the Liberals have requested the inclusion of statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Darfur ,
The Council has today released its conclusions on Sudan and the UN Human Rights Council is trying to get an assessment mission into Darfur as we speak , so the international
Mr President , may I enquire why you have not made use of Rule 156 of the Rules of Procedure in relation to the reports from the Temporary Committee on the
Rule 156 was added to the Rules of Procedure in the reform three years ago in order to provide a filter when we are faced with a very long voting
This would enable the committee concerned to vote and to see which amendments have a sufficient degree of support to merit this House's time being used up in voting
There are two aspects: first , the majority in the Conference of Presidents; and then , regardless of that majority , the fact that the President can take a decision one way
If I have understood him correctly , he is proposing not to submit to the vote amendments that received an extremely low number of votes in committee , which is a
(FR) Mr President , I understood what Mr Corbett was proposing , and that was for the committee to meet tomorrow evening in order to sift through the 180 amendments , so as
If he chooses to reconvene the committee at a special meeting tomorrow to filter the amendments so that we here only need to vote on those that get more
That is , in principle , the case , but the President does of course regard the consent of the majority in this House as important , especially when dealing with such thorny issues ,

EC-Ukraine agreement for scientific and technological cooperation (
Entry into force on 1 August 2010 of the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) and the role of the EU (debate)
2010 of the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) and the role of the EU
Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy
- Madam President , I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to discuss the issue of cluster munitions
I believe this is an important moment to do so , less than one month before the entry into force of the Convention on Cluster Munitions
As this House knows , this Convention , originally a Norwegian initiative , will prohibit all use , stockpiling , production and transfer of cluster munitions
Similarly to anti-personnel landmines , cluster munitions pose - as honourable Members know - a serious threat to the lives of civilians by causing indiscriminate damage , particularly affecting children
The very nature of cluster munitions goes against basic humanitarian principles
time , even decades after a conflict has ended
That is why the European Union is committed to making every effort to achieve a complete ban on these deadly devices
The Convention on Cluster Munitions was agreed in December 2008
In only a year and a half , 106 states have signed the convention and 36 have ratified it
our common efforts to reduce - and eventually eliminate - the production , use and transfer of cluster munitions
The European Union as a whole is fully committed to tackling the impact of cluster munitions on civilian populations through all possible means
Although not all EU Member States are party to the convention , there is a general understanding that the EU can , and must , play an active role in this area
Conventional Weapons
The aim here is to expand the body of international norms spanning this category of weapons and to reach out to a large number of countries
I think we can be very clear on this point
The Convention on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons is a UN Convention and therefore , a truly multilateral instrument , negotiated in the widest forum
Its provisions , and those of its additional protocols , contribute to reducing the suffering of combatants and civilian populations in areas of conflict
It is therefore very important that the EU supports this convention and its protocols
This is exactly what we have been doing since 2007 through a specific EU joint action that supports the universalisation of the convention and its full implementation
of certain cluster munitions that cause particular humanitarian concerns
objectives
Laos in November 2010
The Santiago conference in June already demonstrated a high level of commitment from large numbers of states , as indeed was the case for representatives of civil society
Many EU Member States played a very active role as Friends of the Chair in the discussions
With respect to concrete assistance to third countries , let me emphasise that the European Union has been very active
such as Afghanistan , Laos , Cambodia , Lebanon or Sudan
- including , sadly , the daily threat posed by cluster munitions
I very much look forward to this debate
Madam President , thank you , Baroness Ashton , for your sympathetic words
I agree wholeheartedly with what you have said and believe that we should emphasise what the European Union has achieved in the area of eliminating these weapons
War and civil war are always the worst case scenario , particularly for the people affected by them
However , within this worst case scenario , there is another type of weapon which is even more perfidious , and which has a particularly destructive , long-term effect , namely cluster munitions
who have not yet signed or ratified this convention to do so as soon as possible , let us say , by the end of the year
Although it would have been wonderful , I assume that we will not manage this by 1 August , because some national parliaments are already in recess
We have touched on another point , namely , the demand that the European Union , which is now a legal personality , should sign up to this convention
Perhaps this is a way to encourage the remaining Member States to take the same step on a bilateral basis
and to eliminate cluster munitions in the countries where they still exist as quickly as possible
Madam President , Baroness Ashton , cluster munitions destroy lives and the environment in a disproportionate and immoral way , without distinguishing between military and civilian targets in theatres of armed conflict
The idea that these arms provide security for the states that own them is false and backward and violates international humanitarian law and interferes with global security
Moreover , the principal victims of these weapons are developing countries and their people
The Convention on Cluster Munitions obliges States Parties to gradually destroy their stockpiled weapons and to be responsible for disposing of unexploded munitions and for protecting and supporting their victims
The convention enters into force on 1 August , but only 11 EU Member States have ratified it so far
succeed in prohibiting and eliminating them
Another nine EU Member States have already expressed their approval of the convention , but they have yet to ratify it
My country , Portugal , was one of those that allowed itself to become bound up in lengthy legislation after signing the convention in December 2008
Almost two years later , the Assembly of the Republic has still not been called upon to give their decision
announced their ratification for August , when the convention enters into force , before Portugal itself
These delays in ratifying the convention are unacceptable
Convention on Cluster Munitions , as provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon
The European Union must be at the forefront of this process , and the seven Member States which have not even signed the Convention must be called to account
This resolution by the European Parliament , whereby we name them , is a step towards this
on behalf of the ALDE Group
- Madam President , cluster bombs have killed and injured thousands of civilians during the last 40 years and sadly continue to do so today
We must remember that a third of all recorded cluster munitions casualties are children
Take the case of a Vietnamese girl helping her father with the gardening one day
She was the victim of a cluster bomb and lost both her legs
The tragedy is that she was considered lucky: four out of ten cluster bomb accidents result in death
After years of campaigning , we finally now have a convention which can help to deliver change
It is absolutely vital , first and foremost , that all EU Member States sign and ratify the convention as a matter of urgency
Sadly , as Mrs Gomes says and as this resolution states , only 11 Member States have ratified the convention so far
EU Member States to sign and ratify it
EU Member States that have signed should work quickly to put into place national legislation to implement it and destroy their stockpiles , as Spain has already done
In 2002 , I was Parliament's rapporteur for its report on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities , which was adopted in 2006
The EU will soon sign this landmark convention
It will be a total contradiction if we then failed to take action on cluster bombs
countries
I would like to hear the High Representative's plans to take this forward
and psychological support
Also important , as the High Representative has mentioned , is the clearance of the millions of unexploded cluster munition remnants that are left behind after conflicts
the clearance of those munitions
We must do all we can to save the lives of thousands who have yet to be killed and injured and to help those who have been
We know enough about the horrific effects of these weapons to know that even those who have not signed the convention should never ever use them again
I urge you all to support this resolution
the Austrian Parliament , of which I was then a Member , asking us to organise an event around the issue in order to get the convention off the ground
The group included victims , people who themselves had lost a leg or had suffered other serious health problems because of cluster munitions
They showed us photographs illustrating what happens when a bomb of this type detonates
Hundreds of tiny , coloured fragments are produced that are then left lying about , possibly for years - hence the term cluster munitions
them to lose an arm or a leg
to sign and ratify the convention
That is all very well , but so many of the Member States of the European Union have still not signed up
some points of concern within your group
yet prepared actually to destroy their stockpiles and to declare that they will never use these weapons again
third countries , you should add the prohibition of cluster bombs and cluster munitions to the standard clause which already includes the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
I would ask that you answer these questions
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
- (DE) Madam President , I would like to thank the previous speakers for their contributions , which I expressly support
As already explained , cluster munitions are indeed among the most brutal weapons in existence
They were certainly still in use by some EU Member States and the USA until recently
I could mention the former Yugoslavia , Iraq , Afghanistan and Yemen
It is quite shocking that - as has already been stated - statistically , the victims of cluster bombs and cluster munitions are 98% civilians , 27% of whom are children
How are we to view the prospects for the continued use of these weapons
It is certainly remarkable that Deutsche Bank is investing in the production of these dreadful weapons through its subsidiaries
It has been proven that business relations exist between Deutsche Bank and leading suppliers and manufacturers of cluster munitions , including L-3 Communications and Lockheed Martin
I find it shameless and inhumane to knowingly seek to make money from the death of civilians
The use , production , storage and transport of these weapons must be prohibited; the same goes for the trade in such weapons
this is not possible , as Mr Gahler has stated , they must do so at the earliest possible opportunity
destroy the existing stockpiles of cluster munitions
Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left
We believe that this resolution represents a major success in the fight against these murderous weapons
of cluster munitions
No one disagrees that our ambition must be for all the Member States to ratify this convention
Of course , the question arises as to why the other Member States have not yet ratified the convention , despite the fact that it enters into force on 1 August
increased aggression
also convince neighbouring countries demonstrating tension and aggression to move in the same direction , especially those who want to join our European family
(SK) Cluster munitions are among the most dangerous weapons for civilians because they are used over extensive areas against scattered , mobile targets that are difficult to see
As has already been said , up to 98% of the victims are people not involved in military conflict , in other words , civilians
A large proportion of them - 27% - are also children
ended
own economic - and this is very sad - their own economic interests in relation to the production and export of these munitions
Madam President , I profoundly disagree with such an approach , and I believe that humanitarian interests and the protection of civilians should come first
on Cluster Munitions
Madam President , this evening , we have spent some time discussing what you might call the dark side of modern life
A few moments ago , we were discussing the destruction of life throughout the world because of HIV/AIDS; now we have the same destruction of innocent civilians by cluster munitions
these terrible problems
good enough
So the High Representative will have to use her influence to ask the others: 'Why not
' Then try to eliminate the barriers to their signing up
Only then can we move forward with what we spoke about today , the European Union speaking with one voice to the rest of the world
Lisbon Treaty has created new instruments and that we are going to lead in terms of giving a good example all around the world
So , put our house in order first , and then we can deal with the rest of the world
Baroness Ashton , how are you going to ensure that the 16 countries ratify before 1 August
Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy
- Madam President , this has been a very important debate , and I have taken note of your remarks and , of course , your concern
of the Convention on Cluster Munitions and of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons
We will also continue to provide international cooperation and assistance by mainstreaming our activities against cluster munitions in our development and in our cooperation policies
If I might address two or three of the key points that have also been raised in this debate
their remit
Members are absolutely right to raise that as an issue that we will need to consider very carefully
therefore eight Member States who have done neither at this stage
Members have made their positions very clear in wanting to see as many EU Member States as possible continue to take forward both the ratification and the signing
we do to support third countries as part of the mainstreaming of our policies - this whole post-Lisbon opportunity - to bring together different policies
the reasons , as Ms Lunacek vividly described , of what happens when these brightly coloured bomblets appear on the ground
There are many cases , particularly of children who have been devastated either by the loss of limbs or , occasionally , loss of life as a consequence
for example , in Lebanon or Sri Lanka , and also to make sure that we are dealing with issues on emerging crises as well
I have mentioned that we spend about EUR 330 million in our commitment to support countries that have been directly affected by mines and cluster munitions
I described Afghanistan , where we have spent EUR 22 million , and Lebanon (EUR 7 million) , and future projects in Bosnia and Herzegovina , Laos and Cambodia are under preparation
during operations on the ground , we do not make distinctions between what we clear
The point is that we clear it and that , I hope , will be well understood by Members
The final point I wanted to make is that we are trying to ensure that we assist and support the timely signature and ratification of the convention by Member States
of what I described earlier as the first states-party meeting , are regularly discussed
progress when we have that first states-party meeting
Though the hour is late , this has been an extremely important debate and I am very grateful for the contributions that have been made
I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure
The debate is closed
The vote will take place on Thursday , 8 July 2010
Written statements (Rule 149)
in writing
Forces in Europe , I have to admit that this idea is ahead of its time and I must therefore abstain
Ceterum censeo , France has decided to sell a Mistral class warship to Russia; we believe that it will sincerely regret its action
The next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the entry into force on 1 August
Not only do they release small bomblets over a wide area with indiscriminate effects , they also leave behind a large amount of unexploded ordnance that can explode at any
In a way that reminds us of the inspiring dynamic triggered by the entry into force of the Ottawa Convention on Anti-Personnel Landmines , we can expect significant progress in
As this House knows , the EU also continues to support the wider negotiation of an additional protocol on cluster munitions to the UN Convention on the Use of Certain
In the negotiations on the additional protocol on cluster munitions , the EU is pleading for a prohibition and not only a restriction of the use , production , transfer and stockpiling
I recognise that the scope of this protocol could not be as wide as the Convention on Cluster Munitions , but if we could achieve a protocol in the UN context
with wider participation - in particular , with the participation of those states that produce and have stocks of these weapons - it would help us to get closer to our
As for the next steps on the Convention on Cluster Munitions as such , I am pleased that preparations have begun for the first states-party meeting , which will take place in
We assist third countries in getting rid of their stockpile of cluster munitions , we help them to clear affected areas , and we provide assistance to the victims in countries
Over the last 10 years , the European Union has devoted more than EUR 300 million to its work in the field of anti-personnel landmines and explosive remnants of war
That is why it is important that we should be able to state that this convention will come into force on 1 August , on the one hand , while , on the
other , taking this as the right opportunity for the European Parliament to play a special role by putting our own house in order , specifically by calling on those Member States
I hope that in this way , we will soon make the European Union and its Member States into an example for third countries , encouraging them to destroy their stocks
It is urgent that all Member States do so , so that we can make an effective contribution to curbing the use , sale and transfer of these weapons everywhere and
This tardiness is all the more embarrassing given that Portugal is positively committed to promoting the convention alongside other Portuguese-speaking countries , and now Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde have
This is why we are also asking the High Representative for Foreign Affairs , Mrs Ashton , to speed up the process so that the European Union can accede to the
As we move towards the entry into force of this convention on 1 August , I would like to see a concerted effort by Parliament and the Commission to convince all
Looking to the future , it is important as well that the Commission and the Council include a ban on cluster munitions in a standard clause in agreements with third
The convention also establishes a new humanitarian standard for the assistance of victims in Article 5 , calling for guidelines and good practice , including in the areas of medical care , rehabilitation
Article 6 of the convention calls for each country to provide assistance for clearance and destruction of cluster munition remnants and information concerning various means and technologies related to
Madam President , Baroness Ashton , ladies and gentlemen , my first encounter with the issue of cluster munitions was more than four years ago , when a group of civil society organisations approached
Children playing on the site at a later time can be attracted by the bright colours , picking the fragments up only for them to explode in their hand , causing
This made such an impression on me that I started a campaign in Austria and I can say that , after some initial resistance , my country was one of the first
I am very pleased that we have succeeded in convincing a majority - five groups - to support this resolution , particularly because I know , Mr Gahler , that there were
I would also like to thank you for agreeing to the naming of the Member States who have not yet signed and ratified the convention and who are not
Baroness Ashton , I have two specific questions for you: the demand that the EU should sign up to this convention as a legal entity and that , in all negotiations with
For this reason , all EU Member States , along with all other countries , must sign and ratify the agreement on cluster munitions in full by August of this year or , if
There should also be a moratorium on the use , production and distribution of cluster munitions until the agreement is ratified and work should begin as quickly as possible to
I am very pleased with this cross-party cooperation and support for the agreement on cluster munitions in the form of this joint resolution and welcome it on behalf of the
(EL) Madam President , indeed , as my honourable friends have said , only 11 Member States out of 27 have ratified this very important convention banning the use , production , storage and transportation
The main causes are reasons of national security and , to a great extent , in certain instances , they are justified , especially where neighbouring states outside the European Union are demonstrating
Therefore , to close , if we really want all the Member States to ratify this convention and to have the maximum possible results in these very important Union policies , we must
In addition , perhaps 30% of cluster bombs do not explode but remain in the earth in the form of mines , posing a danger to civilians long after the conflict has
Despite these sad statistics , many Member States of the European Union have not signed the Convention on Cluster Munitions , which bans their production , storage and use , because they follow their
In my opinion , it is therefore the task of the European Union to put pressure on all states , and particularly on EU Member States , to sign and ratify the Convention
It is good I suppose , with new instruments being made available with the Lisbon Treaty , through Baroness Ashton as High Representative , to at least try and bring solutions for
However , we will have to put our own house in order first and , as the speakers have said , only 11 of the 27 have signed the convention , which is not
If we cannot speak with one voice by putting our own house in order first , how can we go to the rest of the world saying that a new
Let me begin by saying that the European Union will maintain its engagement to attain a complete ban on cluster munitions through our active political outreach in the framework both
First of all , the decision on accession to the convention by the European Union in the post-Lisbon era , of course , depends on the Member States , because it comes within
If I can say , though , that the position , as I understand it , of a number of Member States is that we have 11 Member States who have ratified as well
as signed the convention , but we have a further eight Member States who have signed it but not yet ratified it - so that is 19 Member States - and
I also want to address briefly the point that Ms Lynne made about assistance to third countries and , as I said in my earlier remarks , the importance of bringing what
We want to continue actively , through the external action instruments that we have , to contribute to the disposal of unexploded ordnances , anti-personnel mines and abandoned ammunition stocks precisely for
We mostly make use of our geographical instruments in response to the needs that are expressed by our partner countries , and we also make use of the humanitarian aid instruments ,
I also want to make the point that , although I have given that figure , it is difficult to quantify the exact figures for our programmes , and the reason is that
We have coordination meetings among EU disarmament experts which take place every month , and the issue of the universality of the convention , as well as the state of preparedness
We have decided to contribute to the greatest extent possible to the preparatory committee to be held in September in Geneva , in order to ensure that we get good
- I fully support the initiative not to use cluster munitions but , coming from a country whose neighbour does not follow the conditions of the Treaty on Conventional Armed

A European strategy on the Roma (vote)
- Before the vote on Amendment 9
(IT) Mr President , I wanted to remove the words 'traditional practices' from the oral amendment , that is , the last two words of paragraph 9
If you wish I can read the text that remains: 'calls on the Roma to respect human rights , in particular with regard to women and children , avoiding forced marriages'
(The oral amendment was accepted

Restoring NTDTV Television broadcasts to China via Eutelsat (written declaration)
- (IT) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , thank you on behalf of those who supported this initiative
I would like to thank the more than 440 members who added their signatures
This Parliament requests Eutelsat to restore NTDTV broadcasts in China: the freedom to obtain information and knowledge is a basic human right
over human rights , we do this to promote the freedom of the Chinese people
This Parliament is demonstrating , as it has done over the Sakharov Prize , Hu Jia and the invitation to the Dalai Lama , that when we criticise China or the EU
Announcement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen , that brings me to the statement on Strasbourg
The Bureau considered the matter yesterday
Various repairs are still being carried out in Strasbourg
as is the case: thus the September II part-session will take place here in Brussels as well
(Applause)
are looking into that
We want to have the same safety standards here in Brussels as we have in Strasbourg , and I can assure you that safety will always be paramount
As things stand at present , the final inspection by the experts will take place on 22 September
That allows enough time for a decision on the October part-session to be taken
I would like to wish you a safe and pleasant stay here in Brussels , and as lunchtime is approaching , let me also wish you bon app√©tit
The Bureau adopted a unanimous decision yesterday evening - also at Mr Fazakas's suggestion - which we intend to publish now that the Conference of Presidents has been informed ,

Violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo
Mr President , the Presidency attaches great importance to discussing with the European Parliament the highly problematic situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo
Infringements of human rights , and particularly increased sexual and gender-related violence , are a huge problem
It is high time for a debate on the situation in the country , particularly in view of the recent UN report
within the European Union
I do not need to remind you of the EU's long-term commitment to the Democratic Republic of Congo and the entire African Great Lakes Region
The EU has long made efforts to bring about peace and stability in the country
It is important that this commitment continues , both politically and in terms of development
I am sure that the Commission will say more about this later
This support has been manifested in various ways , including the appointment of the first EU Special Representative for the region as far back as 1994
Both military and civil ESDP instruments have been used
of the defence forces and EUPOL RD Congo for reform of the police
Bearing all this in mind , there have been both positive and negative developments
Diplomatic relations between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda have been restored
That is to be welcomed
Peace agreements with most of the armed groups in the eastern part of the country were signed in 2008 and 2009
These now have to be implemented
The situation is unstable in many ways
Many armed groups in the east are in the process of being integrated into the army and some uncertainty pervades this integration work
Military operations are continuing against other armed groups , including the FDLR and the Lord's Resistance Army
These groups are directly responsible for targeting civilians and for an enormous amount of human suffering
At the same time , armed groups are re-emerging in other parts of the country
The eastern part of the country remains an area in which international law and human rights are being infringed
There are high levels of murder , acts of violence and sexual attacks
These crimes are spreading throughout the country on an alarming scale , despite President Kabila's announcement of a so-called zero tolerance policy
The illegal exploitation of natural resources is a further major problem
cut off economic support to illegal armed groups
The Council is also concerned about the preparatory work and arrangements for the planned local elections
Management problems , insufficient transparency and infringements of citizens' and political rights represent serious obstacles to the democratisation process
rights in North Kivu and South Kivu
justice
The EU is firmly committed to continuing to help bring about peace , stability and development for the population of the country
In this regard , reform of the security sector is crucial to the country's stabilisation
All players within this sector , including the Congolese authorities , must strive to ensure that the common interest in reform of the security sector is genuinely safeguarded
We must also encourage continued specific improvements in regional relations through firmer political and economic partnerships between the countries of the region
I can assure you that the Council and the European Union will stand by its commitment to the Democratic Republic of Congo and is concerned about its future
We will continue our wide-ranging commitment in the country and will continue to speak plainly wherever international law and human rights are infringed
debate
the Congolese authorities and the international community
Every effort has been made to prevent the worst
short term , to defuse the ticking time bomb of violence , although its potential for destabilisation today remains intact
It remains intact because the underlying causes have been addressed superficially and on the basis of a short-term , purely political rationale
Being faced with only poor solutions , the international community has opted for the least serious one; that is not a criticism , just an obvious fact , an observation
The international community and the European Union have been unable to take the decision to deploy a protection force
The MONUC reinforcements that we have been requesting for over a year now are only just starting to arrive
be ignored or passed over in silence
It is time now to address and to deal with these underlying causes , and to come up with lasting solutions
United Nations , the rest of the international community and the European Union in the second instance
exists on both sides , can help establish a situation of peaceful coexistence and profitable cooperation between the two countries within a revitalised Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries
However , this is only the start of what remains a long and problematic journey
representatives who are often part of the problem
The Rwanda-DRC agreement has meant that the CNDP and the unacceptable demands of Laurent Nkunda have been temporarily brought under control
immunity , which is in violation of all the international provisions on crimes against humanity and which neither Rwanda nor the DRC are entitled or able to grant him
liable to create even more serious problems than those which we faced a year ago - problems that neither Rwanda nor the DRC will be capable of managing any longer
of sexual atrocities , the impunity for all manner of crimes , and the pillaging of natural resources
One need only read the United Nations and the Human Rights Watch reports that I mentioned to understand the scale of this never-ending tragedy
to minimise the risks that military pressure entails for innocent civilians
This requires better planning , the redefining of priorities and greater protection of the populations by MONUC , which is the main task stipulated in its mandate
The conditions in which MONUC may operate must also be clear and unambiguous
This is not about calling for MONUC to withdraw or disengage
of the Congolese disease , prove this
Member States
those who are directly or indirectly associated with it must be treated
This is why a firmer stance is needed against all forms of trafficking
not necessarily criminals
That being said , the solution to a large part of the problem must also be found in the DRC
I am , of course , thinking of the local origins of the conflict
hand
This is absolutely essential if the stabilisation efforts and the will to revive economic activity in the Kivus are to succeed
At that point , the international community really will have a role to play
However , the Kivus aside , I am also thinking of the huge mess that the DRC has become over the last 20 years or so
It is a country in which practically everything needs to be rebuilt , starting with the state , the absence of which is at the heart of all the problems
In order to achieve this task , certain elements are crucial
Firstly , democracy must be consolidated
I am , of course , thinking of the local , legislative and presidential elections announced for 2011
Elections are one element of democracy , but we must not forget the need to continue to support the political institutions and forces in a dialectic relationship with the opposition
Without this , we would not be operating in a truly open political system
The second element is without doubt the need to strengthen good governance
to have a chance of success
Parliament raised the issue of impunity
This is a good example , because it is a matter of political will and it also underpins the whole business of affirming the rule of law
The problem is that things cannot be done in isolation
The rule of law also requires a reform of the security sector and real progress in economic governance terms
The scale of the challenges implies the need for long-term policies
However , that must not be an excuse for any lack of immediate action
I am thinking in particular of the issues of sexual violence and human rights , which Parliament has highlighted
Political will can play a crucial role here , and in this regard , we must welcome the commitment made by President Kabila to take a zero tolerance approach
This approach must now be applied
The Commission , which , by the way , is already doing a great deal of work in this area (supporting the judiciary , helping victims) , is prepared to continue to support the DRC
sexual violence
A consolidated democratic system , good governance and political will: those are the key elements on which we would like to build our partnership as equals with the DRC
Mr President , practically every journalist who writes about Africa would like to be the next Joseph Conrad
This is why journalists most often concentrate on unfavourable aspects , because they are looking for the heart of darkness
However , Congo does not have to be a heart of darkness
It can be a normal country
sex is associated with love and not rape and violence
I am certain that the key to success in Kivu and the whole of Congo is the quality of government
Without democratic , just , honest and effective government , peace and justice cannot be achieved
Without responsible government , the country's riches serve only a few , leaders look after themselves , schools are empty and violence becomes a part of everyday life
I remember the optimism of 2006
important country
However , our optimism has turned out to be premature
It is hard not to ask the question why this has happened , and why the elections did not result in a better life for Congo
In my opinion , it is a question of money , as Mrs Malmstr√∂m and Mr De Gucht have said
They spoke about the illegal use of resources and how this is used to finance arms , which serves to continue and escalate the conflict
If we can put a stop to this , we will be closer to our goal
on behalf of the S&D Group
- Mr President , I thank the Commissioner for his statement , which certainly reassures me
of political will , and we need political leadership to resolve this according to international obligations as well as according to the rule of law
Let me just deal with the reality of this
In the conflict since 1998 , over 5 000 400 people have lost their lives and , indirectly or directly , as many as 45 000 deaths occur every month
voice , those who suffer such violence
The armed actors in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have perpetrated gender-based violence through various forms , including sexual slavery , kidnapping , forced recruitment , forced prostitution and rape
The Congolese victims of sexual violence include women , men and boys who have also suffered rape , sexual humiliation and genital mutilation
Resolution after resolution has been passed
The time has come for us internationally to demand an end to these atrocities
Congo
deeply concerning
I would like to make seven observations
The first is that peace certainly cannot be established in the east of Congo until the FDLR are prevented from doing harm
sources of income are the civilian populations , who are victims of collateral damage but also of the condemnation of some and the violent acts of others
with all the requests and its organisation on the ground is also not always ideal
that could be used by certain negative forces as an excuse to demonise it
Clearly , that would be even more serious
Another element concerns the acts of violence by the FARDC
to those Congolese units that fail to respect human rights
The zero tolerance policy recently introduced by President Kabila clearly must be welcomed , but whether it is respected and implemented or not is another matter
The shortcomings of the Congolese judicial system are creating a widespread feeling of impunity
east
Lastly , my final point: the one thing that still has to be rebuilt in Congo is a rule of law with real governing powers
Today , these powers are completely non-existent and thus create an extremely serious vacuum
Mr President , Mrs Malmstr√∂m , Commissioner , as you have both said , the situation in the Kivu region is extremely worrying , despite the presence of almost 20 000 MONUC troops
Congolese army , which have made systematic rape a weapon of war
scandalous strategy
The pillaging of resources , as you said , Commissioner , is another factor that is exacerbating this conflict
eyes of the populations , who are already worn out by so many years of war and massacres
I entirely agree that it is not MONUC's mandate that must be reviewed and that it should obviously not be asked to withdraw
men in its ranks who violate human rights or commit acts of violence
Court
These same authorities must also ensure that the soldiers are quartered in barracks immediately
If they were quartered in barracks , things would no doubt be different
Lastly , I believe that we must revisit the Amani programme
This programme offers the possibility of building a dialogue and peace everywhere , since these alone are the guarantees of lasting reconstruction
In any case , I welcome your intervention , which I broadly support , and I hope that the European Union will remain active
This is crucial , even though , regrettably , it did not want to put a force together
That would have been a possibility a little less than a year ago
Nevertheless , I believe that European Union action is crucial
Mr President , in no other country in the world have there , as yet , been more European Security and Defence Policy operations than in the Democratic Republic of Congo
As always , the question arises of whose security is being defended
Is it the security of the Congolese civilian population , the women and children
forces supported by the EU were involved
So what is being defended in the Congo
Humanity
international NGOs to be acceptable from the point of view of the Congolese people
President Kabila changed course for a while and concluded fewer contracts with Western firms
This change was suspended when the war escalated once again
Germany
I am referring here to the resolution that I have tabled on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left
world
The Congo operation was decided on ten years ago , but nothing much has been achieved
Militias continue to plunder the rich supply of natural resources in the region , terrorise the inhabitants and commit crimes against humanity
Embargoes have been ineffective so far
Rebels are simply changing sides and they carry out their crimes in the safe uniforms of Congolese soldiers
least
We also succeeded in striking a small blow against the global Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda (FDLR)
However , we have not been able to put an end to the cruel civil war
The fronts are always changing
It is particularly disturbing when accusations made against the UN mission turn out to be true
human rights violations
The Congo mission simply must not turn into some kind of Vietnam for Europe
Essentially , we need a coordinated European security policy and peace-keeping operations , but above all , in the area surrounding Europe and not in far-off Africa , where the ethnic fronts are unclear
In my opinion , the EU must concentrate its peace-keeping operations on the crisis regions in its own backyard , such as the Balkans or the Caucasus
Therefore , we should , perhaps , end the EU's involvement in the UN mission in Africa
Mr President , that the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is deplorable and that the effect of the conflict upon the people there is tragic goes without saying
However , there are a number of important points that must be reiterated here and in our joint motion for a resolution
poverty
Fighting over territory , ethnicity , resources or politics are but branches of the same rotten tree of want
Increase a man's prosperity and give him purpose and you will reduce his desire to kill or be killed
That is our development challenge as a Parliament
Secondly , we must ensure that any military presence in a foreign country is designed and implemented to reduce suffering and violence , not exacerbate it
We must stand as pillars against impunity rather than agents of it
If there is evidence that Western missions are not living up to this standard , then their presence and practices must be urgently reassessed
Finally , history has shown us that , in internecine conflicts such as in the DRC , a political solution is the only hope for peace
Dialogue and engagement are the only roads toward such a solution
of peace
(RO) As has been emphasised so far , millions of civilians have been deliberately killed during military operations in the eastern part of the Republic of Congo
There is a risk of this kind of news becoming quite routine due to the unprecedented frequency with which acts of violence are committed in this country
The victims of these actions include children , young girls and women , not to mention civilians involved in protecting human rights and journalists
The humanitarian crisis is deepening with every day that passes
The lack of security in the area means that humanitarian organisations can no longer provide any intervention
the whole of last year
All these incidents have taken place against a backdrop of famine and extreme poverty affecting millions of people
The blame for this whole tragedy lies both with the Congolese army and Rwandan rebels
take place
been assigned them
Congo every year , with a value in excess of EUR 1 billion
The money from this is used to procure weapons and encourage crime in this country
give up and concentrate on our own neighbours
I must say that , if one really looks at the situation , one is almost tempted to call it a day
adopt yet another resolution and consider our job done
hold such a debate
The resolution contains very many positive elements , and I hope that we shall indeed lend force to them with action , but I just wanted to emphasise one aspect
We frequently talk about rape , or sexual violence , but in fact , these terms scarcely cover the reality of the situation
its fabric
them and are not leaving them in the lurch; that we are shouldering our moral responsibility
on the international community's actions in light of the situation on the ground in the RDC , which is , unfortunately , continuing to deteriorate
humanitarian terms is high and if it is paid through the suffering of the Congolese civilian population
humanitarian crisis
On the other hand , impunity offers an invitation to commit these crimes over and over again
I believe that protection of the civilian population must be the number one priority
immediately , along with the climate of impunity
(ES) Mr President , other Members have already spoken of the tragic situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo
They have spoken of the millions of deaths and cases of rape and abuse against the civilian population
They have spoken of the United Nations Organisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) and of cooperation by the European Commission on the ground
Less has been said , however , about the need to control the illegal flow of raw materials , such as diamonds , gold and other products , to the rest of the world
These products are being 'laundered' through legitimate accounts and companies in our own countries or in the United States
This is important work for Mrs Ashton
of action to prevent this wealth from ending up in the hands of the warlords who are responsible for the killing and rape
regard to Congo - seems to me to be an immediate requirement
Everything must be done to ensure the protection of the civilian populations
of violence can be stemmed
For many years now , international communities , NGOs and Congolese women have made constant efforts to combat the use of sexual assault as a weapon of war
Today , systematic and widespread use is made of this weapon in peaceful areas , and always with total impunity
violence , without exception , will have to answer for their actions - and truly effective
to identify all the culprits so that they can be sentenced without delay
of human rights and , hence , of the rights of women and children , whose dignity , childhood and innocence are often sacrificed on the altar of another form of humiliation: indifference
as we now know
the rebel armed groups , operations which left countless massacres and human rights violations in their wake
Sexual violence is a very disturbing and very widespread trend , and is now part of everyday life for the people of Congo
What is more , numerous acts of violence are being committed against humanitarian workers
According to official figures , there are 2 113 000 displaced persons in the east of the Republic of Congo
the eastern province
Currently , it is estimated that humanitarian aid is required for almost 350 000 vulnerable people: children , widows and victims of sexual violence
A rapid response by the European Union is therefore crucial
of that country
They have talked about the rapes and the barbaric acts that these people suffer and about the murders of which they are victims
Rather than talk about them , however , I invite you to visit the UNICEF and V-Day websites , which obviously say all there is to say about this subject
and whose unborn children will never be able to contribute to it either
community - one , in short , of a country that is getting into more and more of a mess
against Congolese women and , more broadly speaking , if they ensure that a genuine rule of law is established in that country
east of the country
The phenomenon is not new
It is extremely complex
It is multidimensional
The physical and psychological suffering of the victims is made even worse by this social exclusion , which is tragic for them
President Kabila's zero tolerance policy is today tentatively beginning to bear fruit , but everyone is aware that only a global strategy can combat this scourge in the long term
I know , Commissioner , that the Commission is already intervening , and is doing so via a multitude of projects and budgets , too
about the results of this strategy
Women , Commissioner , are the main vehicle for peace and reconstruction in a country
They are the future of Congo
How do you intend to act more effectively and more promptly
(FR) Mr President , I , too , wished to speak in this debate , since it concerns a subject that I have been following for a long time
the massacres , the crimes against humanity and the acts of sexual violence committed against women and girls that are still taking place in the eastern province
against the civilian populations in the eastern province of the DRC
women and girls and the enlistment of child soldiers
and its ravaged people
In addition , the leader of the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda was arrested
These are both signs of improvement in the situation in eastern Congo
My question for the Commission is this: what measures are you intending to take to bring about further rapprochement between Congo and Rwanda
With regard to the UN mandate , a great deal has been said here today about taking all forms of action
the women and children of this country
should be consistent and , if need be - including for the protection of the oppressed people - those on the ground must be armed
Afghanistan and now in the Congo
But , nevertheless , that is the reality
At the same time , taking the message of the festive season of peace and goodwill , we must , as my colleague Mr Mitchell put it so well , become sponsors of peace
been done before , to bring these countries to order and to try and alleviate the terrible suffering in these places
is really the way to peace in the long term
the Congo
They did a tremendous job
I am extremely worried about the role of the United Nations troops in the Congo at present: the Moroccans , the Pakistanis and the Indians
We are talking about rape , violence , trading and so on , but the United Nations troops there are not covering themselves in glory and are actually doing a disservice
I agree completely with Mr Mitchell , that the European Union needs to take a firmer hand
We are a European Union , totally united
We did excellent work in Chad
We need our own peacekeepers in there and we cannot rely on the United Nations
The situation is that we have a beautiful people , victims of European colonisation , victims of tribal conflict , victims of international blindness , and we cannot be blind any longer
We simply have to go in and save those people
(SV) Mr President , it is almost impossible to grasp the terrible statistics being mentioned , and yet we know that they are true
strong or as specific as it should be
There has been mention of military power
population , which has suffered so appallingly
We are happy to talk about Afghanistan and spend a lot of time discussing the terror there and what the Taliban are doing , and rightly so
Here is another people , however , who have suffered and are still suffering the most appalling conditions
seems to be very difficult to bring about
Mr President , as this debate has shown , there are incredibly good reasons for continuing our commitment to the Democratic Republic of Congo
The EU is already highly committed to achieving long-term stability , security and development in the country
Commissioner De Gucht gave a long account of the EU's operations
influence
is improved , that human rights are safeguarded , and that vigorous action is taken against corruption in order to establish a society based on the principles of the rule of law
The appalling sexual violence that many Members have borne testimony to here and that we unfortunately hear about in far too many reports is naturally entirely unacceptable
The perpetrators must not be allowed to go free
They must be brought to justice
in action
a view to helping to combat precisely this kind of sexual violence
As a result , EUPOL DR Congo is to send two multidisciplinary teams to the provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu , with a mandate covering the entire country
These teams will provide various types of specialist expertise in areas such as the investigation of crimes and the control of sexual violence
Recruitment for these missions is currently under way
Of course , this is only a small contribution
In such a large country , it is modest
out by those in uniform
We are about to embark upon question time , but this is my final debate in this House as a representative of the Swedish Presidency
Parliament and with you , Mr President
I too would like to express , on behalf of all my fellow Members , our sincere thanks for your efficiency and your efforts which gave us all so much pleasure
Member of the Commission
- Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank all the Members who have contributed to this debate
I am not going to revert back to my initial statement
Let me just focus on three things
First , the European Commission is doing a lot with respect to humanitarian aid and programmes for re-establishing the rule of law
We are speaking about tens of millions and even more than EUR 100 million initially
But the problem is , of course , how effective is all this in the end , if you do not have a proper counterpart in the political arena
be the ultimate mistake to ask that they leave the DRC
This would be the worst thing one could imagine
Let me just read to you some sections of the mandate adopted by the UN Security Council at the beginning of last year
personnel , under imminent threat of physical violence , in particular , violence emanating from any of the parties engaged in the conflict'
Another very relevant paragraph is paragraph G regarding the coordinated operations
and jointly planned with these brigades in accordance with international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law with a view to' , etc
So the mandate is , in fact , very clear and what should be discussed are the rules of engagement
In fact , what MONUC should do is look at its own rules of engagement , because it is up to them to decide how they will proceed
Lastly , there is a lot of criticism also of international criminal justice
People are questioning whether this is compatible with politics
Can you have international criminal justice , on the one hand , and proper political management of a crisis , on the other
That is a very interesting question
In the Congo , you see one of the answers
We have allowed Bosco Ntaganda to take over the leadership of the CNDP from Laurent Nkunda , although there is a warrant against Bosco Ntaganda , and you see what happens
There is no such thing as a free lunch
You cannot choose between , on the one hand , management of a political crisis and , on the other hand , putting international criminal justice into practice
I think that , as the European Parliament and as the European Commission , the pre-eminence should go to the due application of international criminal justice
I have received six motions for resolutiontabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure

The vote will take place on Thursday , 17 December 2009
The report from the UN group of experts emphasises that a number of armed groups active in the country are supported by a well-organised network that is partly based
We have had Operation Artemis in Ituri province , the temporary EUFOR deployment in the period leading up to the 2006 elections , as well as EUSEC RD Congo for reform
It is important that the country's rich mineral deposits are brought under legitimate national control , both as a source of much-needed income for the state and in order to
Since there are many significant problems that still provide cause for deep concern , the Council has taken a tough stance as regards the serious crimes against international law and human
The Council recently condemned these acts in its conclusions and emphasised that the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo must ensure that all those responsible are brought to
We are very grateful in this respect for the constructive and persistent role played by the European Parliament , and I am looking forward to hearing your views in this
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , a year or so ago , the situation in Goma , a city besieged by the CNDP troops led by Laurent Nkunda , was the primary concern of
Promoting a political agreement , firstly between the DRC and Rwanda , and then between the Congolese Government , the CNDP and the other armed groups has made it possible , in the
The recent report by the United Nations group of independent experts and that by the Human Rights Watch organisation provide a damning account of the current situation that cannot
If this is to be done , however , it will require everyone's cooperation - the cooperation of the Congolese and Rwandan governments in the first instance , and of MONUC , the
There is no doubt that the political and diplomatic rapprochement between Rwanda and the DRC can be beneficial in terms of creating stability in the region and , if the will
The FDLR issue is at the heart of the problem , as are all the associated sets of problems that it entails and which complicate the situation: the illegal exploitation
of natural resources; the lack of protection for minorities; the impunity in a vast stateless area where the public authorities are not only incapable of controlling the territory but include
The agreement has simply resulted in the replacement of Laurent Nkunda by Bosco Ntaganda , who is more easily influenced and willing to reach any compromise whatsoever in exchange for
So far , the hasty integration of the CNDP into such an ineffective and totally chaotic army as the FARDC; the obtaining , by Bosco Ntaganda , of increased autonomous power resulting from
the implementation of a parallel chain of command within the FARDC , for which the irregular payment of the soldiers and the absence of any form of discipline or hierarchy provides
fertile ground; MONUC's insufficiently controlled and gauged support for the military operations against the FDLR; and the non-existent response to the demands of the Rwandophone minorities are factors that are
The situation has scarcely improved against this backdrop: the humanitarian crisis continues without any obvious signs of improvement , as do the human rights violations , the sickening trend of violence , indeed
It is clear that the actions aimed at preventing the FDLR from doing harm must continue , but not at any price , not without first having done everything it takes
A hasty withdrawal by MONUC would be disastrous , as it would create an even greater vacuum: the recent events in the Equator region , which are essentially one more symptom
Clearly , it is also important to stop the political and economic collusion from which the FDLR continue to benefit in the region and elsewhere in the world , including in our
The FDLR's campaign is not a political campaign , but a criminal act of which the Congolese population is the main victim , and this is how the campaign and all
At the same time , beyond the disarmament , demobilisation , repatriation , reintegration and resettlement (DDRRR) process , the Rwandan and Congolese authorities must be more perceptive with regard to individuals who are
In this regard , the agreements of 23 March must be applied in full , otherwise , sooner or later , we will see the frustrations of the local populations gain the upper
While it is true that , given the extent of its problems , the DRC cannot do everything at once , it clearly must demonstrate a solid political will if it is
In this connection I have also expressed my wish for the International Criminal Court and the Commission to cooperate more closely in practice with regard to the fight against
There are normal countries in Africa , where rich natural resources serve the good of the people , the public authorities care for the common good , children go to school , and
I , myself , was an observer during the elections , and we were all pleased because , after a gap of 40 years , democratic elections were taking place in that large and
Can I say , Commissioner , that I agree with you absolutely: we cannot pull out; we cannot create a vacuum , because a vacuum exists there already and that is a vacuum
It is reported that there are 1 460 000 internally displaced people , most of them facing violence , and let me give a voice to those who do not have a
Mr President , Mrs Malmstr√∂m , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , I have always kept a close eye on events taking place in the east of the Democratic Republic of
Despite the promising progress made thanks to the recent rapprochement between Rwanda and the DRC - a rapprochement without which there will be no solution in the east and
which must therefore be consolidated - despite the agreements of 23 March between Kinshasa and the Congolese rebel group , which the Commissioner spoke about , the situation in the east remains
Unfortunately , the main victims of the military pressure that the DRC is exerting at present and which is aimed at cutting these extremists off from their bases and their
This risk was foreseeable and , as the Commissioner said , MONUC's capabilities needed to be strengthened from the outset , as today it is still sorely lacking in resources suitable for coping
Even though we must demand a greater degree of coordination and a greater , more active presence on the ground , it would be dangerous to make judgments or comments about MONUC
The context of war cannot , of course , in any way justify such behaviour , and thus , I welcome the decision taken by the United Nations to stop providing logistical support
That is why I encourage the efforts made by the Commission , in close cooperation with certain EU Member States , to work on restoring a judicial system , including in the
The civilian populations and , in particular , women , are the main victims of the conflict strategies employed by the armed groups and even , as someone said , by certain units of the
Moreover , last month , a group of Congolese women came here to remind us of this - and rightly so - with the aim of enlisting our support against this
I agree with what was said just now: it is highly dangerous to discredit MONUC , to discredit it unnecessarily , to make it solely responsible for the situation in the
What must be reviewed are its rules of engagement , its operational directives , so that it cannot in any way be associated with or support a Congolese unit that has
The Congolese authorities , too , have a big responsibility in this fight against impunity concerning acts of sexual violence , crimes which , I might add , should be brought before the International Criminal
The UN mission MONUC did not prevent thousands of people being killed , tortured and raped and hundreds of thousands of people being expelled - atrocities in which the government
Or are we safeguarding a regime that , between 2003 and 2006 , for example , concluded 61 contracts with international mining firms , not a single one of which was judged by
My question is , why are the people who pull the strings of the largest group behind the murders in eastern Congo - the FDLR - reputed to be in
(DE) Mr President , the expulsion of millions of people , thousands of rapes and hundreds of murders must not be the sad legacy of the largest UN peace-keeping operation in the
Two war criminals were recently brought before the war crimes tribunal in The Hague and development projects and elections were able to take place - a partial success , at
UN soldiers must not stand there and do nothing when atrocities are being committed and , even more importantly , the army's logistics support must not be associated with support for
We must remember that the violence in the DRC , like so many conflicts of its type , is often driven by greed but also stems from and is fuelled by
With the post-Lisbon creation of our External Action Service , the European Union must take its place on the international stage as a more proactive facilitator of dialogue and a sponsor
More than 7 500 cases of rape and sexual violence have been recorded in the first nine months of this year alone , which is more than the figure for
Unfortunately , however , there are indications that the UN troops in the Congo bear a large share of the responsibility as they are allowing serious violations of human rights to
This is why I believe that the European Union must discuss urgently how the UN forces in the Congo are going to achieve properly the mission objectives that have
Measures are also required to put an end to money-laundering activities , arms trafficking and gold trafficking , which results in more than 37 tonnes of gold being illegally removed from the
(NL) Mr President , I have just listened to the speech by Mr M√∂lzer , who has now left , the gist of which was: it is so hopeless that we should just
On the other hand , I then think of the group of women who visited us here last month , to whom Mrs Durant also referred , and I wonder whether we
could look them in the eye and tell them that we are simply giving up , or that it is not one of our priorities , or that we mean to just
When I think of those women , of their despair and bitterness and the feeling that they have been left in the lurch , I do consider it eminently possible to
The women with whom we spoke said it goes far beyond attacks on individuals; it is not individual violence but rather an attack on the community , aimed at destroying
It is my view , therefore , that there is now a most urgent need for us not only to take action , put an end to impunity , pay on the nail
and provide the resources for the actions we have announced , but also to show that we are extending a hand to the people there , that we stand in solidarity with
(RO) At the present juncture , which also coincides with the moment when the United Nations is preparing to announce the extension of MONUC's mandate , I think we need to reflect
As is also borne out by the experience of Operation Kimia II conducted by the Congolese army with MONUC's support , military success is not sufficient when the cost in
I believe that the recent military operations conducted against the FDLR have had disastrous consequences , resulting , which we should be aware of , in large-scale human rights violations and exacerbating the
The European Parliament must strongly assert that acts of violence , particularly sexual violence , and human rights violations in general , as well as the abuses committed in Kivu , must stop
With the authority conferred on her by the Treaty of Lisbon and the support of the 27 Member States and of this Parliament , she could coordinate a whole programme

perpetrated against civilians and , more specifically , against women , children and the elderly , urgency - a word so often used by the European Union and by the entire international community with
The mandate given to the MONUC personnel on the ground will no doubt be extended , but it absolutely must be re-evaluated and strengthened , too , so that this rising tide
I welcome the recent determination shown by the Congolese authorities to put a stop to this impunity , but this zero tolerance policy must be ambitious - all perpetrators of
The opening , at the International Criminal Court , of the first trials of the alleged perpetrators of sexual crimes committed during an armed conflict must result in the Court being able
Lastly , all this , needless to say , goes hand in hand with the strengthening of state structures , the maintenance of law and order , the promotion of gender equality , and the protection
(FR) Mr President , the humanitarian situation in the east of the Republic of Congo - and , more specifically , in the eastern province and in the Kivu region - is disastrous ,
The security situation of the civilian populations deteriorated following , among other things , the joint military operations conducted by the Congolese army and the Ugandan and Rwandan troops against all
Since 1 January 2009 , more than 775 000 new cases of displaced persons have been recorded in the Kivu and 165 000 in the districts of the east of
(FR) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , all the speakers have rightly emphasised the terrible situation in which the Congolese people , and especially Congolese women , are living in the east
Today , I am going to talk to you about the real consequences that these barbaric acts have for Congo; I am going to talk about the physically and mentally wounded
women , who must be cared for; and I am going to talk about the murdered women , who will no longer be able to contribute to the economic development of Congo
I would also like to talk about the spread of AIDS , a trauma suffered by the entire Congolese population , which paints a negative picture of Congo to the international
Encouraging a lasting peace and promoting the economic development of Congo are only achievable if the Congolese Government and the UN are successful in their efforts to combat sexual violence
(FR) Mr President , Minister , Commissioner , I , in turn , would like to refer to the tragedy of the sexual violence suffered by women in the DRC and , more specifically , in the
However , faced with these figures and with the terrible , dreadful accounts we are hearing , do you not think that we in this House are entitled to have our doubts
Unfortunately , in the light of the constant acts of violence and the human rights violations in the east of the DRC , we are obliged once again to strongly condemn
That is why I join with my fellow Members in calling for all the competent authorities to intervene immediately in order to bring the perpetrators of these crimes before the
courts and in calling on the United Nations Security Council once again to urgently take any measures that have the capacity to actually prevent anyone else from committing further attacks
Similarly , I call on all the parties involved to step up the fight against impunity and to enforce the rule of law by combating , among other things , the rape of
(DE) Mr President , in November 2009 , there was an exchange of ambassadors between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo - a tiny ray of hope for this ravaged country
Let us be frank: if there is a UN mandate , then it should clearly be for the protection of those who are oppressed , tortured , violated and abused , in particular ,
In this regard , one thing must be quite clear: if a UN mandate is issued - and we Austrians are a bit restrictive in this area - then it
Mr President , I think it is unfortunate that in this Christmas season , we have spent the last two days discussing violence around the world , be it in Chechnya or in
And this is a great opportunity for the High Representative , Lady Ashton , to use the power and support of the European Union in a way that could not have
The long-term solution , though , will come not from economic improvement but from education , and we have to try and ensure free access to proper education in these countries , because that
Mr President , in 1960 , the Swedish Secretary-General of the United Nations , Dag Hammarskj√∂ld , asked the Irish troops to go as peacemakers into what was then the Belgian Congo , which became

I would like to stress that there are non-governmental organisations which can carry out work if they are provided with state support and with EU support , but that often
Taken together , the contributions of the Member States and the Commission make the EU one of the largest contributors of aid to the region , and therefore we can have an
If stability is to be maintained in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in the region , however , it is crucial that the standard of living of the Congolese population
The Congolese Government has a great responsibility to ensure that this happens and that President Kabila's zero tolerance policy does not just consist of fine words but actually results
As far as the Council is concerned , the mandate of the two ESDP missions was reviewed following the investigation mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo in early 2009 with

Role of the European Union in the Middle East (debate)
Middle East
It is my pleasure to welcome into our midst the High Representative , Mr Solana , and to ask him to address us
High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy
- Mr President , this is the first time that I have appeared before you this year , 2009
It is a great pleasure to be here and I hope that the good cooperation we have had in the past will continue this year
The war in Gaza ended a month ago , on 18 January , and I think you would agree with me that it feels like yesterday
The scale of the suffering and destruction was immense and it has left us all with a bitter taste in our mouths
The humanitarian situation today remains heart-breaking
We need to find urgent solutions to get aid in and to reduce the level of suffering of the people
At the same time , we need to do all we can to end the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians and between Israel and the Arab world
In fact , the parameters of the solution are well known , and have been known for some time
What matters now is the political will to implement it among Israelis and Palestinians , among Arabs and the wider international community
The European vocation for peace in the Middle East remains as strong as ever
Our commitment to the creation of a viable and independent Palestinian state , living side by side with Israel , is total
It is at the heart of our Middle East policy
All our actions have this strategic objective in mind
We will give our firm backing to all who want a peaceful solution to the many challenges across the Middle East region
This House - Parliament - knows just how difficult and how intractable the situation may seem
Too often , the region has been plagued by cycles of violence , rising extremism and economic hardship
At the same time , the conditions for Europeans and Americans to work together in the search for peace in the Middle East are probably better than ever
I have just returned from Washington where I had good discussions with everybody there in the Obama administration
I think I have the assurance from them that the strong commitment that has been expressed is a reality
We are willing and ready to work with them towards achieving success in this conflict
I think the appointment of Senator Mitchell as US envoy has given the people in the Middle East and his friends renewed hope
We know him
We have worked with him
I had the privilege of working with him in 2001 on the famous report and just recently , I have had the opportunity to work with him in the region
I hope very much that these changes will lead to a new approach , one that provides the parties with a greater say in how they manage their affairs
We know that solutions and proposals should be locally inspired
However , at the same time , deeper international engagement remains essential
This is why the Arab Peace Initiative is so crucial
This initiative is the collective expression of the Arab world on how they could help to end their conflict with Israel
It is their response to the issue that has held back their development and their integration into our global world
It remains , and should remain , on the table
We have just had important elections in Israel
Of course , it is for the Israeli people , their political leaders , to decide on the composition of their new government
From our side , we hope that the new prime minister and government will be solid interlocutors for peace talks
Needless to say , the same applies to the Palestinians
They , too , have to get their house in order , including through reconciliation
As everybody knows , we strongly encourage intra-Palestinian reconciliation behind President Abbas and all the efforts by Egypt and the Arab League in that direction
This will be a key to peace , stability and development
As I said , I know that this Parliament has been deeply preoccupied with the crisis in Gaza , and so have we all

Egypt's role in resolving the situation in Gaza , and indeed with the Palestinians themselves , remains crucial

Without this , it will be difficult - not to say impossible - to rebuild Gaza
We are looking forward to welcoming positive announcements on the ceasefire
delay
As you know , Egypt will also host an important conference on reconstruction on 2 March and we expect all the international community to make a commitment there
The European Union , too , played its role
We immediately expressed our willingness to contribute in concrete ways to a durable ceasefire
We also stated our readiness to re-dispatch our monitors to the Rafah crossing point , in accordance with the agreement that we signed in 2005
We are ready to operate at Rafah , or at any other crossing points where help is needed or requested
Several European countries also expressed their readiness to help the interdiction of illegal trafficking , in particular , arms smuggling , into Gaza
The activities of the European Parliament in response to the crisis have been significant and are part and parcel of the European Union's overall reaction to the crisis
efforts
But it is clear that no single country or organisation can tackle the conflicts in the Middle East alone
The very nature of the difficulties demands multilateral solutions
The Quartet will have a crucial role to play in the months ahead
The new US Administration , in cooperation with us , has confirmed its intention to make full use of the Quartet
The terrible events in Gaza should also force us to take a more strategic and long-term look at Gaza
The Gaza Strip constitutes an integral part of the Palestinian territory occupied in 1967 and , without any doubt , will be part of a Palestinian state
Gaza needs to become economically and politically viable
Gaza needs to become part of a political solution
The immediate priority remains to secure a durable and fully respected ceasefire and to allow for the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid
We need to see the opening of the crossings for humanitarian assistance , for commercial goods and for people , on a regular and predictable basis
have suspended ties with Israel; a withdrawal of the Arab Peace Initiative was threatened
Arab divisions , as you know , have deepened
Without Arab unity it will be very difficult to make progress in Gaza and in the wider Middle East peace process
Peace in the Middle East requires a united Arab world
The upcoming Arab League summit will be crucial to restore Arab unity , in particular , behind the Arab Peace Initiative
In the coming months , we will also have elections in Iran and in Lebanon
On 12 June , the Iranians will vote for a new President
We have repeatedly stated our deep respect for Iran and our desire to forge a completely different kind of relationship with this country
This is clearly in everyone's interests , but to achieve that , we need trust and that trust must be restored
Let me conclude by saying that 2009 will be critical for the Middle East
We are possibly at a threshold
We can choose to pursue the same policies in the same manner , knowing that they will lead to the same results - the results that we know today
On the other hand , we can try to work with energy , with determination , to adjust our policies , to adjust the way we set about achieving results
We have to work on both crisis management and conflict resolution - there is no doubt about that
However , the time has come to focus decisively on conflict resolution
It is the only way to end this endless sequence of death and destruction
(Applause)
Thank you very much , High Representative
the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly , to Gaza , Ramallah , Sderot und Jerusalem for two and a half days

In Gaza , preparations will be made for the United Nations visit , which will then be carried out
Member of the Commission
- Mr President , we are at a moment of transition in the Middle East
Soon , most probably , there will be a new Israeli Government
There is already a new US administration , currently defining its foreign policy priorities
And we may soon face transition in the occupied Palestinian territory
So changing dynamics can create opportunities for new engagement
However , there is no denying that the recent conflict resulted in enormous human suffering and destruction
It has left the Middle East peace process - we have to confess - in a particularly fragile state
This House knows that only too well , and I refer to the discussions and debates that we have already had here
This is clearly not where we wanted to be at the beginning of 2009
back on track
This human tragedy in Gaza has had a huge impact on the region
we need to do is to make clear to all Israeli leaders that the EU expects sustained commitment to the peace process and to the two-state solution
of the West Bank and Gaza and to get the peace process back on track
That is why the European Union is supporting the efforts of Egypt , Turkey and others to achieve this
With the new US administration , we need to agree a joint way forward
I spoke on the phone to Secretary Clinton to that end only last week
She agreed on the need for a lasting ceasefire and a return to the peace process , which is absolutely crucial
We also agreed that the Quartet should consult closely on these matters before the end of the month
I am glad that the American administration sees the Quartet as a very important institution for going forward on peace
Finally , we need to step up our own engagement with the Arab League countries
The consensus for peace is weakening , not only in Israel and within the occupied Palestinian territory , but also within the Arab League , where worrying divisions are appearing
To that end , as I just said , I have just returned from Syria and Lebanon , where I met President Assad in Syria , President Sleiman in Lebanon , and other key partners
The recent conflict has badly damaged negotiations not only on the Palestinian , but also on the Syrian , track
We therefore exchanged views on the peace process at length
serious framework for regional peace talks
I also stressed the milestone decision taken by Syria and Lebanon to establish diplomatic relations , and pushed for completion of all steps in this process
In both countries , we discussed practical ways in which the European Union could support the process of reform
In Lebanon , I reiterated our readiness in principle to deploy an EU election observation mission , and I have already decided that an exploratory mission should go there immediately
The European Union as a whole has been extremely active in recent weeks both on the political and practical fronts
On the political front , since I last reported to you in January , we have all pursued our intensive diplomatic activity
We have been at the forefront of calls for a ceasefire and have worked with Egypt and others to make a lasting ceasefire possible
The Council conclusions in January indicated that the EU is developing a 'work plan' for a lasting ceasefire
of the peace process
Much very delicate work is going on
Palestinian Authority , Jordan and Turkey on 25 January
In addition , Commissioner Louis Michel , who is responsible for humanitarian aid , visited Gaza on 24 and 25 January
We are in regular contact with Quartet colleagues
We had important meetings as a troika in Moscow
I had this telephone conversation with Clinton; Javier Solana was there in Washington , and we are agreed on the need to renew the peace process
We continue our road map monitoring work , and we also deploy state-building assistance , including in sensitive areas such as the rule of law and border management
The EU's action strategy for the Middle East also foresees EU support for specific final status issues , for instance , for Jerusalem , refugees and security arrangements
In practical terms , the EU has prioritised delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza
The Commission has already mobilised EUR 10 million practically overnight , and another EUR 32 million has now been committed for the coming period
In early March , the Egyptian Government is organising an international conference in Sharm el-Sheikh in support of the Palestinian economy for the reconstruction of Gaza
We , as the Commission , will be a co-sponsor of this event
Committee on Budgets at an early stage here in Parliament on 2 February
Thank you again for your support
The problem at the moment is not only funding , but access , particularly to Gaza
We have been very vocal , both in public and in private , about the unacceptable closure of the Gaza crossings
This House will wish to join me today in calling , once again , for the crossings to be fully opened
(Applause)
When access does improve - as I have no doubt it will - we may then have to review our financial forecast
At that point , I may need to come back to discuss this with you
I hope I will again be able to count on your support
swiftly as possible to one of the most troubled parts of the world
We will certainly continue to work very closely with this House
(Applause)
Mr President , Mr Vondra , Mr Solana , Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner , ladies and gentlemen , the situation in Gaza is getting a little worse each day
The population is suffering enormously
There is a shortage of everything
The embargo imposed on Gaza means each delivery of humanitarian aid has to get through an obstacle course
Even when it is delivered , the humanitarian aid is insufficient to meet the needs on the ground
The hospitals can no longer operate properly
The population can no longer be looked after
What is happening today in Gaza is a humanitarian catastrophe on a major scale
The European Union is already playing a major role in the region
The financial support it has given and continues to give to the Palestinians is considerable
It has done a lot upstream to prevent the humanitarian disaster we are witnessing today
Despite the obstacles , it continues to give humanitarian aid and assistance to the population of the Gaza Strip
Just today , the European Union has granted EUR 41 million in aid to the United Nations Agency for Palestine Refugees
This , then , is not the moment for us to start to keep our mouths shut
For me , the European message must be clear
We cannot tolerate humanitarian aid being taken hostage in this conflict
It is essential that this aid be able to move freely , without restriction , and that the checkpoints be opened
Moreover , we issue a warning to Hamas
repeated
and social rehabilitation of the Gaza Strip
This rehabilitation is essential for the region's stability
That is the objective of the donor conference that meets in Sharm el-Sheikh on 2 March
Let us , however , be clear
No reconstruction - yet another one - can take place before a lasting ceasefire has been called
A ceasefire and the cessation of military operations , on the part of Israel too , are absolute prerequisites for the reestablishment of peace in the region
from Gaza
All measures must also be taken to fight against the entry of arms and munitions through the tunnels linking Gaza with Egypt
Restoring dialogue between all sectors of Palestinian society and restarting the current negotiation process are essential
Egypt , which has a particular responsibility due to its location on the border with Gaza , must take an active part in this negotiation process
All our future diplomatic efforts must take this particular role of Egypt into consideration
We can only hope to find a solution to the conflict by keeping the diplomatic route open
and determination
Thank you , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the message from our debate can only be one thing: there is no violent solution in the Middle East
There is no military solution
There is no solution through terrorism
It may be the case that one party gains a short-term military advantage
It may be the case that a terrorist act causes a great deal of chaos
Yet experience shows that every act of violence generates more violence and pushes the cycle of violence further
asynchronicity
Yet there is also hope emanating from the United States
President Obama , Hillary Clinton and their team offer a consensus and dialogue-oriented model , something completely different from the previous administration which has now , thankfully , left office
So there is hope in Washington
What about Jerusalem , though
peace process in the Middle East
This asynchronicity poses a risk
What is going on in Lebanon
What influence will Hezbollah have in future
To what extent is it prepared to engage in constructive dialogue , before and after the election in Lebanon
What about the Western-oriented majority
Would that majority be able to react to an election victory by integrating Hezbollah
Is Hezbollah prepared to allow itself to be integrated
This depends , to a crucial degree , on who governs in Tehran
The issue of the election outcome in Iran is of central importance
This is also true for the attitude of Hamas
that is prepared to talk and this readiness to talk stretches from Tehran to Beirut and on to Rafah is a crucial issue for the stabilisation of the whole region
We are in favour of a unity government for the Palestinians
Without a unity government for the Palestinians , the peace process is unmanageable
It is therefore now up to Hamas to show that it is willing and able to join such a government
be forced onto the defensive by a government in Jerusalem that knows only the politics of continuing the settlements
to be absolutely forthright in making clear to our friends in Israel
In the Middle East , everything is interconnected
It is not possible to simply pick out individual elements and believe it possible to solve an individual problem by military means
That is why the basis for everything is the readiness to talk
The Arab League's plan , Saudi Arabia's peace plan , envisages an end to violence with simultaneous recognition of Israel's right to exist
This is a bold and ambitious plan , and it is one that needs to be discussed
It is progress in itself that there are people in the Arab League , in the Arab camp , who are prepared to have that debate
That is something that must be supported
build to be destroyed again for whatever military reasons
For this reason , our message can only be that dialogue is the precondition
High Representative Solana , you said that this is your first time before us this year
This is perhaps also your last visit before our elections in June
dialogue
Your work deserves more than respect
It deserves a great degree of admiration , above all , for your continuous advocacy of dialogue
For that , you have our sincere appreciation
(Applause)
Thank you very much , Mr Schulz
end of this parliamentary term
on behalf of the ALDE Group
- Mr President , it is with heavy hearts that we debate once again what our Union can do to ease the pain in the Middle East
Looking at the recent conflict in Gaza , all the old familiar phrases apply: blame on both sides; provocation by Hamas; disproportionate response by Israel
But in the face of the recurring violence , we have recycled those tired phrases so often that they have lost whatever impact they once had
We cannot go on like this
Of course , it is our moral duty to assist in the reconstruction of Gaza
Of course , it makes sense to seek safeguards from Israel
destroyed once again
Is it possible , is it credible , to imagine that Israel can assure us that this will not happen
In any event , reconstruction and humanitarian aid from the European Union will not prevent future conflict
We need a new and positive approach , jointly with the United States , if possible , but without them if not
Last month's violence and the outcome of this month's election have changed the terms of the debate
resistant to seeing a separate Palestinian state
Meanwhile , the gulf between the West Bank and Gaza grows ever wider , with the threat of a permanent division
agenda , but we can afford to wait no longer
With the situation in flux and neither Hamas nor the Israelis talking to one another , we must set achievable terms on which we can talk to both
Isolation has led only to despair
The time has come for diplomacy , delicate but determined
In which forum
In the Quartet , Mr Solana
watch
Its envoy , Tony Blair , has never even been to Gaza
If he went there , he could visit the site of the industrial area , which is one of his pet projects , designed to generate jobs , but levelled last month
(Applause)
The Quartet has to open its mind to a new approach and , if our partners within it cannot take that step , then we should explore ways in which it might
Lastly , we can only prepare for the future if we acknowledge honestly what has happened in the past
There should be a free and fair international investigation into alleged war crimes in the Gaza conflict
The UNRWA and our own parliamentary committee have both reported alarming evidence of war crimes , and the allegations are serious indeed
If Israel is wrongly accused , its name should be cleared , but if it has committed those crimes , it must face up to its responsibilities
Our aim must be to forge an agreement for a peaceful and prosperous future on both sides of the divide , where enemies can once again become partners
However , the failure of our approach to date is written in spilled blood on the ground
Mr Solana , we must pioneer a new path to peace , and the European Union , if necessary , must take the lead
(Applause)
on behalf of the UEN Group
- (GA) Mr President , High Representative and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner , I warmly welcome today's settlement to provide humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip
This is a step in the right direction for the European Parliament
The current humanitarian situation in Gaza is bad and the European Union has a responsibility to help
and the counter-reactions to different events
But three things jump out at us immediately when we speak about the Middle East
Firstly , it is not a negotiation of equals
There is strength on one side , weakness and division on the other side
Secondly , it is not an equal participation of outside influences and outside media coverage
One side gets more positive protection from international media and countries; the other side suffers under the derogatory terms of 'terrorism' or 'reactionary'
women , children , innocent civilians , people who have no truck with political groups , political organisations or with paramilitary groups or terrorist organisations
used - 'targeted intelligent bombing'
There is no such thing as an 'intelligent' or 'safe' bomb
When it lands , it blows up - it kills people
the Israeli forces have killed thousands and injured thousands of people within Gaza and within the Occupied Territories
day , the bombs came closer; and when they had to phone them a second time , the bombs landed on the fuel dump within the UN compound
but it is an act of attack on the institutions of peace , humanity and freedom
At times of war , there are rules of engagement , there are certain things which cannot be done
Of course , we must get aid and assistance to the Palestinian people for the rebuilding of their areas
as well
security and justice within the Middle East
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group
is humanitarian action , which is desperately needed
This is a real humanitarian crisis , and how are we going to address that urgently
Ninety per cent of people in Gaza are dependent on UN aid
This is not linked to any negotiations
We have to ensure that that aid gets through , and the key to that is the lifting of the siege and the opening of the crossing points
How can a densely populated area of 1
are being allowed in: food , some medicines and mattresses
You cannot rebuild homes and offices without cement and glass , which are banned
You cannot teach children in schools that have no paper because it is banned
You cannot feed people when there is not enough food being allowed in
It is not that the aid is not there , but it is not being allowed through
We have to put pressure on the Israeli Government to end the blockade and open the crossings
Any assessment of the damage caused in Gaza must draw attention to the deliberate targeting to destroy the infrastructure and the economy
We saw schools , factories , homes and a hospital deliberately attacked
relations when conditions on human rights are currently being breached under the current agreements
Mr Solana talked about how pursuing the same policies can bring us back to the same place
Well , I agree
may include members who reject a two-state solution , who do not support a Palestinian state
in the next few weeks , and we must give out clear signals of our intentions to the international community
past
(Applause)
not proud of Europe
lack of vision
the main European political leaders dare to raise a finger and say finally , 'Enough is enough'
operation in Gaza is just another stop along a trail blazing with fire , violence and hatred
A trail marked at times by victory , at other times by defeat , but which is leading us inevitably to ruin'
Or let them ask the same question as Shlomo Sand , the famous Israeli historian , whom I also quote: 'We sowed desolation
We have proved that we have no moral reserve
Have we strengthened the peace camp among Palestinians
' He continues: 'Israel has been pushing the Palestinians to despair
'
For 20 years , Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian Authority recognised the State of Israel with nothing to show in return
Israel refused the offer of the Arab League in 2002 , ladies and gentlemen
Everyone talks about the Arab League and about the Arab League's peace project
It has been in existence for seven years
What has Europe done to seize this opportunity
I therefore come back to Shlomo Sand: 'Israel refused the offer of the Arab League in 2002 of full recognition of Israel with the pre-1967 borders
' The Israeli historian concludes thus: 'Israel will make peace only if pressure is brought to bear on its policies'
This leads to a question , Mr Solano , as you said nothing on the subject of international law
a policy which pushes each day towards a divorce between Europe and the Arab-Muslim world
I would wish , as a European , not to have to place the hope for a change in policy towards the Near East solely on the occupant of the White House
I would still like to believe in an about-turn by Europe
(Applause)
(IND/DEM)
- Mr President , today we are debating a resolution about humanitarian aid
Before making my contribution , I would like to stress that I am not speaking on behalf of the IND/DEM Group as it has no position on this topic
Instead , I am speaking as an MEP on behalf of myself and of my people
The vast majority of the people of Gaza must rely on humanitarian aid for their very survival - food , water , shelter , clothes and , especially , medicine
This is a population that has been under siege for a very long time
All crossing points have been closed for 18 months and now , with the terrible recent aggression visited on the people of Gaza , they are even more desperate
Because the siege has still not been lifted and crossings are still closed , it is very difficult to get essentials to the people
I note in recital E of this resolution that we Europeans give ourselves a nice pat on the back for our humanitarian aid efforts
You , Commissioner , talked of the political efforts that you are making , but do we deserve this praise
Israel-EU trade is worth EUR 27 billion annually
If we really wanted action on Gaza , we would use the power that this trade gives us by imposing economic sanctions
humanitarian aid possibly being a salve to our conscience
far to dissolve or even just suspend the EU-Israel agreement
I have a great love of the Jewish people
In college , I took the opportunity to study several courses of their history and literature under a rabbi
However , friendship does not mean blindness but the willingness to be honest
Actually , judging by demonstrations that took place in the major cities of Israel , there are many Israeli citizens who publicly oppose their Government's action
an even more threatening regime is taking over in Israel
Rebuilding human infrastructure , however , cannot wait
We must get supplies in
I would especially point out that the particularly vicious weaponry used in January has left many people with missing limbs and terrible burns
I myself know what it is like to have a healthy child become disabled
We must get intervention - medical and educational - to all those thousands of people , especially children who , since the New Year , have become disabled for life
As we help them , we must record their stories , to begin the process of gathering evidence for targeted attacks and possible war crimes
role of mediator between Israel and Palestine
At the most , they will be called on to finance the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip , as they are doing today for Kosovo , Lebanon and Afghanistan
The US and Israel do the bombing while Europe finances reconstruction
That is how tasks are allocated amongst the allies
It should , however , be up to those who do the damage to pay
Egypt is at the centre of the peace talks that are discussing an extended ceasefire with Hamas
its task singularly complicated in this negotiation
In fact , Mr Netanyahu , who is presented as the future prime minister , has always been opposed to a truce with Hamas
A further difficulty is that the Palestinian Authority of Mahmoud Abbas has become , in the West Bank , a sort of international protectorate whose legitimacy has greatly diminished amongst the population
on the West Bank particularly tricky
the resources
Allow me to add a thought on France's return to NATO's integrated military structure , which will be debated within the framework of the Vatanen report
This return will result in France taking on heavy obligations
In fact , we are rejoining NATO even though the Cold War has been over since 1990
Mr Sarkozy seems to have forgotten the fall of the Berlin Wall and Russia's return to the ranks of free nations
level
Moreover , France's membership of the integrated structure will oblige it to reinforce its contingent in Afghanistan , even though it already has 3 300 men on the ground
Which funds will it use to finance this operation when its defence budget is about to fall below 2% of GDP and over 30 regiments are to be cut
Paradoxically , we are going to increase our financial participation to rejoin NATO and , at the same time , reduce our military presence in Africa
European defence , so beloved of President Sarkozy , will therefore be a pillar of the Atlantic Alliance
You only have to read the Treaty of Lisbon and its additional protocols to convince yourselves of this
allies
It is this logic of retraction that we reject in the name of national sovereignty and independence , which rest in particular on our independent nuclear deterrent
Other members have also overrun slightly , and we must accord the same treatment to everyone
High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy
- (ES) Mr President , I will not be able to answer all those who have spoken during this debate in the little time available to me
Allow me to express my most heartfelt thanks for what you said about me personally and what I do
the situation is becoming more difficult every day
I believe that there are five issues on which a consensus could be reached between all those who have spoken before me
First , humanitarian issues: there can be no doubt that the most pressing and important question is the humanitarian one
of Gaza
Therefore , we will do everything in our power to alleviate the great hardships of daily life in Gaza
The Commission will do so - without the slightest hesitation - as will the Member States of the Council; the entire international community will do so
Second , the opening of the border crossings between Gaza and Israel and between Gaza and Egypt is absolutely essential to this
Moreover , these must be opened quickly , without delay
as soon as possible
There are already European Union observers there , available , so that as soon as the frontier is opened at Rafah , we will be ready to deploy
Third , the issue - and it is a very important one - of Palestinian unity
Honourable Members , I believe that it is clear that there will be no solution at the moment without the beginnings of reconciliation between Palestinians
by President Abbas or by President Mubarak , to make progress towards reconciliation between Palestinians
Many speakers have mentioned the obligations that we may assume , depending on whether there is a new Palestinian consensus government
build an electoral process in 2009 , I believe that such a government is one that the European Union should support
Fourth , on the question of Israel: there are two important issues following the elections
to carry on with a peace process
and contributes towards carrying on a peace process , doing everything in its power to conclude that process as far as possible during 2009
Fifth , in our view , the settlements issue is absolutely fundamental
I believe that the most recent data concerning the state of the settlements in 2008 , published by the Government of Israel , ought to make all of us feel responsible
I would like to tell you that in 2001 , I worked with the then Senator Mitchell on the famous report that bears his name
I was one of the four people who worked on that programme
said today; for example , on the subject of the settlements
having credibility
Therefore , this issue must be taken seriously
We must talk seriously with our friends in Israel to ensure that the issue of the settlements is dealt with in a radically different way
Finally , Mr President , honourable Members: the Arab League
Unity among the Arab states is vital
It is essential that we cooperate with all the countries of the Arab League to ensure that the peace initiative signed by the Arab League remains in force
Crucially , this peace process must end with reconciliation between Palestinians and Israelis , but also between the Arabs and Israel
Therefore , we fully support those who are working to make the peace initiative a reality
We see deep divisions within the Arab League
within the great Arab family
Mr President , honourable Members , as I have said , 2009 will be an enormously important year
power to ensure that negotiation takes place between Israel and Gaza and between Egypt and Gaza
which we have unfortunately returned at the start of 2009
been weighing down on us for too long
Member of the Commission
- Mr President , I just wanted to say again that last year we clearly said that failure is not an option
We were all hopeful for the Annapolis process and we were hopeful for a peace process
Unfortunately , the military incursion into Gaza after the rockets launched from Gaza into Israel have changed the equation
Now we all know that there is a series of elements that is absolutely necessary so that we can come back to peace agreements
In any case , however , one thing is sure: a military solution is no solution
On this I agree with all of you
Therefore , whatever the cost , we will all have to work in order to bring about peace
Arab friends and colleagues
I can only hope that , when a new Israeli Government is in place , all those actors will want to come together for peace
Our rationale is clear , but whether the emotions will then bring us to the right path , we will have to see
Be assured that we will work for that
(Applause)
A motion for a resolution to wind up the debate has been tabled under Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure

It must stop settlement activities in the Occupied Territories and it must demolish the apartheid wall
Palestinians must be ended
A genuine process of negotiation must be begun
The EU must cancel the Association Agreement between the European Union and Israel while Israel does not comply with international law and humanitarian law
What should the 'role of the European Union in the Middle East' be (or not be)
What are the principles by which it should be guided
provided to them
It must condemn the brutal aggression , crimes , violations of the most basic human rights and state terrorism perpetrated by Israel against the Palestinian people , which nothing can justify
It must unequivocally denounce the fact that in Palestine , there are colonisers and colonised , aggressors and victims , oppressors and oppressed , and exploiters and exploited
It must suspend the Association Agreement and any strengthening of bilateral relations with Israel , such as those advocated by the External Relations Council on 8 and 9 December
Palestinian people
Jerusalem
In essence , it must stop being complicit in the impunity of Israeli colonialism
The recent elections in Israel and the new US administration offer the opportunity for a new beginning in the Middle East peace process
a dual-state solution , and help avoid military excesses and the serious humanitarian repercussions they entail
The EU's approach to the Middle East must be based on several strong principles
The first principle is close cooperation with the US without which we cannot achieve a long-term solution in the region
well as supporting moderate governance solutions from both sides which are capable of facilitating the peace process
for the discussions which will be conducted in Cairo in March at the time of the international donors' conference
in its relations with other states too
The situation affecting Gaza's population is tragic and must be resolved urgently
and of security and stability in the Middle East
to promote peace , security and stability in the area
With this in mind , the EU must step up its diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflicts and encourage dialogue and reconciliation in the region
At the same time , it must impose without hesitation tough sanctions against any anti-democratic stance or violation of human rights and freedoms
be the priority
The European Union should also do everything in its power to bring about an end to the dispute in which innocent citizens are losing their lives
Furthermore , efforts should concentrate on bringing assistance to people , on ensuring that they have the basic means to live
difficult conditions
The lack of drinking water constitutes no less a threat than the lack of food
and a return to normality
on close commercial cooperation with the region
turn , create a framework for closer cooperation between the Middle East and the EU
The next item is the statements from the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and from the Commission on the role of the European Union in the
Let me use this occasion to highlight some of the most important international efforts , which focused on trying to end the violence and easing the plight of all civilian
We hope their efforts will soon lead to a durable and sustainable ceasefire , to the opening of the crossings for all goods and persons , and some sort of intra-Palestinian
The day before yesterday , there were good meetings , and let us hope that they will continue today and in the future so that a ceasefire may be called , without
As far as the United Nations is concerned , we can warmly commend UNRWA for its work and perseverance and underline that the European Union will continue to support all its
As you know , the diplomatic fall-out of the Gaza conflict in the wider region has been very significant: indirect talks between Syria and Israel have been suspended; Mauritania and Qatar
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to bring to your attention the fact that , this coming Sunday , I will be leading a delegation , in my capacity as President of
Amongst other things , talks are to be held with President Peres and Prime Minister Olmert in Jerusalem and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority and Prime Minister Fayyad
But if there is , some day , to be peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians , the only way forward is to do all we can to get the talks
I returned only last night from a trip to Syria and Lebanon , and I will certainly also say something about that but , in particular , let me say that what
We also need to reinforce the message to the Palestinians that a strong Palestinian Authority with effective leadership over the entire occupied Palestinian territory is essential both for the reunification
I reiterated the very strong support of the European Union for the Arab peace initiative , and I urged partners to maintain their commitment to it , because it offers a
This document identifies six areas for action including humanitarian response , the prevention of smuggling to Gaza , the re-opening of the Gaza crossing points , reconstruction , intra-Palestinian reconciliation and the resumption
To give but a flavour of the pace of activity we have all been involved in: for instance , I was at a working dinner of the Paris Co-Chairs on
15 January , the Summit meetings in Sharm el-Sheikh and Jerusalem on 18 January , and EU ministerial meetings with Israel on 21 January and with a group composed of Egypt , the
I am delighted that I had the opportunity to discuss the pledge that the Commission intends to make with the Chairs of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the
Honourable Members , you can count on the commitment of the Commission - and also on my personal commitment - to do everything in our power to help bring peace as
Last month's incidents , when Hamas confiscated , and failed to return , the humanitarian aid distributed by the United Nations Agency in the region are scandalous , intolerable and must not be
All the players involved must anticipate the reconstruction phase and actively prepare it by assessing the damage on the ground and by preparing a plan for the financial , economic
It also begins , with reference to Hamas - and I say this with the utmost firmness - with putting a definitive end to the firing of rockets into Israel
I call on all the parties involved , including the Quartet , the Arab League and the diplomats of the Member States , to continue to engage in the negotiations with firmness
What is crucial , therefore , is dialogue , and that is something that is extremely difficult in the Middle East , especially in a time of uncertainty and , to some extent , of
What Benjamin Netanyahu had to say during the election campaign certainly did pose a threat to the peace process , while Avigor Liebermann is also certainly a threat to the
The question of whether we have a radical president who denies Israel's right to exist - as the current incumbent does - or whether there is to be a government
The basic precondition for this , however , is to be talking with Hamas , that those amongst the Palestinian people who want to talk with Hamas be supported and that they not
As a side point , if it is true that 163 hectares have now been re-released for settlement , this is a destabilising element and this is something that we need
Bombers are not the way to support this , and I might add that the way to support the work of the European Union is likewise not for what we
As dialogue is very much a sine qua non for success , I would like to say to you , on behalf of my group , that you represent the personification of
We do , of course , hope - and this is something we can all agree on - that Mr Solana will come before us a few more times before the
It is bad enough to see the airport , schools and sewerage systems blown up; it is worse to rebuild them with European money knowing that they will likely be
Hamas is stronger politically , it is intact militarily , it is holding out against recognising Israel , and the expected coalition in Israel will be more hard-line than ever and broadly
The Council and the Commission have not really said what their response will be to this turn of events , and the Czech Presidency appears to want the matter off the
Well , perhaps , but let us first acknowledge that the policy failures , the dashed hopes and the creeping extremism of the past seven years have taken place under the Quartet's
Many words have been spoken with regard to the need for peace , dialogue , understanding , temperance - if one would wish to use that word - with regard to the reactions
Thirdly , and most importantly of all , despite all the political disagreements , geographical disagreements and historical disputes , it is the same people who continue to suffer day after day after day:
These are the poor innocents caught in the middle of the rocket fire , of the bombing and the so-called - and I laugh when I hear these words being
We have ample evidence to show that not only the Hamas rockets going into Israel killed innocent people but that , a hundred times more , the bombs and the bullets from
Indeed , we have evidence from an Irishman , John King , who works for UNRWA in Gaza , to show that , when they informed the Israeli authorities that their bombs were landing
close to a UN compound in Gaza that was storing fuel and food and was also acting as a refuge to children whose school had been bombed earlier in the
Perhaps it is negligence , misinformation or deliberate targeting , but one way or the other it is an act - maybe not quite a war crime in some people's minds -
Of course we must ensure and insist that talks take place and that peace can be allowed to flourish , but that requires us to take brave moves within Europe
Like Martin Schulz , I congratulate Javier Solana on walking that long lonely path of speaking to people that nobody else would speak to , of opening the doors of dialogue ,
because ultimately only through dialogue between enemies can you make peace , and only through peace can you build the foundations of a solid two-state solution that will guarantee peace , equity ,
- Mr President , I was a member of the European Parliament delegation that travelled to Gaza last week to see the devastation , and the focus of Parliament's resolution today
5 million people that has been bombed for 22 days and in which over 1 000 people were killed even begin to recover when only 15 categories of humanitarian items
Once again , we have witnessed the destruction by Israel of projects funded by the European Union and , rather than take action on this , we are talking about upgrading trade
In 2006 , the European Union refused to recognise the Palestinian Unity Government , which included members of Hamas , and yet we are ready to recognise a new Israeli Government , which
What is crucial now is that the EU must be prepared to work with and recognise an interim Palestinian national government of consensus that should emerge from the Cairo talks
We have to support the reconciliation process in Palestine as part of achieving a long-term solution , and that means ensuring that we do not repeat the mistakes of the
Mr President , Mr Solano , Commissioner , as I listened nearly a month ago to the children of Gaza speak , amongst the ruins of their house , of how they had trembled as
the bombs fell , or to their parents describe the hell of those 22 days and nights that will forever mark their lives and the memory of future generations , I was
I thought of some of the leaders of our Member States , of all those who will answer to history for their lack of political courage , the missed opportunities , for their
I asked myself this question: to what extremes must the Israeli leaders push their inhumanity towards the Palestinians and their scorn for law and the most fundamental values before
Those who call themselves friends of Israel to justify the impunity and unlimited accommodation shown towards its current ruling class should reflect on these words from the great Israeli writer
David Grossman , whom I wish to quote: 'Amidst the wave of nationalist hyperbole now sweeping the nation , it would not hurt to recall that in the final analysis , this last
What pressure is the Union prepared to exert on Israel over Gaza and the West Bank , including Jerusalem , to remind its current and future leaders that membership of the
international community in general , and the privileged partnership with the European Union in particular , come at a price , that they have no place for military occupation , nor war crimes , nor
Our refusal to do this , even at the height of the bombing in January , indicated that we prefer the status quo of business as usual , with our contribution of
Not only are we unwilling to risk upsetting a good business market for the sake of bringing injustice in Gaza to an end , but we are also unwilling so
To return to the urgency of the humanitarian aid: rebuilding physical infrastructure is important , but it is understandable that agencies may be hesitant to rebuild when it looks as though
(FR) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is certainly not Europe , still less its High Representative for Foreign Policy , Javier Solana , the former Secretary-General of NATO , who can play the
However , the challenge is formidable as the new Israeli Government , under pressure from the third man , Mr Liebermann , the far-right leader who is democratically accepted over there , risks seeing
The final factor we have to take into account is that the expansion of the Israeli colonies , which has not stopped since 1967 , makes the creation of a Palestinian State
Today , the ball is in the Israeli court , but will the hawks in each camp accept this truce of God that the two sides demand without providing themselves with
Is there a need to reinforce the bloc line of thinking at a time when we see multipolarity and the rising power of emerging countries , including on the military
Whether it be in terms of foreign policy or common security , the European road is a dead end that can only lead to an alignment with the US and its
I would just like to tell you that you can be sure that I will continue to work just as determinedly - even more so if possible - because
The violence of recent days and weeks has thrown into sharp relief some enormous gaps in what is needed to alleviate the population's suffering , in particular , amongst the people
From our point of view , all aid will be supplied wherever it is needed and , as far as Rafah is concerned in particular , we will be ready for deployment
Therefore , as stated in the Resolution of the most recent General Affairs Council , the European Union supports , and will continue to support , the efforts that are being made , whether
It seems to me , honourable Members - and this is my personal opinion - that if there is a Palestinian consensus government , a government whose goal is the Two
States , a government whose goal is to build these Two States through peaceful means , a government that has a programme of reconstruction in Gaza , and a government that attempts to
Firstly , that the government that has emerged from the elections , or that will emerge from the majority produced by the elections , is obliged , as far as we can see ,
For this reason , whatever government does emerge from the elections , we will continue working and doing everything we can to ensure that it becomes established , and that it works
I would like you , honourable Members , to be so good as to re-read that report , published in 2001 , in which things were said that , unfortunately , still have to be
If we in the European Union are incapable of trying to change the way in which the settlements are being established , there is little chance of any peace initiative
We will have to do everything that we can diplomatically to prevent a deepening of these differences and instead encourage the rebuilding of a process of harmony and cooperation
We will have to continue to manage the crisis , bring humanitarian aid , do everything in our power to ensure that there is a ceasefire , and do everything in our
However , honourable Members , if we do not change our mentality from a position of crisis-management to one deeply rooted in conflict-resolution , we will be in the same situation to
Mr President , I hope that , in the end , if we all work together , 2009 will be a year in which we can actually resolve this enormous conflict which has unfortunately

A proactive , long-term strategy from Europe and from the new US Government must include the right of Palestinians to a sustainable state - based on the borders that were there
The security of Israel and a free state of Palestine must be achieved , but the situation where Israel is using security as an excuse to destroy the lives of innocent
It must demand an end to the aggression and to the inhumane blockade of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and it must ensure that urgent humanitarian aid is
It must demand compliance by Israel with international law and the UN resolutions , and an end to the occupation , settlements , security fence , assassinations , detentions and innumerable humiliations inflicted on the
It must demand and fight for respect for the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to an independent and sovereign state , with the 1967 borders and a capital in East
I believe that the EU must convey a clear message of support to the new cabinet in Tel Aviv while , at the same time , clearly expressing what is expected
of its Israeli partners in terms of pursuing measures which will facilitate a lasting peace , which includes shutting down the settlements on the West Bank and offering strong support for
The second is that our approach must be aimed at avoiding , as far as possible , violence by both sides , condemning Palestinian extremism and excessive measures adopted by Israel , as
I wish to express my support for the European Parliament resolution voted on today , which confirms the EU's commitment to the process of reconstruction in Gaza and provides the basis
Democracy , peace and respect for human rights are fundamental values for the European Union which has the role and obligation to defend and promote them , both inside the EU and
The flagrant violation of human rights and freedoms in this region is a cause for concern for the European Union , from the perspective of both its relations with Israel

In order to achieve an EU-Middle East agreement , the attempt to restore stability , and assistance in realising the peace programme in the Gaza Strip , should , for the present , continue to

We are far too dependent on third countries for our feed and need to begin cultivating more ourselves
the process of approving new types of GMO grain for import is taking far too long , and feedstuff from soya urgently requires to be speeded up
If this does not happen , livestock producers across the European Union will have to cope with rising prices , volatility and uncertainty for a long time to come
May I also briefly mention how the situation is affecting the pig and poultry industry
Farmers in this sector are feeling the crisis quite acutely , as their costs are rising and the price of pigmeat is falling
I would like to ask the Commission to monitor the situation closely and utilise all the tools that it has at its disposal to rectify matters
Beef producers , sheep producers , pig producers , poultry producers are all in a situation where they are making a loss
Need I go on telling the House that all these areas are actually suffering
this food from abroad , with all the problems this entails
So we have got to have security of our own food supply within Europe
If we do not do that , it will be at our own peril

- (ES) Madam President , Commissioner , the profitability of livestock production is directly linked to feed costs
political year
The meat sector that is having the most difficult time is currently the pork sector
therefore crucially important in terms of profitability for producers
sector
Action must therefore be taken against speculation , along with a policy encouraging the holding of sufficient strategic stock to avoid speculation
We welcome the fact that grain intervention stocks are being put on the market
We just have to hope that their final destination will be the EU market , otherwise they will not help the livestock sector
A tax on exporting European cereal , as in the case of wheat in 1994 , would be a possible solution
Another problem is the pressure of mass distribution with falling prices , which means that increases in production costs cannot be regained from the sale price
Producers' organisations need to be promoted that are capable of positioning themselves in the market , concentrating supply
efficient and flexible market management mechanisms to combat and act against the problems
This means combating speculation and using specific measures to promote the competitiveness of the sector in the market and increase its weight in the value chain
I would also like to take this opportunity to ask for the activation of the market measures applicable to pork , export refunds and private storage
The Commission does not think that the situation in the sector justifies this
However , in recent months , there has been a continuous decline in prices , and the prices received by breeders are below the average for the last five years
I believe it is justifiable for the Commission to trigger the existing market management measures , as some Member States have requested in the Council
market , and then I will also refer to the mechanisms at our disposal for the livestock sector
The Commission is following the situation in the cereals markets and its repercussions for farmers very closely
Cereal prices increased sharply over the summer due to supply shortages , particularly in the Black Sea countries
Thus , we have seen the price of barley and oats rise to as much as EUR 200 per tonne
At present , even though prices are very volatile , they are still well below the record prices of 2008
The strength of the euro against the dollar , which makes EU exports less competitive right now , is also a disruptive factor in the European market
Globally , despite the shortage recorded in Russia and Ukraine , the level of cereals harvested is normal , and stocks have been replenished thanks to the last two record harvests
almost 60 million tonnes more than we are expected to use
The grain intervention stocks , which mainly consist of barley , currently stand at 5
6 million tonnes
A 2
market shortly
The decision has , in fact , already been taken , and the cereals will be placed on the market at the end of this month
The pressure on the market has eased somewhat since the Commission announced this measure , which I recently announced to the Council
the European market with cereals , since the high price of cereals on the European market is not due to a lack of market supply
The Commission is paying very close attention to market developments in the livestock sector , and more particularly in the pigmeat and poultry production sectors
The margins in this sector are , in fact , highly dependent on the costs of foodstuffs
Prices in the poultry sector are above the long-term average and appear to be at least partially offsetting the increased food costs
The price of slaughter pig is following the seasonal downwards trend
It is very slightly below last year's level
Production is currently well absorbed by the internal market and exports
Between June and August 2010 , pigmeat exports were up by 10% and poultry exports by 21% compared with the same period last year
Consequently , despite these price issues , pigmeat and poultry producers have still been able to export for some time
The Commission will obviously continue to monitor developments in the market and will use the means at its disposal to intervene in the market if this proves necessary and useful
Indeed , two measures are currently available for the livestock sector: export refunds and private storage
With regard to export refunds , this measure would not be effective at present because the world price is rather high; therefore , an export subsidy cannot be justified
The relationship between the dollar and the euro means that export problems and a lack of competitiveness are possible , but this problem is not exclusive to the agricultural sector
discuss private storage measures
For the moment , there are no meat surpluses in the internal market , and that is why private storage measures cannot be justified at present
However , I am willing to consider the possibility of resorting to these measures depending on how the markets evolve
On the issue of volatility , this will be addressed in the common agricultural policy reform for 2013
It is envisaged that this reform will include proposals for as yet non-existent mechanisms to address the issue of income volatility
the way in which added value is shared out
Those are the answers I am able to give at this stage
Madam President , Mr Ciolo≈ü , ladies and gentlemen , today's motion for a resolution will help to set the European livestock sector on the right course
I would like to thank Mrs Garc√≠a for this initiative
The objective of the motion is not to cut Europe off from the rest of the world or to override the rules of the market
future
provide one certificate of competence after another , while maintaining high animal welfare and environmental standards
Rules of this kind apparently do not apply to imported agricultural products
and environmental protection standards in future
Mr Ciolo≈ü , Parliament is ready to give you its full support
These standards must be applied to imports and this is why my group welcomes and supports this motion
European livestock sector has plunged
volatility on the agricultural sector as a whole
Many actions can still be deployed to send out a strong signal to European livestock breeders
for the avian and fisheries sectors
justified for ruminants
of offering these animals a greater possibility of higher-energy diets
on behalf of the ALDE Group
- Madam President , the livestock sector is an important traditional farming industry which represents the livelihood of thousands of producers across the EU
This sector is central to the socio-economic contribution made by agriculture to the rural areas of the European Union
It is a key agri-industry in Europe and even more so in Ireland , as Ireland is the fourth largest exporter of beef in the world
In particular , the high cereal prices exacerbate the problems for profitability amongst winter beef finishers , who have a higher dependency on cereal-based feed imports
market price volatility
Action is also needed to close the gap between prices paid by consumers and prices received by producers
Secondly , it is essential that the Commission steps up measures to support the livestock sector in less-favoured areas , in particular
The next CAP reform must focus on the special vulnerability of certain livestock sectors and the significant production costs that farmers undertake
Under the next CAP , the excessive bureaucratic burden on livestock farmers must be addressed and reduced
Lastly , European producers comply with the most stringent regulations in the world in terms of food safety and quality , the environment , and animal health and welfare
These high standards must not put them at a disadvantage in comparison to third country competitors
but support the sustainability and viability of the European livestock sector into the future
Madam President , Commissioner , just as in 2007 , world cereal prices are soaring , and farmers are seeing a sharp rise in their production costs as they did two years ago
Cattle feed accounts for 60-80% of their costs , and their revenues are plummeting: they survive on an average of EUR 700 per month
Must we wait for successive crises to destroy Europe's small-scale agriculture before we act
Consumers pay EUR 17 per kilo of rib steak in the supermarkets , while producers receive EUR 3 per kilo - is that right
On 7 September , Parliament gave its verdict by voting for the report on fair revenues for farmers
It urged the Commission to act swiftly and prohibit selling below purchase price
processing and distribution sectors
Farmers expect even more: they want to see common market organisations established or strengthened , since they are the only means of stabilising costs and providing long-term economic visibility
Next week , Commissioner Ciolo≈ü will present his proposal to reform the common agricultural policy; he will have to give some clear answers to farmers
Europe's credibility is at stake
Europe needs every single one of its farmers
Madam President , I very much welcome the fact that we are dealing with the situation in the livestock sector , because it is a serious one
I would like to draw attention to the problem which is the subject of paragraph 15 of the motion , namely , the problem of animal welfare
Standards of animal welfare should be obligatory and should be improved
I am emphatically in favour of ensuring that livestock have the best living conditions possible
Europe from markets and third countries where no standards of animal welfare are maintained at all
This has to change
their meat and livestock products to the European market
Madam President , Commissioner , lessons really must be learnt from the policies currently in force
per month - EUR 700 and EUR 800 per month
- while the retail price of meat has risen by 40%
destroy entire regions
Have the courage , instead , to protect European agriculture and stop letting the World Trade Organisation decide the fate of our farms
Implement new tools for regulating production
Say 'no' to lethal competition within the European Union itself and introduce fair , stable basic prices , by promoting farming based on grazing
Take action to stop this appalling speculation on cereals
Commissioner , this is urgent; the situation is starting to take a tragic turn in our rural areas
A laissez-faire policy discredits the European project itself
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , cereal price volatility is having severe repercussions on all livestock sectors but also on consumers
Cereal exporting is blocked due to the effect of the heat , fires , drought and floods - as is happening now in Italy
To aggravate the situation , Canada has reduced production following heavy rainfall this summer
Prices have been influenced not only by climate change but also by speculation on international markets
Cereal producers who are awaiting a price increase wait before selling their produce and put it in store , with the result that these agricultural products deteriorate
Speculation and severe climate change have led to a great increase in the prices of cereals used as animal feed and a knock-on increase in meat prices
I believe it is essential for the Commission to ensure timely , targeted action to deal with the volatility in agricultural-product prices through innovative market interventions under the new CAP
The Commission must prevent speculative practices in agriculture to preserve the businesses of farmers and stock breeders and guarantee consumers genuine quality products at fair prices
Madam President , I would urge the House to support this extremely important motion before us this morning
many livestock farmers find themselves in is simply unsustainable
be more reliant on third country imports
they provide to agriculture
In Northern Ireland , the beef price is well below the cost of production
activity in rural areas and a reduction in food production across the EU
It is high time we recognised the importance of food security and the value of the work carried out by farmers across Europe
Finally , the current trade talks with the Mercosur bloc are having a destabilising effect within the industry
Coupled with difficult market conditionings and increasing costs , the livestock sector has been burdened with the further uncertainty created by reopening of the talks
for European farmers and the quality of food being provided to the citizens of Europe
farmers
It is a known fact that in farming , cereal prices affect approximately 80% of the price of animal feed
This , in turn , affects roughly 70% of production costs
It is impossible to increase proportionally the sale price of meat to the producer
Livestock farmers have no contact with the end consumer , but deal with the processors who always have the option to import
At the same time , processors pass on their large profit margin which they have been accustomed to hitherto in the sale price
Unfortunately , this period is coinciding with a general economic crisis and the decline in the population's purchasing power is also affecting livestock production
There is another factor to consider
will help prolong the crisis for more years in the future
In order to maintain domestic prices at a reasonable level and ensure animals receive the feed they require , intervention stocks need to be released
I am therefore pleased by the announcement made by Commissioner Ciolo≈ü today
imports
Last but not least , today's debate is closely linked to the future of the common agricultural policy
direct support measures
(PT) We are all aware of the enormous difficulties that the European livestock sector is undergoing , the pig-farming sector in particular
is high cereal costs
The European Parliament cannot remain indifferent to this situation
It is therefore necessary to act immediately using the available mechanisms , and on this issue , I welcome the Commission's decision to release 2
8 million tonnes of cereals , a measure that is positive but manifestly insufficient
the problem
Long-term solutions will need to be found in the context of the debate that we are about to begin on the new common agricultural policy
fact , and needed very quickly , Commissioner
(DE) Madam President , Mr Ciolo≈ü , there is no question that the crisis must be resolved
However , this motion proposes solutions which we cannot support
Making the import of GM soya easier will not help to resolve the crisis in the livestock sector
On the contrary , we must begin to redevelop our own source of plant protein in Europe
Around 75% of our plant protein is imported
This is not acceptable and we need to introduce urgent changes
soya imports
That is not a solution
We also need to discuss what type of livestock farming we want in Europe
Once again , the small farms have been hit hardest by the crisis
On the other hand , industrial-scale livestock farming is developing in Europe which is not livestock friendly and which is not fair in agricultural terms
We ultimately need to do something in this area as well
My final point is that I am very surprised that EUR 450 million from the agriculture budget is being transferred to the ITER nuclear fusion project
I would like Mr Ciolo≈ü to explain what we should think about this
(GA) Madam President , the result of the substantial increase in the costs relating to animal feed is instability within the European agricultural industry
The fluctuation of prices has an adverse effect on an already vulnerable livestock industry
The increase in costs of compound feed is pushing up production costs for the livestock sector , and more flexibility is needed in respect of assistance to this sector
It is time for the Commission to propose measures for reducing price instability and stabilising the price of feed
I am glad to hear from the Commissioner that he is considering a new instrument to deal with price volatility post-2013
Appropriate measures and instruments are needed now too
Madam President , I support Mr De Castro's remarks about meat and bone meal; deregulation in this area is highly necessary
The British livestock sector is struggling with high feed costs at present , and this is not helped by impediments which are placed in our way by the Commission
for imports of sheepmeat from third countries
The impending ban on battery cages is producing huge distortions in our egg market , as caged eggs from non-compliant Member States can undercut our more expensively produced colony eggs
with your rules which , of course , is putting more eggs on the market
Overhanging the entire British livestock sector like a lead balloon is the spectre of the EU opening bilateral trade talks with Mercosur
The British livestock farmer will be the sacrificial lamb in this deal and we are not happy about it
(HU) There are many reasons for the crisis in the livestock sector
Those who say that one reason is the unfair competition caused by imports and mention the dangers of the Mercosur negotiations are right
I wish to raise the issue of the surge in grain prices
It was foreseeable that grain prices would rise , and I have said this several times here in the European Parliament too
The European Commission has done nothing to prevent this
One reason for this problem is the reduction in intervention , which was a serious mistake
We must wake up to the fact that global grain trade is concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer companies
Incidentally , the same thing is happening in many of the EU Member States
The European Union decided not to keep emergency stocks , a decision which will further increase speculation in the future
The fluctuation of grain prices causes losses not only to grain producers but also to livestock breeders and consumers
In addition to this , the costs are also borne by European taxpayers
Remember that the European Union sold the 2004/2005 intervention stocks at an enormous profit
Grain prices were low in the past period
If the European Union had intervened then , a huge profit could now be realised from the sale of grains , which would also help livestock breeders
of providing aid to countries afflicted by famine , such as Pakistan
(HU) Firstly , Commissioner Ciolo≈ü's efforts for the European Union to establish , at last , an appropriate protective mechanism against the global volatility of food prices deserve full support
Secondly , the high grain and animal feed prices point to the emergence of a shortage of protein in the European Union , on which Mr H√§usling will draft a report
factor contributing to the current livestock crisis
Fourthly , livestock keepers are at a disadvantage in the supply chain compared to processors and traders
Fifthly , livestock keepers are forced to make disproportionately large environmental protection investments
This is particularly serious in the new Member States
This , too , should be addressed and remedied
situation of livestock farming in mountain areas
In many regions of the European Union , there are agricultural alternatives to livestock farming , but this is generally not the case in mountain regions
If there were to be no grazing stock in the mountains , then many of the agricultural areas there would simply be useless and would be abandoned
This would not only restrict the business opportunities in mountain regions , but would also change the landscape and eventually reduce biodiversity
The dairy sector plays a special role in this respect , because it creates jobs and generates income in mountain regions and in other areas
This is why I believe that we must focus specifically on three issues in the reform of agricultural policy
We need a common agricultural policy (CAP) which takes into account livestock farming in mountain regions and provides subsidies to livestock farmers there
Secondly , we need a flexible second pillar of the CAP which makes it possible to provide special support for livestock farms in mountain areas
on the market for these products from the livestock sector in mountain areas
(PT) We are probably on the way to another commodities bubble
Prices on the international market have increased by more than 16% on average since June
Never has there been so much negotiating on the futures market , nor has there been so much money involved
with the real economy
The figures for the largest cereals exchange in the world , the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , are impressive , and transaction records are being broken in purchases of soya , maize and wheat
The practical result is the transfer of these increases to real market prices , even in a year when cereals are widely available
increases in what they sell because of the crisis and are unlikely to be able to absorb them
It is , therefore , time to take action and protect our food from financial speculation
I would like to know , then , what the Commission intends to do about this
(FR) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , what a funny old world the agricultural world is
A year ago , in this Chamber , we were all bemoaning the general production situation
Today , one production sector , the cereal sector , is doing better than the others - and I think we should , all the same , welcome that
However , its success is unfortunately having very serious repercussions for another sector , the livestock sector
The real issue today is the agricultural industry's inability to pass on the costs it has to incur to consumers
in particular , in their dealings with the large-scale distribution sector
However , the chain , the functioning of the markets is more pernicious
How can we explain the fact that , for years , decades , we said that South American countries were placing a strain on production and bringing prices down
increase in costs , but - and this must also be said - there has been no increase in producer prices
How can we fail to mention the cost differentials that exist between our countries
Admittedly , this is partly a question of national responsibilities
However , the dumping that goes on today between our various countries helps destabilise markets , and I believe that Europe should tackle this issue
Yes , solutions must be found
European cereal producers are aware , I think , of the situation faced by their main customers - farmers
They are prepared to enter into a contractual agreement
Are you prepared , Commissioner , to support that agreement
with major shocks like the grain price hike we are seeing
are further calling for an adequate CAP budget post-2013
The costs of inputs and overbearing regulations are making EU farms uncompetitive and the viability of our farm sector is deteriorating
Our grassland system of quality and environmentally sustainable beef production is being undercut by third country imports
We must give our farmers a fair chance and , in my experience , that is all they want
The EU's lack of self-sufficiency in grain is becoming a serious issue , not just for the beef but also for the pig and poultry industries
This motion is a statement of the seriousness with which this House takes ongoing developments in our agricultural markets
We as a Parliament must intervene when we feel the situation is urgent and , to be quite frank , Commissioner , our beef , poultry and pig sectors immediately need positive intervention
I look forward to your response
(PL) Madam President , Commissioner , the situation this year is teaching us that an appropriate level of cereal reserves is essential to ensure food security and market stability
This security should be guaranteed by appropriate decisions at EU level
Another very important matter is the search for new sources of protein - this is a very good route towards the independence of European agriculture
We must , therefore , promote the cultivation of protein-rich crops
Let us remember , however , that it is our unconditional obligation to guarantee farmers permanent access to feed
of soya
Continuation of the policy of zero tolerance constitutes a threat to the entire food production chain
(EL) Madam President , there are currently two threats to global livestock farming and food
On the one hand , we have the seed monopolies , and we have seen the disastrous consequences of modified seed in this sector in India
On the other hand , we have the games played by financial organisations with the prices of basic products
In 2008 , we had the biggest global production of cereals
loss of many human lives
We need to monitor these two issues
We need to increase local resources , ensure that farmers have free access to seed and that livestock farmers also pay lower prices , and regulate the operation of financial organisations
(ES) Madam President , livestock farms are suffering the consequences of the crisis
Moreover , they have to comply with the strictest standards in the world , increasing their production prices , with the disadvantage that this gives them in comparison with third countries
I therefore think that the common agricultural policy firstly needs to guarantee sufficient funding after 2013 in order to ensure the viability of agricultural producers and breeders
Secondly , it needs to adopt specific measures for breeders that use sustainable protection measures
Thirdly , it needs to strengthen the measures to support the livestock sector in the most disadvantaged areas
Fourthly , it needs to stipulate that imports from third countries meet EU standards in order to prevent unfair competition
Finally , I ask the Commission to defend the interests of European producers in all trade negotiations , in order not to endanger the production of the livestock sector
Failing to adopt these measures could mean that Europe becomes a region without a sector that is dependent on imports and third countries
Madam President , the crisis in the EU's livestock sector has hit farmers hard in Scotland and there are many things we could do to help
Firstly , we could reduce the regulatory burden
It is madness that we apply more stringent red tape and regulation to our own EU producers than we apply to our competitors outside the EU
offence in the EU
The high cost of complying with all of this red tape is not reflected in the prices our beef farmers are getting for their cattle
a long spiral of decline
We have to stop the rot
(PT) The increase in cereal prices is another factor that is adding to and exacerbating the crisis in the livestock sector
effects of the increasing costs of the factors of production and the volatility of agricultural product prices: they worsen them instead
This volatility has causes that are not only , or even mostly , natural: amongst these is speculation on foodstuffs
Any measures that are taken in this area will always be limited in scope if they do not include banning the instruments that make it profitable , specifically derivatives
Safeguarding production , the right to produce , and food sovereignty and security require an end to the subjugation of agriculture and food production to the market and competitiveness
small number of large producers
the stability of our regions: I am talking about the livestock sector
common agricultural policy
Parliament will also be able to discuss these proposals as early as next week
We will doubtless also address in them the issue of the fair distribution of aid among the various sectors , including the livestock sector
We will also address the issues of support for the livestock sector in more specific and more difficult areas and of mechanisms for managing income volatility
However , some specific questions have been asked which I should like to answer
The first one concerns the problem of cereal prices and intervention stocks
It is true that we no longer have the intervention stocks we had in the past , but this is because prices are higher now
Market intervention cannot be justified when prices are high
stock on the market that we had in the past
This issue should perhaps be dealt with at an even broader level than the European level alone , given that the market is now more open than in the past
the resources to intervene in the agricultural sector
been used , because there has been no need to use it
Even with this transfer , however , I can assure you that we have the budget we need to be able to apply the requisite measures
more extensively , for derived products and commodities alike
I am working with my colleague , Mr Barnier , on this issue
The Commission will present some proposals
later than next week
I have received four motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure
The debate is closed
The vote will take place shortly
Written statements (Rule 149)
in writing
for farmers
fires in Russia , for example
consequences of these cataclysms
What is certain is that we can and must restrict speculation in cereals , which is also one of the causes of these difficulties
It is intolerable that such dishonest dealings cause losses for a sector that is one of the foundation stones of European agriculture
a new trade agreement and to ensure the conditions for fair competition
I call upon the Commission to begin working actively to help European farmers to overcome the existing difficulties in the livestock sector , as our support is vital for farmers
prices for meat
If we are to put in place a lasting policy for the livestock sector , we must take into consideration all the stakeholders , including farmers , consumers and the animals themselves
The objective must be to move away from industrial-scale livestock farming and towards more natural , respectful treatment of animals on small farms
products from animals , in particular , with regard to their origin and the way in which the animals are reared
economically viable , despite the fact that we have the strictest animal welfare standards in the world
The increase in cereal prices is also a threat to the livestock sector in the EU on account of its dependence on feed imported from third countries
in the EU
Europe should therefore reduce its dependence on the import of feed from third countries
It is surely no solution to switch to genetically modified feeds imported from the US
also adopting strict measures in this area
In the US , on the other hand , approval takes only 15 months
The crisis in the EU livestock sector must not be exploited for the commercial ends of US companies , which see significant export potential in the European market
The European Union should aim to reduce production costs , to ensure that third countries comply with EU standards , and to ensure that producers get a decent price for their products
It is not acceptable for consumers to bear the consequences of higher prices , for producers to receive ever less money and for distributors to make ever greater profits
of food security
European livestock farmers have been facing ever-growing difficulties recently
are always victims of the European Union's commercial negotiations
as a result of commercial agreements
taking into account production costs
by the crisis

Finally , to conclude , I would like to welcome the fact that this motion for a resolution makes special mention of pork and poultry , sectors that do not receive direct EU
At present , the EU livestock sector is experiencing difficulties caused by a range of factors , including rising production costs , competition from imports from third countries , and , of course , various
Although we have no control over droughts in Australia or severe weather conditions that affect the grain harvest in Russia , I do believe that Europe urgently needs to tackle its
However , the situation at present is that we are forced to import a lot of our feed and I have said many times before that I strongly believe that
But I have to say that ultimately , it will be the consumer who will pay because , if all the farmers stop producing , you are going to have to import
In the growing context of volatile raw materials prices , decision making is becoming very complex for feed manufacturers and livestock breeders , as we saw at the start of the
Therefore , I will focus my speech on the serious problems it is facing: the increase in the cost of animal feed , which represents 60% of production costs , and is
In two months , cereal prices have risen by 50% , not due to an imbalance between supply and demand , as there is sufficient production , but due to speculation from outside the
The Commission is very much aware of the problem , but there is a lack of specific measures , which we hope will materialise in the future common agricultural policy , through
Madam President , my answer will be in two parts , because the problem in the livestock sector relates primarily to the food situation and , hence , to the situation in the cereals
In the European Union , average cereal production is estimated at 276 million tonnes , and if we add to that the stock from the start of the harvest , we have
8 million tonne batch has just been set aside for the implementation of the 2011 programme to help the poorest citizens , and the rest will be sold on the internal
With regard to the situation in the cereals market , then , no emergency measure can be justified because , as I explained to you , the problem is not one of supplying
We shall see how the rate between the dollar and the euro changes , and depending on that change , if we have surpluses in the internal market , we can then
As for the issue of transparency in the food chain , I am currently examining it with Commissioner Tajani to see how more information in this area could help clarify
Its aim is to put in place fair market conditions for the European livestock industry , which will help to ensure food security for more than 500 million people in
We must ensure that the European agricultural sector is not confronted with new and highly detailed production regulations on a daily basis and that farmers are not required to
Therefore , I am grateful to all the 534 Members of this House who voted in Strasbourg in favour of requiring agricultural imports to comply with European consumer protection , animal welfare
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are here today to call on the Commission to implement suitable efficient and flexible market instruments to combat the crisis into which the
We hope that the proposal that the Commission will shortly present on market instruments for the milk and dairy sector will also include proposals to limit the impact of price
We believe , for example , that it would be very useful to the livestock sector to review the current ban on the use of animal meal for non-ruminants , for example ,
As you know , this ban was introduced following cases of BSE but now , a few years on , the scientific community agrees in stating that the ban can only be
In the case of non-ruminants , conversely , there is no danger to human health and the environment and we therefore hope that this ban may be overturned with the aim
There are three issues in particular that I wish to highlight: firstly , the necessity that the Commission put in place efficient and flexible markers and measures to curb extreme
It is crucial for the long term viability of the livestock sector overall that the Commission ensure that their actions on trade and agriculture do not compromise European farmers ,
The MEPs took a stand , in Strasbourg , so as to strengthen producers' organisations , to stop speculation on the international markets and to control the influence of businesses in the
However , the welfare of animals involves costs , and those costs are borne by the farmers , and there is a problem with unfair competition where meat products are imported into
We should introduce these standards here , but we should also resolutely demand high standards - the same as we have in the Union - from all those who export
The decision must be taken to stop this wholesale liberalisation of agricultural markets , which results in farmers earning , as someone mentioned just now , between EUR 700 and EUR 800
Make the decision to stop these excessive imports and stop the negotiations on that dreadful agreement to import 400 000 tonnes of beef from the Mercosur countries , as it would
It is apparent to those of us who are from rural constituencies , and those who sit on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , that the current position that
This is not an attempt to cry wolf , but if we do not rectify the problems identified within the motion , we will , as a consequence , face higher food prices and
Countries like China and the United States are all increasingly aware of the importance of food supply security and , as a result , are continuing to increase the support which
As long as the cost of inputs keeps rising , and extra-regulatory requirements continue to increase , then many farmers will exit the industry , resulting in land abandonment , lack of economic
The Commission is carrying on the negotiations and , regardless of the utterances of the Trade Commissioner , producers in Northern Ireland so far believe that the results can only be negative

At a time when farmers will find it difficult to provide feed for their animals during winter , a huge number of them will choose to slaughter their animals , which

We need a strong common agricultural policy which is well financed and well managed , and which can accommodate both structural development and modernisation measures , as well as market and
This situation has a number of causes that are very clearly spelt out in the text of the resolution that we are debating today , the most important of which
New instruments must be found in the short and medium terms , for combating speculation in particular; in fact , the Commissioner has just said that that is the crux of
I therefore call on the Commission to take into account the recommendations made in the resolution signed by several political groups , including my own , because action is needed , in

We have producers in this area running the two systems side-by-side before the deadline to try to recoup some of the GBP 400 million pounds we have spent complying
However , we have no such stocks , and this is not only bad for producers and consumers , but it also means that the European Union is deprived of the opportunity
Thirdly , the fact that the common agricultural policy system is distorted , it over-subsidises grain farmers , and supports neither pig nor poultry farmers or livestock farmers in general , is another

Thirdly , we need a quality policy which focuses , in particular , on products from mountain regions and which provides options for special labelling , so that added value can be obtained
Extremely low interest rates and too much money in search of good deals are leading to an increase in dealing and financial speculation on futures contracts , without any contact
These increases in animal feed prices are causing terrible damage to the already difficult situation of many of our livestock farms , which will be unable to pass on the
Therefore , as has already been said this morning , we need to help organise producers so that they can make their presence felt in their dealings with their customers and ,
How can we explain that , although prices are today increasing again in those countries , we cannot pass on that increase to our producers because , yes , there has been an
Madam President , again we are here having a debate about farmers' incomes being destroyed by markets that are , to be quite frank , slightly dysfunctional in make-up and also cannot cope
Surely it is time our farming and market system was stronger and I hope the Commission and the Commissioner notice yet again that the political groups in this House
For this reason , I support the motion which calls on the European Commission to establish a minimum threshold for the level of unauthorised varieties of GMOs permissible in imports
In 2008 , and here lies the absurdity , unless it is explained by financial games , we had the biggest food crisis , a food crisis that caused social disruption and the
Our farmers are bound hand and foot by red tape , and yet we import vast quantities of foodstuffs produced under welfare and hygiene conditions that would constitute a criminal

- (LV) These days , Europe's livestock farmers are experiencing difficulties that we must all overcome together in order to enable the livestock sector to develop and generate enough revenue
In the last few months , there has been a significant increase in cereal prices , made more acute by extraordinary events , such as the floods in Pakistan and the forest
Of course , we have no influence over these climatic disasters , but it is within our power to draw up legislative proposals that could help Europe's farmers to overcome the
I should additionally like to remind you that it is essential for the Commission to defend the interests of European farmers in its discussions with the Mercosur nations on
The livestock sector presents a number of problems for European farmers , including the rising cost of inputs , competition from third country imports , major fluctuations in feed costs and relatively low
All of this must be combined with the highest possible levels of safety for consumers in the form of comprehensive animal health services and clear labelling of all food
The EU must put in place the basic conditions needed to safeguard the future of our farmers so that they can stay competitive internationally and their businesses can remain
The situation is critical in the area of pork production , where feed accounts for 60% of production costs , but rising costs may gradually threaten all branches of livestock production
In the EU , it takes almost two and a half years to approve such feeds , in Argentina around three years , in Brazil three to five years , and China is
I do not agree with the Commission's view that no urgent measures are required , because we are facing a structural crisis which needs solving , and not only from the perspective
They are finding it difficult to cope with competition from third countries as the latter do not comply with the high standards which local producers comply with , and they
However , we hope that we will see a different attitude adopted by the European Commission in future because it is not normal for European farmers to always lose out
The Commission also needs to be more involved in strengthening producer organisations in all livestock sectors , in order to enable them to negotiate better prices for their products , while
At the same time , I call on the Commission to release as quickly as possible cereals from the intervention stocks to support this sector which has been hit hard

Presentation by the Council of the draft general budget for the 2010 financial year (debate)
The next item is the presentation by the Council of the draft general budget for the 2010 financial year
Mr President , it is a tremendous privilege for me to be here today
It makes me feel very humble and I am delighted to have the chance to present the Council's draft general budget to you
Europe is facing considerable challenges
The economic situation looked significantly more worrying six months ago , but it seems to have stabilised
The risk scenario is more balanced and the risk of being drawn deeper into a downward spiral has reduced
However , we face significant problems in the form of rising unemployment , growing budgetary deficits and increasing debt
In the light of this , there is a great need to maintain public finances that are sustainable in the long term
Many countries have a long way to go to balance their public finances
Demographics will exert huge pressure on public finances
The challenges we face with regard to the climate will require new resources and the redistribution of existing resources
strengthen our competitiveness
The Council's draft , which was adopted unanimously , deals with and contributes to meeting these challenges
It is a disciplined budget and a sound one from the point of view of state finances
It will promote research , education , competitiveness , innovation and the building of infrastructures , and it will promote cohesion
The Council's draft also contains margins for coping with unforeseen events
The logic behind our draft general budget is quite simple
infrastructure and in levelling out wage differences throughout the EU
This is precisely what we have attempted to do
The Council's draft is balanced , while still being ambitious
Compared with the 2009 budget , our commitments have increased by 1
1% and the payment appropriations by nearly 4%
Our draft and the agreement that we want to reach must meet the following fundamental requirements , which were also applied during the Council's first reading
The budget must ensure that the EU's various political priorities for 2010 are adequately financed
We in the EU must be able to react quickly to the challenges that await us
There must be an emphasis on providing European added value
Budgetary discipline and sound economic management are required
Otherwise , we will not be able to take the gradual steps towards balancing public finances once again
It is important to respect the ceilings
The EU must have sufficient flexibility to cope with future needs and unforeseen events
It is vital for the EU budget to have adequate margins
The draft general budget that we are tabling represents EUR 138 billion in commitment appropriations and EUR 121 billion in payment appropriations
budget forecast alerts and activity declarations , and we are looking at the capacity available to implement programmes and measures
The degree of implementation and the absorption capacity have been key factors in our analysis
I will now take a brief look at the individual headings
Sub-heading 1A , research and innovation , is the most important element , and adequate funds have been secured in our draft budget
Another area to which more resources will be directed is projects within the energy and infrastructure sectors
If we adjust for the accounting effects of the economic recovery plan , the increase in this area amounts to around 8%
Eight percent
during the autumn
Under sub-heading 1B , the Council accepted the commitment appropriations proposed by the Commission
represents an increase in payment appropriations of 3
2% compared to 2009
Under heading 2 , the Council is proposing substantial increases with regard to both commitment appropriations and payment appropriations compared with 2009 , by 4
5% and 9
5% , respectively , if we adjust for the accounting effects of the recovery plan
With regard to heading 3 , the Council made only a few small adjustments to the Commission's preliminary draft budget
Sufficient resources will be available for migration policy , including Frontex
the best possible way
The Council therefore secured a margin of around EUR 310 million in its first reading
This is particularly justified in light of the letter of amendment , which includes additional needs in this area
As regards the Emergency Aid Reserve , the Council accepted the Commission's proposal regarding commitment appropriations
The common foreign and security policy is increasing in importance and the Council will therefore ensure that adequate funds are available for this
With regard to administration , the Council made certain targeted reductions in view of the economic situation and the specificities of each institution
The aim is to ensure that administrative expenditure does not increase faster than inflation
The institutions' requests for additional posts for new activities were not accepted , except for the new agencies that are planned for 2010 and for Frontex
and we agreed on a joint statement
bodies
I am sure that such a statement will , fortunately , be forthcoming later in the autumn
Before I close , I would like to mention , and indeed to emphasise , the positive atmosphere that prevailed in our meetings with the European Parliament
I believe that constructive cooperation is the only way to achieve a sound budget
Member of the Commission
- Mr President , it is a great pleasure for me to have an opportunity to speak to you this morning
build on this cooperation in the coming weeks
Economic Recovery Plan , so it is crucial that all three institutions work closely together
less severe than in previous years
However , there are some particular concerns which I would like to highlight
The Commission regrets the Council's cut of EUR 1
8 billion in payment appropriations
not least in relation to pre-accession assistance
The cuts proposed to the administrative support expenditure allowance , the administrative allowance for research and the agencies are particularly harsh
of the agency concerned
The cuts in administrative support expenditure will hamper the implementation of programmes , particularly in the field of research and for external actions
I am hopeful that , in preparing its first reading , Parliament will seek to redress this situation
for agriculture in the upcoming letter of amendment which the Commission will present at the end of October
As announced , the Commission has now presented the budgetary authority with an amending letter to update the needs for Heading 4
Gaza; and the need to consider the establishment of Bananas Accompanying Measures in view of the possible trade agreement that will affect the preferential regime of ACP banana-supplying countries
to promote a successful outcome to the December Copenhagen Climate Change Conference
Under Heading 5 (Administration) , the Commission was particularly modest in its PDB requests with a proposed increase in the Commission's administrative expenditure of only 0
9% compared to 2009
While this point has been acknowledged by the Presidency , it is rather disappointing that the Council has introduced further cuts to the Commission's administrative budget
be constructive and that we will achieve a satisfactory outcome to this budget procedure
Thank you , Mr ≈†emeta , for presenting the position of the Commission , and also for keeping to time , which is very important
I would like to say that this is an initial discussion
We are now going to discuss this in the Committee on Budgets and in other committees , and the main discussion will take place in a few weeks
other areas of public life as well
In that Europe , there is no law preventing anyone from using their mother tongue , not even in Slovakia
through reform measures
Parliament already expressed its point of view in February
It was encouraging that the European Commission and Council expressed their agreement with it
complete success
It is time to face up to the fact that no one is happy with the European Union's budget
The budget's revenue side is a serious burden for Member States , but the sum available is not sufficient for them to achieve their objectives
We are far away from achieving both full employment and a knowledge-based society
We spend large sums on agriculture , but dairy farmers , for instance , are affected by an unmanageable crisis
The biggest item on the expenditure side is the cohesion policy , but the gaps between regions are growing instead of decreasing
Researchers born and trained in Europe are working outside the European Union
We are therefore lagging behind when it comes to innovation as well
We hoped that the crisis would also provide an opportunity for us to have a shake-up and make the European Union's budget more successful and tangible for its citizens
which programmes actually provide value and success for our money
What can we do now
Parliament will endeavour to shape the budget in such a way that its message will be clearer to the EU's citizens
We want to increase those items which help tackle the crisis
With this in mind , we are putting forward our thoughts on implementing the economic stimulus plan
We want to tackle head on the challenges posed by climate change as well
also with every item in the budget , so that Europeans realise that the European Union is not a superfluous expense , but an effective tool for solving their problems
I call on my fellow Members , the Council and Commission to support this
Mr President , Secretary of State , Commissioner , we can surely agree that when drawing up the European Parliament's budget , we must focus on our core mission , which is legislative work
Issues unconnected with this must be excluded from the budget as much as possible
We will discuss the final form of the budget today in an arbitration process involving the Presidency of the European Parliament and the Committee on Budgets
At this point , I would like to thank the representatives of the political groupings
In the meeting of the Committee on Budgets yesterday , they backed proposals to reduce the budget and measures which will lead to the better use of financial resources
We are constantly confronted with numerous shortcomings that prevent us from using our resources in a fully efficient manner
One example of this is the security for the buildings in which we are conducting these debates today
As you know , we spend four days a month in Strasbourg
Despite this , there were security guards stationed at both entrances 365 days a year until recently
The new Secretary General of the European Parliament and his colleagues discovered this and implemented measures which will bring annual savings of more than EUR 2 million
Another example is the Court of Auditors' reports on translations
Insufficient planning and insufficient communication or a complete absence of communication regarding the availability of translation resources prevents these resources being used effectively
The organisation which is supposed to provide translations often instructs external translators automatically without even checking whether there is any spare capacity available in the internal organisation
It is for this reason that we are proposing a reserve of 5% against the resources earmarked for translation in the budgets of the various institutions
We shall release this reserve when they show that they have tried to make full use of the resources of the internal organisation
In the area of translations alone , we can save around EUR 11 million annually
There are many similar examples
Most of them have a common denominator: we are making little use of independent studies into the use of resources and the organisation of work
I believe that the political will shown yesterday by the representatives of the various political groupings in the discussions of the Committee on Budgets will bear fruit
Expenses for the purchase , upkeep and rental of buildings form one of the main administrative expense items of EU institutions
There have been various cases in the past where institutions have purchased or rented property using methods that were not entirely efficient
According to the Court of Auditors , the institutions do not cooperate in these areas or even fail to assess their own policies
We have therefore asked the European Parliament administration to draw up a medium-term strategic document on buildings
We wanted to adopt a sensible decision on this matter in the first reading
better cooperation in this area
Secretary of State , I am delighted that , like us , the Council has adopted this as a priority objective and I would like to express my thanks for that
Mr President , may I first of all congratulate Mr ≈†emeta on the confirmation obtained yesterday of his appointment as Commissioner responsible for the budget
is as brilliant as that of Mrs Grybauskaitƒó
Mr President , we are going through a period of global crisis , of preparation for major diplomatic events and of institutional uncertainty within the Union itself
In a period such as this , the Committee on Budgets will seek to adopt a cooperative attitude
States' public finances prevents them from going much further this year
For the 2010 budget , as has been said , we have an obligation to produce results: namely , balancing the financing of the 2010 section of the recovery plan
We know that redeployments will be necessary , but they must not focus on other political priorities previously decided on together by Parliament and by the Council
Beyond 2010 , Parliament will hope to undertake work jointly with the Commission , the Council , the Swedish Presidency and the future Spanish Presidency on three major issues for the future
the Treaty of Lisbon
The second issue will be the mid-term review of the financial perspective
energy , raw materials and even foodstuffs , and the negotiations on climate change
There has also been - I am sorry to say - the failure of the Lisbon Strategy , as is plain to see today
It is therefore a thorough review of our multiannual guidelines that we need
This will be the first task of the new Commission
Lastly , the third and final issue will be the reform of the resources that make up the European budget
We knew before the crisis that none of the Member States wanted to pay for Europe's spending any more
Since the crisis , none of the Member States can pay for this spending any more
Our financial contribution to the economic recovery will represent scarcely 0
03% of the Union's GDP
put itself in a position to propose some areas of work so as to launch the debate next year
Mr President , we have heard from both the Commission and the European Parliament that we will have several difficult issues to deal with during the autumn
Hopefully , we will have some easy ones to deal with , too
One of the most difficult issues is going to be the recovery plan and how it is to be financed
At the same time , I am very hopeful that we will succeed
I know that we will succeed
There is no alternative
Another issue that we face , both in the short term and in the long term , is , of course , the climate and the financing of climate policy
Finally , I would like to take the opportunity to thank you for allowing me to speak here today
The debate is closed
I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on his appointment
Commissioner , great careers await commissioners from Lithuania
We wish you much success , both in the Commission and in the future
Your predecessor is , today , the Head of State in Lithuania
Overall , this means , in our opinion , that the budget that we are to agree on should reflect a high degree of restraint in order to leave room for future
needs , with the emphasis on European added value and investments which , in the short term , can bring us out of the economic crisis and , in the long term , can also
If we want to stimulate growth , employment and prosperity , the textbooks say that we should pursue a sustainable , credible and cautious policy , but with investment in education , research and
The reductions that the Council has made in relation to the preliminary draft budget presented by the Commission are based on a detailed analysis of the budget implementation , the
That is a lot , and as you all know , the financing of the European Economic Recovery Plan will be one of those topics that we will need to discuss
As regards payments , the Council believes that certain reductions can be made in relation to the preliminary draft budget , but I would like to stress that our draft nevertheless
As regards heading 4 , it is extremely important to leave a substantial margin to the ceiling under this heading in order to be able to cope with unforeseen needs in
At our conciliation meeting in July , it was highlighted once again how important it is for the recruitment associated with the enlargements of 2004 and 2007 to be carried out ,
On the same occasion , your representatives indicated that they were willing to try to find a common approach in respect of the building policy of the EU institutions and
I know that the first stages of this budgetary procedure - in particular the July conciliation - took place in a very positive atmosphere , and I hope we can
We still have some way to go in the 2010 budget procedures , and there are other important issues to agree on , such as the second phase of the European
Turning to the actual situation following the Council's first reading and the establishment of the draft budget for 2010 , the Commission acknowledges that the cuts proposed by the Council are
These cuts are proportionately more significant for Headings 1A and 4 , and sent a negative message in the priority areas of growth in jobs and the EU's international role ,
Rather than taking into account the specific situation of each agency , the cuts - with few exceptions - have been general , regardless of the stage of development or tasks
Although the cuts in Headings 1B and 2 are regrettable , I am partly reassured by the Council's proposed declaration on payments and by the second opportunity to examine the needs
The key elements of this concern: an additional EUR 95 million in commitment and EUR 60 million in payment appropriations to support the Palestinian Authority and reconstruction efforts in
There is also an additional EUR 50 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 20 million in payment appropriations to assist developing countries in combating climate change , which should help
In conclusion I am hopeful that the European Parliament will restore the appropriations cut by the Council and I am confident that our ongoing negotiations between the three institutions will
I am going to speak in my mother tongue because I am hoping for a Europe where this act is a natural right in every parliament , not to mention in
I also expected that the current financial crisis would not only reduce production and increase unemployment , but also provide us with an opportunity to improve the European Union's budget
Based on what I know about the draft , I am sad to say that the attempt to translate the fine words into the language of numbers was not a
We also hoped to use the budget not only in compliance with the rules and without any corruption , but also to take a look at the expenses and consider
What we would like is for the financial crisis to be tackled effectively , not only using a couple of billion euros from the plan earmarked for this purpose , but
There is a need to draw up a joint policy on buildings , not only in the European Parliament , but also within the framework of all institutions , and to ensure
We are convinced that we will enjoy the same quality of relations with him as those which we established with his predecessor , and we wish him a political career that
As our rapporteur said , we regret the cuts made by the Council in the Commission's proposals but , at the same time , we understand that the state of the Member
If , of course , things turn out as we hope in Ireland , the first issue will be the implementation of the procedure , schedule and working methods required by the application of

EU 2020 - Follow-up of the informal European Council of 11 February 2010 (debate)
The next item is the debate on the statement of the Council and the Commission: EU 2020 - Follow-up of the informal European Council of 11 February 2010
President Van Rompuy , as this is your first speech in the plenary session of the European Parliament , we agreed that it could be slightly longer
President Van Rompuy would like to present to this House his points of view on other issues , on institutional issues , at the beginning of his term of office
Perhaps 15 to 20 minutes will be enough for you
President of the European Council
meet with you early in my mandate
before the end of April , some five months after my designation as President of the European Council
Let me therefore take this opportunity to lay out how I see my role and function
I shall spend a few minutes on this so as not to have to return to this on future occasions
There has , of course , always been a Presidency of the European Council; not the same thing as the 'President of Europe' , as some media put it
So what has changed
Three small things , but which will , together and over time , have the potential to make a significant difference
First is the element of continuity: past presidents changed every six months; that is , after every second or third meeting
There was little opportunity to develop a long-term strategy
Our partners in third countries were bemused at having to meet a different Head of Government every time they had a summit with the European Union
Greater continuity is fundamental to building relationships and carrying out a serious task
Second is the full-time nature of the job; previous presidents had to simultaneously manage their own national governments
This meant that , at best , they could only deal half-time with European affairs
its role within the European institutional system
Third is the fact that Heads of State or Government now choose who they want to hold this position rather than it happening haphazardly from an arbitrary rotation system
I hope this , too , augurs well for the support that the President can count on
they give the European Council a better chance of fulfilling its task under the treaties of '[defining] the general political directions and priorities [of the Union]'
Some commentators have seen a great deal more in this role; others have seen less
for instance , France
Others , on the other hand , see it as the mere chairmanship of the meeting of the Heads of Government
In reality , it is neither
It is certainly not a President and not with executive powers in its own right
The incumbent must express the views of the collective Heads of State or Government
its meetings
- and the role as a bridge between the national capitals and institutions clearly go beyond the task of merely chairing meetings
The role of permanent President is to enhance a shared sense of direction: nothing more , nothing less
Where are we going
How to deal with our neighbours
Who are our main strategic partners in the world
Where do we want to be in 10 or 20 years' time
These are vital issues
As regards my relationship with the European Parliament , the treaty is quite brief on this: it simply requires that I report to you 'after [
] meetings of the European Council'
10
It will not be long before many of you will be fed up with the sight of me
with the President of Parliament
Indeed , my role should not be confused with that of the President of the Commission
Mr Barroso chairs an executive that is elected by and is accountable to the European Parliament
It submits legislative and budgetary proposals to you , I do not do so
The Commission President has an intimate day-to-day contact with the European Parliament , not least working on those legislative and budgetary proposals
development and in terms of its external relations
I have a weekly meeting with President Barroso
We are both acutely aware of the need to avoid any conflicts of competence or misunderstandings as to who is responsible for what
very confident that we are on the right track
In this context , it is also important to remember that I am President of the European Council and not of the Council of Ministers; these are two separate institutions
among the Member States
High Representative for Foreign Policy
I pause at this point to pay tribute to the work being done by Catherine Ashton
In facing up to multiple challenges in the field of foreign affairs and security and in preparing the External Action Service , she deserves our support
It will be my privilege to work closely with her in representing the Union externally
Let me just say a few words about the European Council itself
The first formal meeting under my chairmanship will take place at the end of next month
We did , however , have a useful informal gathering of Heads of State or Government earlier this month at the Biblioth√®que Solvay , just a few hundred metres from here
Whether it was because of the more intimate surroundings of the library or the physical proximity of Parliament , our discussions were fruitful
As I said , I cannot report any formal conclusions to you from an informal meeting
and which I know has been circulated within Parliament
crisis
governance of these issues
the European Union
Our initial exchange of views on this involved looking at how we set targets , how we follow them up , how we evaluate results
It is in large part about coordinating the exercise of national competences whilst making full use of the European Union competences and instruments available
It is therefore a task to which the European Council is eminently suited
in the euro area - and for micro-economic policy
A lot of this is very technical , but let us just take the idea of bringing down the number of common economic objectives to concentrate on four or five
These objectives should be quantifiable and divisible in national set objectives; it makes no sense to have scoreboards on , say , 65 different sets of data
Moreover , all members of the European Council are willing to take more responsibility in a common European strategy for growth and jobs
Such personal involvement is indispensable; we need to go from paper recommendations to real-life commitment
I was glad to find such a level of ambition around the table
Whether you want to call it better coordination , better governance , or even a gouvernement √©conomique , the key is the common commitment to success
implementing Article 214 of the Treaty on the coordination of humanitarian aid
A discussion on how Europe should respond strategically to the Copenhagen conference on climate change will be pursued at the next European Council
Unexpectedly , of course , there was a discussion on the situation in Greece
approval of all 27 Heads of State or Government as well as the President of the Commission and the President of the European Central Bank
This degree of consensus was a message about Greece's acceptance of its responsibility to cut its deficit in a credible way and of our solidarity with it if needed
I very much look forward to hearing your views on all these matters , not least on how we can face all the challenges facing our Union
own social model and externally to defend our interests and project our values
I think that all European institutions can , and must , work together for those goals
(Applause)
President of the Commission
- Mr President , let me first of all congratulate President Van Rompuy on what was a very good informal European Council for the first time under his chairmanship
After reaching agreement among all of us on an important statement on Greece , we discussed the Europe 2020 strategy - a strategy for sustainable growth and employment
I had the opportunity to focus on the substantive policy issues we are facing , on the challenges , and on the lines which the Commission will formally propose next Wednesday
Before the crisis , the European economy was making progress: we saw 18 million new jobs and a more dynamic business environment
year , unemployment shooting up to 10% , a huge hit to our prosperity , a real threat to our societies
At the same time , the task is getting tougher: we have an ageing population , a growing productivity gap with our competitors , and failings in education and research
However , we also have many strengths: we have the world's biggest market economy; we have the single market; we have the euro area
All this has proved to be an important asset in the crisis
But today , Europe faces a very important choice; I would say a defining choice for future generations
Hoping for a return of the good old days is no option
One option is limited change - the lowest common denominator which brings some reform and some growth
But we could never get back what we lost in the crisis
This option would result in a Europe which is second class in the new global order
Minimal changes , some kind of adaptations
I believe we can and must be more ambitious
We can aspire to an economic strategy that puts Europe on the path to competitiveness and that can create millions of new jobs
But this cannot be done by half measures and incremental change
We need to instil a sense of urgency , a recognition that business as usual will not protect our European way of life and will not defend our social models
On the contrary
Those social models will be put at risk if we do not adapt to a much more challenging global environment
This requires a joint effort
the European Parliament , for shaping this strategy and for communicating it to the people
Next week , the Commission will set out the key elements of the strategy that it will formally propose to the European institutions
It will centre on three priorities: smart growth , inclusive growth , sustainable growth
First , the core driver of growth must be knowledge; knowledge and innovation that produces tomorrow's ideas , tomorrow's skills , tomorrow's technologies
Second , to keep in force our European model of society , we need to deliver more jobs
Our goal must be healthy , prosperous , secure societies , where everyone feels they can play their part
That means giving people jobs and skills and it means tackling the scourge of poverty head on
The problem of poverty is not only a national problem; it is a problem for which we need a common European response
Our social market economy must be hardwired to seize the opportunities of the future
I am talking about sustainable growth , recognising the importance of tackling climate change , recognising the pressure on resources
in a globalised market place
These priorities are not unfamiliar
But the fact that we have not yet succeeded in realising these goals makes them more important , not less
Where we need to make a radical change is not in our prescription of what the European economy needs , but in our approach on how to make it happen
What do we need in order to succeed
Firstly , the strategy must be comprehensive
We cannot have a pick-and-mix strategy allowing everyone to do the easy parts , the feel-good things , and leave the real challenges to the others
of intense pressure on public finances , to name but a few
Secondly , our strategy must engage all parts of our societies
We will not succeed in putting European society on the right track for the future if this comes at the cost of social conflict
That is why a proactive approach to creating jobs and addressing the scourge of poverty are essential
It is also why we have been wise to reform financial markets
aid at the time of need; one which accepts that effective supervision at European level is necessary today
Thirdly , we must not confuse having an overall vision for the European economy with the question of 'who does what
'
It should not be a question of a debate on competences
What we have to see is the added value of a European approach
we proposed to the American President to accept those summits
It is indeed necessary to recognise that we have greater influence if we act together
It makes no sense to recognise global interdependence and to reject European interdependence
That is why we need to act together
Still , a lot of action will have to come at national level
Of course , there are national responsibilities which we expect to be addressed mainly by governments , but we also expect governments to commit sincerely to a European approach
societies so that they can bring more prosperity , more well-being to our citizens
We will only succeed if we are ready to work together , not against each other , and therefore we need credible ownership at all levels
We need strong and true coordination in the economic field
The Lisbon Treaty gives us these instruments and we will use them
In this European Council , I saw awareness of this problem
I can compare the discussions this time with the discussions five years ago when we were discussing the Lisbon Strategy
of the external constraints on the European economy
I sincerely hope that this time , narrow national interests will not again resist the need for closer coordination and an effective system of European governance
We also need significant European Union level flagship measures to typify what we are trying to achieve: some concrete plans
Union is not just talking , it is acting
every corner of the European Union
I would like to welcome on his first appearance in the plenary session of the European Parliament
Mr Van Rompuy , the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) expects a lot of you
expect you and the Council of Ministers to be aware that with the Treaty of Lisbon , your relations with us , the MEPs , have changed
We are equal decision makers , and that has not only legal consequences , but political ones as well
and budgetary policy , since speculation against the Greek debt and the euro were certainly unexpected guests in the Solvay library
by those who are unhappy about its power and that of the Member States involved
Secondly , are we going to wait until the situation in certain euro area countries deteriorates before we react , as we did with Greece
If not , what plans are there to put things right in the countries most at risk
A question for you there , President Van Rompuy
I ask these questions because , while I am happy with the solidarity measures taken on 11 February , I seriously doubt whether we Europeans are really on top of the situation
currency , the euro , reflects the political power behind it
effective if we devised and implemented real budgetary coordination of the euro area members
and has spoken in favour of the national budgets of the euro area States being approved by the Eurogroup even before being submitted to the national parliaments
I would like to take up this bold idea , and I ask the European Council to consider it and to analyse it seriously
By properly coordinating their budgets , the euro area States would acquire unprecedented influence and room for manoeuvre
international financial organisations , where the euro must speak with one voice
weight of the states
With these criteria , the United States enjoys 16
7% of the voting rights , Japan 6% , China 3
6% and the six founding members of the European Union 18
49%
united , would represent 32% of the votes , that is to say , twice as many as the United States
Presidents , ladies and gentlemen , that is the reality of the balance of power in the world
However , because it is still divided , Europe is unable to punch its full weight
Can we tolerate this any more
The PPE Group does not think so
It is time , President Van Rompuy , for the euro area countries to open their eyes to this state of affairs and to learn from it
is nothing but a dangerous pretence
on behalf of the S&D Group
- Mr President , since the start of the economic and social crisis , over seven million people have joined the unemployment lines in Europe
By the end of this year , it is quite likely that over 25 million people will be unemployed
two years
Despite costly recovery measures , all we have managed to avoid so far is a complete collapse of the system
Economic growth remains extremely weak , and many people have lost faith in the idea of an early recovery
become the targets of ruthless and uncontrolled speculation
The crisis has gravely undermined Europe's global competitiveness and weakened its political influence
That is the gloomy landscape in which Europe now needs to reinvent its future in order to safeguard its model of economic and social development
President Barroso , you are going to be asking the Spring Council where we want Europe to be in 2020
of finding a new job
What answers can you give them
I cannot go back to my region tomorrow and tell my people that they do not need to worry , that we have a plan for 2020
jobs will soon start to be created and that these jobs will be decent jobs with decent salaries
At the moment , the only medium-term policy agenda is that set down by the European Council in December: the consolidation of public finances
By 2011 , Member States are expected to start consolidation to bring their public deficits within the 3% limit within two years
At the same time , unemployment will still be rising; growth will be too weak to bring unemployment down
crisis
I would urge President Van Rompuy and President Barroso to reconsider the nature of the so-called exit strategy
terms
This will not be the case if macro-economic policy is totally focused on rapid consolidation
That would mean cuts in public investment , in education and training , in social and in health services
Consolidation cannot be achieved through tax rises alone
would become long-term unemployed
Europeans deserve a more balanced and socially responsible policy approach
years up to 2015
by 2015 , particularly in the green economy
The European Council should state this intention clearly at the March summit as a key objective of the new strategy
of key public spending in growth areas and key social policies
This will demand a political leap in thinking with regard to Europe's - and , in particular , the eurozone's - economic governance
the EU for decision by the December 2010 Council
We need to challenge the old way of doing things if we want to learn lessons from the current crisis and make it history as soon as possible
This is a chance to make Europe relevant to people and not just to markets
agenda
project
on behalf of the ALDE Group
- Mr President , first of all , let me come directly to what I would call the most urgent problem today
We can talk about 2020 , but we have a more urgent problem today: the eurozone and Greece
We have to find solutions to that
I think we , the European Parliament , have to take the initiative in this field
It is important to determine what exactly happened in Greece
Today , we received contradictory information
Greece says that it has given all the information to the European Union and European institutions
At the same time , the European Commission and Eurostat are saying that they did not receive all the necessary information
At the same time the investment banks - Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , Deutsche Bank - are minimising what they have done in the Greece case
on this matter and find out exactly what is happening in the case of Greece
in 2008 and 2009 and before that , and I think it is absolutely necessary that the different parties are heard by this Parliament
The second point is that we also have to tackle the problem of the Greek debt
I think there is only one good solution to that
German press
costs to the European taxpayer , but with a solution for the future
of the current Member States of the European Union to examine this possibility
Thirdly , I think the most important part of this debate is , naturally , what to do about 2020
I think Greece is a very good example of what went wrong with the Lisbon Strategy
Lisbon Strategy
was not a good method; it was too weak a method
We need a bolder instrument inside the European Union
This bolder instrument is economic governance inside the European Union
this
I hope it will include a bolder strategy than the things that were concluded or not concluded at the informal summit
It is still an intergovernmental , open-coordination method
They make it a little bit better , a little bit faster , but at the end , it continues to be an open coordination method based on intergovernmentalism
with a bold proposal to have economic governance inside the European Union
It is nonsense to have monetary union on the one hand and not to have an economic and social and political union on the other
The problems with Greece are proof of that
(Applause)
far more ambitious than the - in my view - disappointing conclusions of the informal summit
(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))
eurozone
Is that what you are advocating
on behalf of the ALDE Group
fiscal deficit of Greece
(Applause)
The fiscal deficit is , if I am not mistaken , 12
9% of GDP for the moment
but the day after tomorrow - there will come a time when Britain is a member of the eurozone
Be sure
Mr President , I hope that the British kindergarten will be kind enough to listen for a moment
(Heckling)
the right of this House
I believe that what is least helpful in the dispute over the situation in , and the prospects for , Greece is an anti-Greek , nationalistic or anti-European attitude
good times
I would like to pick up on an issue raised by Mr Verhofstadt
- probably even during the entire preparatory period for the monetary union
Mr Barroso , I believe that you have a crucial share of the responsibility in this regard
not seen the system of irresponsibility that lies beneath it
Secondly , a lot needs to change in Greece , too
We need to have a - preferably friendly - discussion with Greece about this within the euro area
to rule it out in any way at this point - then Greece needs to make some real changes
There is the excessive public sector , for example
public sector
It is definitely in need of reform
However , it is not only in terms of expenditure that changes need to be made , as there is clearly something very wrong with the revenue side as well
I think that Mr Papandreou has the right idea with his intention to publish the tax declarations of the high earners in Greece
It is not necessary to buy CDs from Switzerland; there is another way to go about this
Greece who are living in the lap of luxury pay their taxes like decent citizens
My colleague , Mr Giegold , will probably talk more about the Eurobonds later
I would just like to say one sentence about the EU 2020 strategy
Mr Barroso , you made absolutely no mention of the failures of the Lisbon Strategy
I believe that the failure to evaluate the Lisbon Strategy does not bode at all well for the success or possible success of the new strategy
As an integrated strategy , it is , in principle , not bad , but
(The President cut off the speaker)
on behalf of the ECR Group
- Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Verhofstadt for reminding us all of the failure of left-wing economic policies in the United Kingdom
We are very grateful for the advice and I hope my colleagues and I will be able to remedy that in the forthcoming general election
Even before the recent crisis , the economies of Europe were losing ground to our major rivals and competitors
Our growth level was less , our unemployment higher , our relative trading position was in decline and our share of global output falling
We had launched the Lisbon Strategy , but without enough conviction or commitment; unsurprisingly , it has not succeeded
Europe 2020 must not go the same way
I am very pleased that my group was among the first to submit proposals to help with its progress
We now need to set a new course for our economies
We must recognise that governments do not create productive jobs or raise living standards
Only competitive business and successful entrepreneurs can do that
Our Member States and the institutions of the European Union then need to support them by reducing the burdens they face
We cannot expect to have dynamic economies if we make even greater demands on those who are generating growth and jobs by imposing heavy tax regimes and bureaucratic regulations
We need to encourage more research and development , improved higher education and better vocational training , as President Barroso has just emphasised
The internal market needs to be reinvigorated and extended to new fields
The stakes could not be higher
economic prosperity have marched together
We are now entering a new era
By the end of this century , considerable economic power may have shifted to states with undemocratic governments
That authoritarian capitalism may not evolve gently into the democratic and responsible capitalism we enjoy today in Europe and the West
We hope those states will liberalise
We will offer them friendly encouragement to do so , but we know the risks
interests of the free world that the 2020 programme points the way to a stronger economic future for all our citizens
Mr President , in times of need , you discover who your friends are , as the saying goes
There are 27 governments in the European Union trying - each in its own way - to rescue their own banks and large-scale industries
This has so far resulted in more debt for each individual country and catastrophic savings rates for citizens
The euphemistic wage restraint policy , reducing non-wage labour costs and the privatisation of life risks such as age , family , sickness and desired education have all been mentioned
The banks are now using the state rescue packages to speculate against the national budgets
The banks have already made more progress than the states
excessively expensive government bonds in Greece
people are fleeing
(Heckling)
Believe me , I find no pleasure in using negative examples from Germany
However , one governing party in Germany is constantly calling for tax relief , while at the same time , the Greek Government is being called on to increase taxes
Who will have to find this money , though
I fear that it will primarily be those who are already finding it hard to make ends meet
Was it not Germany , formerly the world's highest exporter , that years ago separated wage increases from productivity , thus resulting in social dumping
In ancient Greek theatre , a crisis means an opportunity - yes , the challenge of a turning point
In order to bring about such a turning point , we must demand that a statutory minimum wage finally be put in place
The same work in the same place must receive the same wage
finance policy , coordinated on the basis of solidarity , with binding social and environmental targets
on behalf of the EFD Group
- President of Europe - this long-awaited day
people; the man that would represent all of us on the world stage; the man whose job was so important that of course , you are paid more than President Obama
Well , I am afraid what we got was you
And I am sorry , but after that performance that you gave earlier
I do not want to be rude , but you know , really , you have the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk
(Protests)
The question that I want to ask and that we are all going to ask is: who are you
I had never heard of you; nobody in Europe had ever heard of you
I would like to ask you , Mr President: who voted for you
(Loud protests)
And what mechanism - I know democracy is not popular with you lot - what mechanism do the peoples of Europe have to remove you
Is this European democracy
of the European nation states
much a non-country
(Reactions)
But since you took over , we have seen Greece reduced to nothing more than a protectorate
in saying: we do not know you , we do not want you , and the sooner you are put out to grass , the better
As you said , Mr Chair , you would not like to be rude
I prefer to go ahead
Mr Chair , will you take a blue card question
Mr Farage , are you willing to apply Article 9 of the treaty to ask to simply leave Europe
That way , you will be happy
Mr President , I am very disappointed in you , Mr Buzek
It is unacceptable for a group chair to call the President of the European Council a 'damp rag' in this Parliament , rather than offering political criticism
(Applause)
Mr President , I would expect you to respond to that with a call to order
It is not acceptable for this man to freely trample the dignity of this House underfoot
To Mr Daul , I would like to say that it is not a question of the United Kingdom leaving the EU
It would perhaps be better for Mr Farage to relinquish his mandate if he finds the European Union and the European Parliament so objectionable
(Applause)
Parliament
When I spoke with Mr Farage about this , I pointed this out to him
I would like to say , Mr Schulz , that I have done and am doing just as you suggest
You may not like what I say , but just consider your behaviour
had behaved as a group in the Parliament like Hitler and the Nazis in the Reichstag
We have been called mentally weak by Danny Cohn-Bendit
You know , it has to be
It cannot be one way
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr Farage , I am sorry but it was not a personal statement
We must keep order and all the regulations of our Parliament
(NL) First of all , allow me to state calmly the fact that we are conducting this debate in this Chamber , in Brussels , in Belgium
Greece and Italy , the largest government debt in percentage terms in the whole of Europe
Mr Verhofstadt , former Prime Minister of Belgium
When it comes to fraud and artificially inflating the budget , he could even teach the Greeks a thing or two
However , let us not get too worked up about that
government loan , which is a bill that somebody will have to foot sooner or later
the Stability and Growth Pact out of the window all for the sake of appearances , because Europe had to be seen to move forward
It is also that same Eurocrat obstinacy which is now ramming Turkey's accession strategy down our throats
is not even European
The solution is not 'more Europe'
The solution is national responsibility and the obligation of individual Member States to cut their coats according to their cloth
(NL) President Buzek , President Barroso and , of course , also President Van Rompuy , we are delighted to have you here with us today
intended in the Treaty of Lisbon
I should like to congratulate you on this in advance
It is important that you are here in connection with the forthcoming 2020 strategy , because it is crucial for re-establishing Europe's role in the world
Mr President , and here I address President Barroso as well , you know what our priorities are
They centre on a green , social , market economy
This means that our foremost task should be to get small and medium-sized enterprises , as the powerhouse behind our job creation , back on their feet again
We are not talking about just our trade and services here , but also about our European industry , which we have to make competitive again on the world stage
We are also talking about our agricultural sector and high-quality food production , which are also competitive on the world stage
That means that we need SMEs with knowledge , innovation and sustainable technology at their core
The 2020 strategy must be built on such a foundation
spending
Mr President , the old Lisbon Strategy contained too many vague objectives and demonstrated the failure of the open coordination method
while remaining within the limits of the Treaty of Lisbon when it comes to subsidiarity
(SV) Mr President , according to the Commission's own figures , 80 million EU citizens are currently living below the poverty line
That is indecent and it is also an obstacle to all other development
a great many important matters to debate
He should be given a time-out and should not be permitted to attend next week's session in Strasbourg
It would be a mild punishment for the behaviour he has exhibited
Our task now is to produce a new Lisbon Strategy , in other words , EU 2020
In this context , it is important to realise that social cohesion and sustainable development are essential for economic growth
The first society to get away from our dependence on fossil fuels , for example , will take the lead in the creation of new green jobs
However , we need resources if this is to succeed
Green Deal capable of creating these new green jobs
The Seventh and Eighth Framework Programmes must concentrate on research and development relating to renewable energy
The Commission must also make vigorous efforts to prevent the social exclusion that is currently taking place around Europe and to strengthen the parties of the labour market
In recent years , the EU has rightly begun to be seen as a threat to the trade union movement
This needs to change
generating so much anger and so much conflict
We have had enough of that here today in Parliament
Mr President , the aim of EU 2020 should be to free the potential of the European citizen
All too often we forget that our strategies for growth are put in place for the benefit of our citizens and the future of our children
There is no doubt that the Lisbon Strategy failed when it attempted to include everything
With such a broad agenda , the focus was lost and so were the possibilities to achieve the ambitious goals that were set
For the 2020 strategy to be more effective , the format needs to be changed into something completely different
The work should be targeted at the few specific areas where the fundamentals of sustainable growth should be addressed
As the only directly elected body of the EU , and with full codecision powers in place , this Parliament will have its say in the 2020 strategy
In order to ensure legitimacy and openness , the Commission and the Council will therefore be wise to include Parliament in the ongoing work of the 2020 strategy
countries across the Union
Everyone is pointing their fingers at Greece but there are also other Member States that have avoided benchmarking , deceived Europe about their deficits and cheated with their financial statistics
The method of open coordination has turned into a closed collusion and open humiliation
Remember , what is true for citizens is also true for governments
Freedoms also bring responsibilities
It is now time for governments across Europe to take that responsibility seriously because the problems we face are serious
at least ambitious
Ambitious , firstly , as regards the reduction of our ecological footprint
Therefore , this is not just about the climate and , from that point of view , returning to the 20% figure is , in our view , far below what is really required
Not even 30% is ambitious
achieve
An ambitious goal with regard to education , research , development and innovation , and , of course , an ambitious goal with regard to job creation
These goals , as has already been mentioned , must be measurable and must be binding; whether it is a bonus-malus system or something else matters little , but we need results
However , we will not achieve these results without two absolutely vital ingredients
Council worry us greatly
As regards the second ingredient , I would like to stress what Mr Daul said
Indeed , Mr Daul , Member States will have to abandon more of their sovereignty , in particular in the fiscal area
I wonder where the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) stands on that
Without strong fiscal convergence , we will be unable to bring stability back to our public finances and build our tax system on a sustainable basis
We are thinking of energy , we are thinking , of course , of taxation on financial transactions
and competitive advantages and use all tools and resources available , particularly in the area of R&D , to create real EU added value
research
industry and technologies
We must , however , remain vigilant against legislation that serves to hinder these developmental processes
We need to improve the link between private sector and academic research and work to facilitate the transfer of knowledge into job- and wealth-creating enterprises
As well as improving the availability of finance for innovation , we need to ensure a reduced administrative burden , particularly for SMEs and micro-entities
Following SME-friendly procurement policies and allowing SMEs to participate in public/private partnerships will be a start
An EU 2020 strategy focused on innovation in areas of existing expertise
(The President cut off the speaker)
(EL) Mr President , huge unemployment rallies are being held in Greece today by workers in the private and public sectors
of accepting that the Treaty of Lisbon has failed resoundingly , the Council is preparing the 2020 European Commission as an expansion and continuation of the treaty
You are treating Greece as a scapegoat , dictating measures against the workers , who are not to blame for the crisis , that will usher in similar measures for other countries
The people of Greece and the people of Europe will shortly deal with you as the people of Argentina dealt with the International Monetary Fund
(LT) It is symbolic that 20 years after the fall of the wall that divided Europe , today we are talking about Europe 2020
Firstly , I would like to approve the fundamental priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy: knowledge and innovation , a society of high employment and a competitive and sustainable economy
I propose that we add two more priorities - infrastructure development and an effective energy policy
supply routes , we must not forget the important Rail Baltica and Via Baltica projects which are important not only to Lithuania
I believe that while preparing a new strategy , we must assess the reasons we failed to achieve the goals outlined in the Lisbon Strategy
We must not only set out new strategy goals and tasks , but turn discussions that sometimes last too long into concrete action with precise deadlines
(ES) Madam President , I believe that this crisis is an opportunity to move forward firmly and with conviction in creating a strong Europe
coordinated and inevitably leads to paralysis and a lack of clarity
We know that the finances and the public deficits of European countries will suffer until we move towards European financial integration and Eurobonds are issued
In any case , the European institutions can already take specific action - I will not focus on all the hot air about coordination
On the one hand , we have the European Central Bank for harmonising financial supervision and on
(Remainder of speech not available for technical reasons)
(DE) Madam President , Mr Barroso , Mr Van Rompuy , if the 2020 strategy is to succeed it must - unlike the Lisbon Strategy - actually be implemented
In contrast to what previous speakers have said , the goals were not wrong
The main reason for the failure of the strategy was the fact that the Member States did not stick to the rules and fulfil their obligations
Moreover , the Commission was not courageous enough , Mr Barroso
It was not courageous enough in connection with the implementation , in demanding reforms or in executing its own strategy
that you will promote technology and that we will not only talk about redistribution but that we will compete with the other economic regions of the world
These regions do not ask whether Europeans agree amongst themselves or whether they are implementing new redistribution programmes
They have their own dynamism , and we need to respond to this
That is the task that this strategy must allow us to fulfil
As yet , only drafts have been tabled and I hope that they will be improved upon , because these drafts seem very much to have a 'carry on as before' mentality
There are no really new approaches
There is not even anything really new from the Council and the new President of the European Council
However , we need this strategy in order to be able to keep up with the rest of the world
For this , new framework conditions need to be defined
We need to think carefully about the climate objectives of the past
We need to promote technology and not continue to put obstacles in its way
As a collegial body , the Commission is called on not to represent the interests of individual commissioners , but to take a leading role in Europe
You can be certain of our unreserved support
not deal with themselves
(FR) Madam President , President Barroso , Mr Van Rompuy , I would like first of all to say that , as far as the 2020 strategy is concerned , everyone agrees on the targets
growth globally
This therefore requires political awareness and , for me , that has two goals
Firstly , that of knowing how we organise ourselves politically
achieve them
This brings me on to the second goal , which I believe is essential , and , at the same time , it will be a question
To achieve goals in public policy , a budget is needed
Today , Europe is confronted with this dilemma: the Member States have significant deficits and the more significant their deficits , the less they will throw in Europe's common pot
Therefore , we are less able to revive our growth
How do we solve this dilemma
This is the question I put to you
It depends on two elements
Firstly , what are the guidelines that you will defend when discussing the budgetary perspectives with the Member States
and - why not
- to enable Europe to borrow to finance this necessity , which is the growth of tomorrow
(FR) Presidents , after the Lisbon Strategy , we now have the 2020 strategy
Is it a simple name change or a change of direction
I address this in particular to Mr Barroso
develop financial regulation , I said to myself , Mr Barroso , that it is a pity that you were not a proper President of the Commission over the last few years
Then you would have been able to do everything that you are proposing to us today
Today , you say that it is the crisis that prevented you from doing it , but it is easy to blame the crisis
In the end , every sin can be forgiven , so let us not waste any more time
not by the others
It is you we are counting on
the word 'community' means in terms of the general interest
misled by words
If words mean anything , we must , above all , think medium term , think global and think beyond nationalism
I agree with what Mr Lamberts said: right now , the Members of the Council are not giving us a great European perspective on financial supervision
They have both feet on the brakes
in all its forms , to consolidate disciplines and , of course , to consolidate solidarity
It is also to remind the Council that , while there are problems in Greece , they are partly down to the Greeks and partly down to a lack of solidarity
(DE) Madam President , it is easy to set fine goals
on whether we provide specific answers to the questions of who , what , how , how much and when
That is what we need to see for the Europe 2020 agenda
In my opinion , Mr Daul hit the nail on the head at the beginning of this debate
the euro , or without what we have spent decades building up
The alternative is that dramatic
Conservatives in Germany who have so often stood in the way of this
guidelines for common European economic governance
a common economic policy
strike in protest against precisely these measures , against precisely these results
the profits of the monopolies
measures
organised by the class-conscious trade unions in numerous countries of the European Union
union leaders , to the widespread attack by the government on wages and pensions: a development in their interests
the Member States of the European Union
junta , with ever greater powers over the Member States
Members of the Council were responsible for economic strategy within their governments and that they should be responsible for it at EU level too
Whether one calls it policy coordination or economic governance , only the Council is able to formulate and uphold a European strategy
and that that was why he had proposed that the Council meet each month
80% of the EU Member States' debt to become European Union debt
The campaign for an economic superstate launched in recent days is liable to turn not only Greece but all the 27 Member States of the European Union into protectorates
(DE) Madam President , the EU has now adopted a post-Lisbon Strategy in which it has been careful not to commit itself to any testable goals at all
Focusing on the green economy will not , in itself , be enough to guarantee the competitiveness of Europe as a centre of production
with cheap labour
back door
time for the EU to give new impetus to the existing merciless competition on the labour market
The European Union should not , as a general rule , employ despotism
It must not immediately withdraw financial aid from structurally weak regions because no reforms have been carried out - not even as a threat
We certainly do not need a new advisory committee to evaluate the goals , which will probably end up on the shelf once again
Instead of more centralism , we need to move the subsidies back to national level
Europe 2020 must not trigger another competition marathon and privatisation exodus
Instead , it must guarantee the prosperity of the citizens of Europe
The EU has a chance now to gain status as a bulwark against globalisation and this will probably be its only chance
European tradition and culture , and for that I admire and respect you
Precisely for that reason , may I take the liberty of commenting on your very rational speech by drawing an analogy from the world of football
to the game for a team which , after the rule changes introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon , may find it harder to score goals , that is , to achieve its objectives
score
What will happen if we do not follow this approach , which I wholeheartedly support
We will withdraw into a defensive position and we will score an own goal against the interests of our fellow citizens
opportunity
lead us
(ES) (Beginning of speech not available for technical reasons)
or to put it more harshly and crudely , the strategy of recognising the failure of Lisbon
environmental or social point of view
and the fiscal stimuli that should accompany the Monetary Union
From an energy point of view , a single European policy is still yet to be invented
that made us better when it made us Europeans , the very model that has succeeding in ensuring welfare and social cohesion
the Spanish Prime Minister , Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero
model that made us better when it made us Europeans
the greenhouse gas emission figure is not ambitious: it is pathetic , and it is not going to get us where we want to go
We should be looking at 40% by 2020
Of course , the issue is not only about climate but also about resource availability and increasing resource efficiency
than an indicator
It should not be the goal of a strategy
The EU has many areas where we have tried to decouple growth from transport , energy use , whatever , and it has long been decoupled from jobs
So , can we please not talk as if , somehow , growth is going to deliver jobs
do not undermine the ambitious goals that we might put in place
(DE) Mr van Rompuy , first of all , I would like to thank you for the letter that you sent us
I can tell you that I fully support the principles , values and the direction to take that you set out in the letter
Government and the Member States back to Europe
The Lisbon Strategy itself was not wrong , but the methods were wrong and the political will was lacking for the objectives to be implemented in the Member States
It must be your job to coordinate the Member States in areas where the powers of the European Commission and the Union are inadequate
You said very clearly that the market is not enough
Yes indeed , we want a social market economy
The monetary union is not enough
We need political union
The first test for all of us will be the 2011 budget , which will already have to be based on the Europe 2020 strategy
Europe 2020 is not the goal; it is the instrument with which we will do what we need to do in response to the financial and economic crisis
We need more coordination in budgetary policy , fiscal policy , economic policy , research policy and education policy , because we cannot improve our competitiveness with economic goals alone
We therefore need the Small Business Act to be implemented in the Member States
Our motto should be 'small businesses first' , because that will create jobs in the regions
There are three things I would like to see
Mr Barroso , we need a study of the effects of all of the Commission's measures on the real economy , not just on the banking sector
We need a review of our finances which also takes account of demographic changes and the social security and pension systems
We also need a joint package that includes coordination , the excessive deficit procedure , the exit strategy and Europe 2020 , so that these do not contradict each other
(ES) President Van Rompuy , President Barroso , I really like the sound of what I have heard today
must set ourselves objectives , and that we can choose our future
It would mean that there is no economic determinism , that there is a voice for politics , a voice for citizens , a voice for our future in our own hands
serving society rather than the other way around
learn from the past
fairness , the environment , the future or future generations
economic , social and environmental concerns compatible , because they are interdependent
and destroyed it
inclusive for all , and that we will finally make Europe's objective excellence rather than the fight to lower social standards
(DE) Madam President , Mr Barroso , Mr Van Rompuy , the crisis in the European economy is so deep that we have to expect very specific proposals in this situation -
specific proposals along the lines of those put forward here by various speakers
European economic governance has been called for in many different ways by Parliament
Provide a proposal for how the risks relating to the high levels of debt can be distributed so that Greece and other countries are not crushed by high interest rates
Provide a proposal - as called for by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs yesterday - for how we can tackle the imbalances
It is not only the countries with the deficits that need to be penalised and to make changes
Reforms also need to be made in the countries that have excessive surpluses
We need European statistics that are independent and we need to take effective measures to prevent tax competition
Such proposals have been put forward in Parliament
It is now up to you to finally put these things on the table
(FR) Mr Van Rompuy , Minister , Mr Barroso , ladies and gentlemen , finally , you are with us , President of the European Council , welcome
following 1 December , the date you officially took office
Like us , Mr Van Rompuy , you are a politician , and politics cannot exist without democracy
Europe , but they have the feeling that it is being built without them , and sometimes against them
citizens were once again placed at the heart of European integration with the Treaty of Lisbon , which created the high office that you hold
Member States and hence , the Heads of State or Government
Let us get to the point: the peoples of Europe are suffering because they no longer understand the huge global disruption going on around them
Your duty is to give meaning to it , to set the course , to convince the European Council that Europe is not a problem , but a solution
Europe does not expose , it protects
Europe does not suffer , it acts
What is your vision of the world and of the European Union's place in it
External Action Service
Mr Van Rompuy , the European Union walks on two legs
The Member States and governments and the peoples
We are looking for the head , and you are the head
Member States towards a political Union
Thank you for being here , Mr Van Rompuy
You are a man of great quality
Do not fear the peoples and their representatives
Love them and they will love you back
Strategy
action
Firstly , regulatory instruments and supervision of the financial system and of the banks are required to ensure that the negative conditions that are severely penalising us today are not repeated
Secondly , we will need to invest heavily in innovation , research and training , particularly if we want to move towards a green economy
For substantial investment to be possible , however , Europe must equip itself with Eurobonds and with a system of rewards and penalties so that it can achieve its economic objectives
Those are the main shortcomings of Lisbon I
We will have to introduce uniform redistributive policies with regard to both taxation and pay
Moreover , a coordinated industrial policy is required for sectors in order to protect the historic manufacturing structure of our region of the world
terms
common strategy in the next ten years and , in my view , this is extremely important
not we are making progress in that direction
I think this is fundamental , and it is a substantial change from the Lisbon Strategy
I am going to highlight one objective: the internal market
The European internal market was conceived more than 20 years ago
Twenty years later , there is a long way to go before we have a truly internal European market in the majority of sectors
will bring about growth , which , in turn , will bring about employment
Mr Van Rompuy , Mr Barroso , we need a great deal of political impetus: 'business as usual' can no longer be a tool
We need a great deal of leadership , and you have a big responsibility
You do , of course , have my full support for making this possible
(DE) Madam President , President of the European Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to briefly address two points
Firstly , do we already have a Europe 2020 strategy that promises success
No , as yet , we do not
I will tell you why
employment , then this is a miscalculation
If you do not believe us , read the statement issued by the International Monetary Fund yesterday
Private sector demand is a long way from recovery
We are concerned about public investment
If you do not pursue an integrated strategy with specific employment goals at the centre , we will have no chance of dealing with the crisis
Secondly , do we have an answer to the debt crisis in the countries that are under the most pressure
No , as yet we do not
More than one country has made mistakes
the speculators that , for five years , the Commission did not want to regulate - the hedge funds
Now we are finally doing that , but what does it actually mean in practice
We need a European monetary fund , a fund to help these countries
We need to be able to offer credit at sensible rates not only outside the euro area , but within it , too , with conditions attached
However , we need to establish a European policy to solve the crisis - and we need to do so now
European commitment and faith with which he took on his new duties
It is absolutely true that now is the time to determine how the Presidency of the European Council will operate
I am convinced that Europe , in the throes of a crisis , needs a strong hand and orientation at the helm
It is also a question of credibility for the new programme to avoid the fate of its predecessor , the Lisbon Strategy
I say this also as a member from a previously communist country
In that nook of Europe , there is - perhaps understandably - a natural aversion to bombastic long-term plans
I have one institutional and one substantive comment
Concerning the institution: we have to decide to whom this strategy is addressed
If it is addressed to EU leaders , then what has been done until now is adequate and the tight schedule is a good thing
and honestly involve the European Parliament and , what is more , national parliaments as well
Today's debate is no substitute for dealing with the topic in this House in the usual manner , with the rapporteur's statement , in the committees and the political groups
As for the substantive comment , the most important goal must be job creation
That must be the starting point for all new strategy
How to accomplish this
We know very little about that at this point
We know this much: fewer priorities , pinpointing bottlenecks , tighter economic policy coordination
That is all fine , but please , take into consideration the following: first , let us not throw out that which has been working well
of EU citizens
Secondly , the new strategy is to serve the interests of all regions , not only those of certain companies or countries
Through cohesion , the EU's competitiveness will grow as well
Thirdly , let us tailor the strategy to the countries
That is what will lend credibility to the whole thing
11 February was dominated by the so-called Greek question
to stabilise the euro and pointing out that Greece has not requested any financial support from the European Union
own efforts based on the measures which have already been announced
said that it will provide it promptly
reported in numerous articles in the foreign press recently
Greece is not asking for money
It is asking for something else
an expression of political support , solidarity and basic and honest trust
Support not just in words; support which has substance and content and will not be removed and undermined as soon as we are no longer behind closed doors
achieve results with the measures it has announced because , in the final analysis , that would undermine the efforts which the country is making
We must not bury our heads in the sand
We all know that , through Greece , speculators are targeting the euro area and the euro
So let us take all the measures needed to protect the euro area and the euro
(Applause)
that no reference whatsoever has been made to the agri-food sector in the 2020 strategy
in rural areas
Madam President , how can one conceive of a green and sustainable Europe without taking into account that 45% of all European territory is managed by farmers
How can one fail to take into account the nearly 30 million people who work on that territory
These are workers who must be safeguarded and protected
Before we focus on new jobs , we must protect the existing ones
are performed for the sake of the social and economic life of rural areas
The Spanish Presidency has also insisted strongly on the need for a powerful common agricultural policy
I am therefore concerned about this very serious omission , which I hope Parliament will be able to put right
(FI) Madam President , this is the year of the tiger , and China is an economic tiger
At the moment , India is a colossal building site , and I think that Indian development will have a huge impact on Europe
It is precisely for this reason that we need a new rhythm , the new beginning that EU 2020 symbolises
We need a common economic policy , an intelligent tax policy and the courage to acknowledge our structural weaknesses: research and product development
These issues have been very well presented here
I have two questions
How in future are we to monitor the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact on the basis of this Greek tragedy and the lesson it has taught us
Member States could not care less about it
(RO) Madam President , President in Office of the Council , I am pleased that you are here with us
I do not understand why the Council is attempting to make a decision in such haste , without any serious consultation with the European Parliament
We need the 2020 strategy as the Lisbon Strategy has not proved to be effective
However , the documents which are going round are general and fail to provide any clear statements referring to the future challenges
One example is the social aspect
The main social problems in Europe are the increased ageing of the population and the lack of high qualifications for workers
In these circumstances , allocating less than 2% of GDP to research , development and innovation is a first mistake which needs to be quickly rectified
the United States or Japan
(SK) I will try to be brief , in order to keep to the limit
I am disappointed that the President of the Commission is no longer sitting here , but I believe that the man responsible for interinstitutional cooperation is sitting here
competing against each other and for us to cooperate together in earnest on the instruments without which it will be impossible to achieve the objectives of strategy 2020
our common European economy which will turn us into a genuinely competitive region in a globalised world
question
I would like to ask him to reconsider his approach to the issue of parliamentary questions
Can I also apologise to President Van Rompuy for the disgraceful performance of Nigel Farage
I guarantee him that the great majority of British MEPs are going to treat him with great respect
(EL) Madam President , the eyes of the whole of Europe - and not just Europe - have been on Greece recently , as numerous speakers have already said
Against the backdrop of global economic crisis , it is not , of course , just Greece that has serious economic problems
There are other countries as well , as we all know
media
Be that as it may , you can all be certain that Greece is not bankrupt , Greece is not collapsing
Moreover , our country has never asked for financial support
What it has asked for and is asking for is political support
final analysis , that is what is at stake
(RO) At the start of the year , the unemployment rate reached 10% , while the deficit has grown in numerous Member States
Europe's citizens are waiting on immediate solutions to the current fundamental challenges: demographic changes and climate change , as well as the economic and financial crisis
The European Union must invest , as a priority , in creating and preserving jobs in education , health care , agriculture and transport and energy infrastructures
The European Union needs a sustainable energy strategy and a modern , safe and efficient transport infrastructure
2020
In addition , reducing polluting emissions means modernising industrial facilities across the European Union and not relocating European industry to third countries
guaranteed a decent living
Member of the Commission
obligations , but it is an honour for me to answer on behalf of President Barroso and on behalf of the Commission
strategy
Without your support , the EU 2020 cannot and will not succeed
I can assure you that the Commission will be very bold; the EU 2020 will put citizens , employment and reduction of poverty at its core and centre
definitely improve on governance
At the Commission , we are very much encouraged by the strong interest and what we hope will be strong support from the European Parliament
of five years ago when we were discussing the parameters of the Lisbon Strategy
But we need to do more; we need to get local and regional support for this strategy and , most importantly , we need to get the people behind it
Europe and in their countries and regions
I would like to ask you , honourable Members , to help us with this task
Let us not compete among the institutions , let us cooperate , let us focus on the priorities and let us deliver the concrete results
flexible initiatives which would be aimed at the bottlenecks , at the problems which are slowing the European economy , which are blocking it from using its full potential
We would like to focus more on education and training , so that the labour force in Europe will maintain the competitive edge which Europe deserves
We will keep the EU 2020 strategy linked to the stability and growth pact , because a solid fiscal position is key to the economic stability
needed to safeguard financial stability in the euro area
The Commission will closely work together with Greece and monitor how it implements the recommendations
additional measures
the European Central Bank and we stand ready to put in place a European framework for coordinating the action
necessary measures in place
I believe that we are ready to take bold action , be it on the EU 2020 strategy or on the situation in Greece
the process of the 2020 strategy , because the debate has only just begun
strategy for employment and economic growth , at the end of June
We therefore have a considerable amount of time in which to exchange views and determine the course of action once and for all
I therefore welcome this European ambition that I have found here this afternoon , and I welcome this sense of urgency that I have encountered this afternoon
There was one speech for which I have nothing but contempt , but I am not going to comment on that further
As far as the economic strategy is concerned , I will make a distinction between three periods
The first period is the period that we are still in now , in other words , the financial crisis and all its consequences
Allow me to use a different language from what I have heard this afternoon throughout the entire debate
I will explain
have happened recently
We have drawn consequences and learnt lessons from the crisis of the 1930s
We now find ourselves one year on from the major crisis and , in fact , in 2010 , we now have positive growth in most countries once more
That did not happen during the 1930s
The crisis actually lasted until the end of the decade
Why do we have this positive growth now
Because we have taken measures
We have taken measures to save the financial institutions , not because we particularly like them as such , but because , without them , there is no economy
We have conducted an intelligent monetary policy
We have injected liquidity into the economy , something that no one did 70 years ago
For at least 16 countries , we have created a zone of monetary stability , in spite of all the problems
In the 1930s , we had competitive devaluations
We have not had them today
We have conducted a risky budgetary policy using budgetary deficits to stimulate the economy
We did not do what was done in the 1930s , namely restore budgetary equilibrium as quickly as possible
Therefore , we have protected our internal market , which is not perfect
We must improve it , and Mr Monti will provide us with some concrete proposals
However , we have not lapsed back into the protectionism of the 1930s
Therefore , we have learnt some lessons from the major crisis that we have just experienced
I would even go a step further
It is thanks to the European Union that the G20 was born; we were the ones who took the initiative to create this embryonic world governance
along these lines
So Europe , the European Union , should not always be put on the defensive
There are also some very positive things that have been produced
Now we must leave this strategy , this so-called exit strategy , behind
pension system , our social security system and our health care system
require an immediate return to budgetary equilibrium
It requires a step-by-step approach , whereby we first reach a stage of 3% and then , in the medium term , budgetary equilibrium
I think that we have conducted and we are continuing to conduct a wise policy
the Lisbon agenda
There have , of course , been omissions; I am not going to list them here , they are well known
I will say this , however: we need some major reforms , or important reforms , and these important reforms , at European level and nationally , will demand budgetary choices
in its legal framework of the Stability and Growth Pact , to economic reforms
in the European Union's financial perspective
That means that some budgetary choices will need to be made
Another consequence of the choices we are making for the Lisbon Strategy is that the goals that we are proposing will not always be soft goals
It so happens that they could be hard goals
This is where it gets difficult
There is , on the one hand , the demand for reforms and , on the other , the implementation of the reforms
go back to their countries , I see few results of all that
We therefore need a consistent position
It is not just the European Union that will implement reforms
made , and therefore , it is a matter of demonstrating significant political will , and political commitment is the most important thing
It is often said that we need more binding measures
However , we should think about this
I have made quite a few proposals , which I believe are more intelligent than binding measures
However , even the Stability and Growth Pact , which contains many binding measures , has failed to put some countries back on track
Therefore , the method is not everything , the method does not resolve everything , and without political engagement , without commitment , the method is worthless
As for the economic strategy , it is all very well for some to say that we need more constraints
However , as far as economic guidelines are concerned , the Treaty of Lisbon does not make provision for that
the economic guidelines
Take a close look at Article 121 so that you are fully aware of this
Political commitment at both European and national level is therefore crucial , and without this political commitment , nothing will be done
One final word about Greece
I believe that we have sent out the right message
We have conveyed the message of the responsibility of the Greek Government , which must handle an extremely difficult situation , a situation that it inherited
It is taking some brave measures
take additional measures
and even of experts from the International Monetary Fund
I therefore believe that we really have framed and defined very clearly the aspect of responsibility
If necessary , there is , of course , an element of solidarity
Greece has said that it does not want to use that , but we have provided for two messages: a message of responsibility and a message of solidarity , if necessary
Naturally , we must draw conclusions from what has happened in Greece in recent years
In the euro area too , we must be more proactive with regard to both data collection and politics itself
This crisis was also a challenge , a challenge in the sense that we must practise the policy of coordination more
In fact , every crisis is a challenge
We must learn lessons from every crisis
Well , we will learn them
bonuses , a more far-reaching banking policy
However , we must also learn all the lessons from the experience of Greece and others
can cope with the difficulties that we face today
responsibility
Otherwise , we will not save our social model; otherwise , we will lose our position in the world
continue my work
(Applause)
Thank you very much , Mr President
It was indeed a great pleasure to have you here with us for your maiden appearance in plenary
In Greece , we have an expression for someone who assumes tough new duties
We say: œÉŒπŒ¥Œ∑œÅŒøŒ∫Œ≠œÜŒ±ŒªŒøœÇ , which means may you have an iron head in order to sustain everything that will fall on it during a difficult course
I think you have exhibited that; if you do not have it , you are developing it
Thank you so much for being here with us
The economic crisis has left a deep negative imprint on the EU countries' potential for economic growth
We have followed the debates on this topic and seen that attention has been focused on the measures for exiting the crisis and reviving economic growth financially
It is undoubtedly a good idea to tackle the problems in order of severity
However , it is important for us to realise that the situation is no longer the same as it was prior to the crisis
It is actually the economic model which needs to change
It must be based more on innovation and non-polluting energy sources , and focus on people's state of health
We cannot have a dynamic economy unless we have motivated workers
We cannot have a sustainable economy either if we support environmental protection only with half-measures
and personal motivation
Exiting from the crisis is basically not a problem about economic or fiscal policy
caused the economic and financial crisis
quality full employment , taking into account the needs of the labour market and ensuring social inclusion
affected by poverty during these hard times
I would also like to draw attention to education systems and the importance of acquiring new skills
Since the labour markets of the EU Member States are experiencing dynamic change , it is necessary to ensure that workers have the required skills for future labour markets
Therefore , it is imperative to invest in internal staff training and lifelong learning
We ought to pay most attention to one of society's most severe problems , growing youth unemployment
If young people are not given opportunities to enter the labour market , then there is a danger that Europe will lose a whole generation of young people
At the informal meeting of EU Heads of State or Government on the Europe 2020 strategy on 11 February , the very important matter of governance was raised
various Council sectors
in writing
- (PT) In this debate , those who hold responsibility within the European Union remain far removed from the real problems of citizens
and policies of the European Union are only serving to render employment more precarious and to aggravate unemployment and exploitation
this situation
increase in production
social resources , and promotes equality and women's rights
That means developing a budgetary policy which speeds up the allocation of Community support funds and transfers them more quickly and easily to the Member States
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure)
The EU 2020 strategy can only succeed if the Member States demonstrate sufficient commitment to carrying it out
all contribute to economic growth and job creation
the Lisbon Strategy
The 2020 strategy also sets out the next budgetary term's priorities without providing for detailed discussion at present
Consequently , one has to emphasise right now the importance of a common agricultural and cohesion policy for the next seven-year budget beginning in 2014
Without economic , social and territorial cohesion , there is no strong , competitive Europe
Convergence between the regions strengthens Europe's competitiveness
of social cohesion
The 2020 initiative , which constitutes one of the mainstays of the Spanish-Belgian-Hungarian Trio Presidency , has to respond to the long-term demographic and social challenges facing the continent
This means no less than a rethinking of the European labour market and educational system
participation of women and disadvantaged groups in the labour market
measures targeting undeclared work , the black economy and early school leavers , as well as improving self-employment conditions
ideas that have hitherto prevailed
ensure genuine improvement in each of the true measures of social exclusion reflected in the Laeken indicators
The current economic crisis is the most severe in recent decades , with its impact being reflected in the reduction by half of growth potential across the EU
This economic decline is also going hand in hand with an increase in the population ageing rate , which is hampering the efforts to help the EU economies recover
Against this backdrop , the 2020 strategy , which is intended to be a continuation of the Lisbon Strategy , must create the conditions required for sustainable growth and fiscal consolidation
In fact , lifelong learning must be much more accessible , with universities being much more open to accepting non-mainstream students
Better correlation between supply and demand and greater labour mobility will provide workers with more opportunities in places where there is greatest demand for their skills
Modern social security and pension systems are required in order to reduce poverty and exclusion
Employment policy must focus on labour market flexibility where employees assume responsibility for their working life through ongoing training , adapting to change and mobility
to people who are temporarily out of work
I share the sentiments of fellow Members who have raised the issue concerning the absence of agriculture from the EU 2020 strategy
heart of the European way of life
Last but not least , particular attention must be focused on agriculture because it has been hit extremely hard by the economic crisis
35% in some European Union Member States
in writing
- In line with the opening statement by President Van Rompuy , my intervention is devoted to the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty
While , in theory , the creation of the High Representative's double-hatted position looks good , in practice , given its 'uniqueness' , it creates problems unforeseen by the authors of the treaty
European Parliament , and flying to a foreign capital , where the EU needs equally high representation
Commission
And if the 'rotating Presidency' steps back in to restore the balance , we end up with more bureaucracy , rather than less bureaucracy
Europe 2020 must not repeat the failures of its predecessor , the Lisbon Strategy
The new strategy has been shaped , to a significant degree , by the economic crisis , the effects of which it is going to have to tackle
At the same time , we must make up for our neglect
Since the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact are so rigorous , how did the EU come to have a deficit of 7% and debt of 80% of GDP
Who is responsible for this
What we most want for the EU is a return to a path of rapid growth , and this is primarily what the strategy should help accomplish
performance of the health insurance system or the failing pension and benefits system
Furthermore , what about hours of work
Finally , what about the establishment of a system for the oversight and monitoring of banks and other financial institutions
Or how do we want to increase productivity
We need a new approach to these new challenges
The priority of the new Euro 2020 strategy is to be a more intelligent and ecological knowledge-based market economy
To achieve this objective , we should , above all , concentrate on strengthening the single market and increasing the free flow of services
The role of the European Community should be to promote entrepreneurship , and also to simplify the registration of businesses by lifting legal and economic barriers
Support , especially for small and medium-sized enterprises , is a significant matter
Lifting the requirement for micro-enterprises to submit annual financial statements and improving access to credit may be important steps in this direction
residents would like to become entrepreneurs in the next five years
I also think it is important to concentrate on creating economic growth based on knowledge , and on creating a competitive , cohesive and more environment-friendly economy
This is also why we have to pay attention to , and increase spending on , the development and preparation of young people to meet long-term challenges
be able to take advantage of competitive price offers in other Member States and SMEs will be able to operate in the European market unhindered
The EU 2020 strategy must stand on two pillars
On the one hand , solidarity among Member States which guarantees that no Member State will be left behind in the crisis
On the other hand , Member States also have to show solidarity with the community by faithfully carrying out jointly decided obligations
During the debate on the future of the EU , we should never lose sight of the already functioning policies
Common agricultural and coherence policies are the true results of European integration and symbols of solidarity between Member States and nations
a knowledge-based society , fostering innovation , strengthening social inclusion , creation of new jobs and a more resolute stand against climate change within the framework of sustainable development
The weakening of the previous common policies cannot be allowed to be the price paid for stronger cooperation in the above areas
oil did in the 20th century
social and health services
Therefore , there is a continued need for a strong cohesion policy based on solidarity
The EU 2020 strategy must mark a breakthrough
Otherwise , EU 2020 will be a Lisbon 2 , a strategy which will have to be replaced in 10 years' time by another new strategy
EU 2020 must clearly mark the start of the post-Lisbon phase
long term
There are three priority areas which must feature in EU 2020 without fail
The first one is active support for SMEs , based on the correlation of Community programmes with macro-economic policies
This approach will guarantee a healthy economic environment for private entities
The second is an education system which prepares the workforce based on the demands of the market
This process will ensure a better employment level in Member States
Finally , the European Parliament must have an increased role
This will allow real information from Member States to be used and prevent the disparities widening between Member States' economies
An EU 2020 strategy organised according to clear priorities will quickly revive economic growth in the EU , especially in the context of the current financial and economic pressures
- Mr President , I am delighted to have this opportunity to take part in a debate with you not only to report on the informal meeting of the Heads
of State or Government of two weeks ago - it was , after all , an informal meeting , with no formal conclusions to report - but also to take this opportunity to
Had I waited until the first formal opportunity to report on a European Council taking place at the end of March , I would not have come before this Parliament
By creating a full-time post dedicated to the running of the European Council and its follow-up , including external representation , the European Council now has a better chance to play
These three changes are all pragmatic improvements to the previous institutional architecture but , taken together with the fact that the European Council now becomes an institution in its own right ,
On the one hand , some consider the Presidency of the European Council to be a sort of pr√©sident in the manner of an executive Head of State , as in ,
On the other hand , the role is not merely one of being a chairman , giving the floor to one or another member of the European Council to speak during
The task of preparing and then following up its meetings , and representing the Union externally - for instance , along with the President of the Commission at the G20 Summit
That means a minimum of four times a year , though in most years , that is more likely to be five or six and may , in the future , rise to
I will continue to multiply other usual contacts with Members of Parliament , such as the meetings I have begun with leaders of groups and the monthly meeting I have
My task is , rather , to ensure that the Heads of State or Government can collectively agree on an overall strategy for the European Union , both as regards its internal
Public opinion and third countries may well find it difficult to grasp the difference between the President of the Commission and the President of the European Council; I am
The ordinary Council , which is the other branch of the legislature with the European Parliament , will still be chaired by a Presidency that continues to rotate every six months
Only in the configuration of foreign affairs where it coordinates executive power does it have a permanent president in the form of Catherine Ashton , Vice-President of the Commission and
At most , I can share with you my own personal conclusions from the discussions which I have set out in a letter to the members of the European Council
My aim with this informal Council was mainly to prepare our future deliberations on the issue of how to improve Europe's economic performance as we exit the immediate economic
This involves looking at our targets and ambitions - and we have a very useful paper from Commission President Barroso on this - but also how to improve our
How we go about managing our integrated European economy - the world's largest market - in order to improve our economic performance is one of the central questions facing
At the Solvay meeting , all members of the European Council agreed that we need better , more focused economic coordination in the Union , both for major economic policy - certainly
We also had a quick discussion on how to better implement Europe's actions in the reconstruction of Haiti; we want to take this discussion further with an eye to better
I took it upon myself to ensure that this was handled in the European Union's institutional framework and not outside it , and that the agreement reached met with the
I can assure you that I have one overriding goal for the coming years; to ensure that our Union is on track to be strong enough internally to maintain our
However , these gains have been wiped out by the financial crisis and its impact on many of our areas of activity: a 4% fall in GDP in a single
We need the Member States; we need the European institutions; we need stakeholders and society at large; and we need specifically the active involvement and support of this Parliament ,
With this , I mean a competitive economy , deepening the internal market , creating better conditions for investment - especially for SMEs - a European economy able to hold its own
There are still many issues: when I think about completing the single market , about the quality of our taxation systems , about the way we spend money at a time
We want a strong financial sector able to finance innovation and help businesses to grow: one which acknowledges its broader responsibilities to society and governments which came to its
It is quite evident at a time of globalisation , when we need to discuss with America , with China , with Russia , with others , that there is added value in a
common approach; for instance , in the G20 , an initiative that was in fact launched by the European Union during the French Presidency by the President of France and myself , when
The European approach is necessary , not to bring back powers in Brussels - this is not our intention at all - but to help the indispensable reforms in our
Let me tell you very frankly and very openly that I saw among Heads of State or Government much more awareness of the need to act together and also
We are going to present some of them: projects like an Innovation Plan , a new skills programme , a proper industrial policy , a digital agenda , green technologies , and a specific
plan or action against poverty; projects that have a value , an impact in themselves; projects that show why Europe provides part of the solution and which show that the European
Let me finish by calling upon you , the European Parliament , to show your strong support for these projects as legislator , as budgetary authority and as champion of European action in
Mr President , Mr Van Rompuy , Mr Barroso , ladies and gentlemen , the European Council of 11 February was the first to be convened and presided over by Mr Van Rompuy , whom
I welcome the positive and pragmatic spirit of your speeches since your nomination , and I appreciate the tone that you want to set in the European Council , but I
Now I would like to come to the substance of the debates of 11 February , which is , of course , the 2020 strategy , but it is also the euro and economic
I would like to put the following question: is the weakening of our common currency solely due to the Greek crisis , or is the euro the target of direct attacks
What is the situation , if not the fact that the Greek warning has shown the extent to which we must take courageous decisions to finally make sure that our
Of course , we talk a great deal , we talk about economic governance , we also talk about monetary governance , but we could make matters a great deal simpler and certainly more
The former French Prime Minister , Edouard Balladur , has himself recently recognised the need to abandon sovereignty in some areas - something that is not easy for a Frenchman -
This power would mean that they have a strong influence on the development of new global regulations , but it would also demand that the European forces unite within the
Let me cite a striking example - which was mentioned by Mr Barroso I believe - that of the IMF , where the voting rights are calculated according to the economic
However , if they presented a united front to the IMF , the euro area countries would represent 23% of the votes , and all the countries of the European Union , still
They would then be prepared for what they will soon have to do out of necessity , namely , truly unite instead of clinging to this facade of economic sovereignty , which
The good health of our economies and public finances , which we have striven so hard to put in order since the early 1990s , has been ruined in less than
Fears for the future trouble our societies , inequalities of all kinds have widened and some of our Member States are in desperate need of EU-wide solidarity and protection , having
That is a very important question , but can we afford to argue about the distant future without first providing an answer to those millions of Europeans who are now
feeling the impact of the crisis on their lives and who worry what will happen to their lives tomorrow - will they have a job; will they have the prospect
I need to answer their immediate worries and fears , and I want to be able to tell them that they will be able to keep their jobs , that new
There are other ways to pull Europe out of the crisis: putting people at the heart of our policy agenda and especially those who have been most hit by the
Europe should choose a morally decent way out of this crisis: a human way based on our fundamental values - which actually is also a smarter way in economic
Europe's growth potential would suffer even more than it already has and , as a result , the recovery would be extremely slow and a large share of the current unemployed
We believe this approach should involve an 'entry strategy' into the labour market , which should form an integral part of the 2020 strategy and constitute its roadmap for the
It should combine the macro-economic policy agenda with structural policies in the economic , social and environmental fields to aim at the creation of at least five million net new jobs
Proper economic policy coordination reaching well beyond the policing role of the stability pact should ensure that gradual fiscal consolidation in the different Member States is combined with the preservation
The March or June summit should give a mandate to its president , in close cooperation with the Commission , to submit an ambitious plan for the strengthening of economic governance in
This can only become a reality if the 2020 strategy is indeed about people and about jobs - in other words , if it incorporates an ambitious social and decent-jobs
In the name of my group , I urge you to do all you can to put people , and not least , the most vulnerable people , at the heart of the European
I therefore think it is the task of this Parliament to organise hearings with the relevant committee as quickly as possible , so that we can hear all the parties concerned
We cannot talk about remedies , about solutions , about reforms in the European Union if , first of all , we do not know what really happened in the case of Greece
Yesterday , I read the article by George Soros in the Financial Times on the matter , and a few days ago I read the article by Joschka Fischer in the
He is saying what many people are saying: the best solution to the Greek debt is a European solution - euro obligations , or a European monetary fund , without any
I think it is also the task of this Parliament to ask the Commission and the Council to reflect on that possibility and to go beyond the national interests
The Lisbon Strategy was too weak; the gap between the German economy and the Greek economy widened over the last 10 years: it became bigger , not smaller , after the
What we need - and it is the first decision to be taken by the Commission and the European Council - is to recognise that the open coordination method
Mr Barroso , I hope that in a few days' time , at the beginning of March - I think it is 3 March - you come forward with a paper on
What we ask from you is to take the lead on that , on this economic policy and on this economic governance , and to come forward , together with Olli Rehn ,
I think this is a time when we can expect something bold from the Commission , and I hope that on 3 March , the Commission will propose a document that is
Mr President , I would like to ask Mr Verhofstadt this question: are you advocating that countries which are not in the eurozone should bail out countries which are in the
- Maybe it will be necessary in the near future to bale out Britain , because I have seen that the fiscal deficit of Britain is even higher than the
So I think what is most important for the moment is that we have a credible strategy towards the eurozone , and I am very sure - maybe not tomorrow
I had intended to start my speech with the EU 2020 strategy , but now I am going to begin by talking about Greece , particularly in light of the intervention from
In my opinion , mistakes that have been made for a long time are now being revealed in Greece - often , more comes to light in a crisis than in
If we do not want anti-European developments , we need to discuss who in Brussels is responsible for allowing these things to be concealed in Greece for so many years
This , in particular , is something that you need to disclose , because as yet , we have only seen the tip of the iceberg in terms of responsibility and we have
If this help is necessary - which I think it will be - and if European solidarity needs to be employed once again - and I would not want
If I am to believe the Greeks with whom I have spoken , 25% of Greek workers are employed in the public sector , and it is not even a good
This will very quickly shed light on the fact that , in Greece too , the revenue can be considerably improved if tax evasion is ultimately prevented and the people in
For almost three centuries , the strongest economic powers in the world have also been those with the most liberal and the most democratic constitutions; the cause of freedom and
It is in the interests of our citizens that the 2020 programme succeeds in stimulating the creation of good jobs and rising living standards , and it is in the
Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank , which , in Germany , were rescued using billions of euros of taxpayers' money , are right at the forefront when it comes to the business of
Taxpayers' money is being used for speculation and this is money from normal , honest wage earners who do not have Swiss bank accounts like those to which the richer
We need harmonisation of tax types within the Union , but above all , we need genuine European regulation and control of the financial markets and a real European economic and
We were told that , when we had a President , we would see a giant global political figure: the man that would be the political leader for five hundred million
I sense , though , that you are competent and capable and dangerous , and I have no doubt that it is your intention to be the quiet assassin of European democracy and
You appear to have a loathing for the very concept of the existence of nation states; perhaps that is because you come from Belgium , which , of course , is pretty
Sir , you have no legitimacy in this job at all , and I can say with confidence that I can speak on behalf of the majority of the British people
What I said to Mr Farage two months ago I say , again , today: speeches of this kind , which make personal attacks on particular people , are not acceptable in the European
After the Irish people voted 'no' in a referendum , you said that , by supporting the 'no' vote , our group had opened the door to fascism; you said that we
In the current economic context , we could describe the country of Belgium as the Greece of the North Sea without any exaggeration whatsoever because this country , Belgium , has , after
Fundamentally , we are a sick country in Europe and , if I can put it this way , that is in no way a credit to one of the previous speakers ,
In particular , let us not claim that we will be able to avert the crisis by running up a higher government debt , the infamous Verhofstadt proposal for a European
On the contrary , we have seen , time and again , that it is European decisions that have led us into the crisis , European decisions to throw the Maastricht criteria and
The economic and geographical reality must now be pushed to one side and European citizens have to pay through the nose for the potential accession of a country which
Your comments at the beginning of the debate made it clear that you wish to set to work ambitiously , but also that you wish to perform your role as
Such a foundation means an exit strategy that will go hand in hand with a strong stability and growth pact and with the necessary reform of Member State governments'
Therefore , my question to you is: what specific objectives are you going to bring in to force the Member States , ultimately , to show real commitment to this new strategy ,
At the same time , a man like Mr Farage stands here in Parliament and lets fly with insults at a time when Europe is in crisis and we have
At least 50% of the funding set aside by the EU and the Member States to get us out of the crisis needs to be invested in a new
A first step would be to revise the controversial Posting of Workers Directive or , as it has come to be known in Europe , the 'Wage Dumping Directive' , which is
Just as openness and transparency are essential for the creation of a citizen's Europe , they are also key instruments in avoiding crises in public finances such as those currently hitting
(FR) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I agree with the idea of reducing the number of goals in the EU 2020 strategy to a limited number , provided that they are
Next , an ambitious goal concerning the reduction in inequalities: for example , reducing the level of poverty in Europe by 50% by 2020; that certainly would not be a maximum to
The first ingredient is strong market regulations and , from that point of view , Mr Van Rompuy , the developments with regard to financial market supervision and the positions adopted by the
Mr President , I support the direction of the EU 2020 strategy , particularly at this time of economic crisis , and would urge that the EU focus on Europe's existing comparative economic
I would seek for us to prioritise the completion of the single market for services and goods and to take an ambitious approach in creating a single market for innovative
There should be wide encouragement of research and development both in universities and in private enterprises in Europe so that we can be at the forefront of new sustainable
Anger has spilled on to the streets and the workers are indignant in the face of the harsh measures being taken by the Greek Government at the insistence of the
European Union , especially the recent European Council at which , instead of taking measures for the benefit of the weak economies , instead of taking measures to put an end to speculation
and create an umbrella of economic and social solidarity , instead of accepting that the Stability Pact does not exist and that bringing it back will deepen the recession and instead
While stressing the strengthening of energy security as one of the most important priorities of European energy policy and aiming to ensure the diversification of sources of energy and
In this strong Europe , we will probably have to dispense with the expression 'improving coordination' , as it means that everything is dependent on the subjects that have to be
With a broad majority , you have a new Commission for your second period of office - I hope that you will improve everything , that you will re-inject dynamism into Europe ,
Only then will the 2020 strategy succeed - not with the cowardliness of the governments and the insistence that someone pay for what the relevant partner in Europe does
However , the problem our continent has today is that it is emerging from a serious crisis , the characteristics of that being that we have extremely weak , or even negative ,
In the positions you hold , you have two major responsibilities: to encourage coordination of economic policies - this is absolutely vital - and to set targets with tools to
Secondly , are you able to move towards innovations that will allow the European Investment Bank and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development alike to assume much greater responsibility
While reading your contribution to the informal Council , while hearing you talk today quite rightly of the number of poor in the European Union and of the need to
I turn therefore with hope to Mr Van Rompuy , firstly to offer him a warmer welcome than the one he was offered previously by one of the other Members -
It is slightly paradoxical , Mr Van Rompuy , but we are counting on you to relaunch Europe , a proper European community , and you come from a country which knows what
If you tackle this , you will have the support of this Parliament , and I believe that , as far as the 2020 strategy is concerned , we must not let ourselves be
For my part , I therefore propose a single goal , which you actually mention in your own paper for the Council , and that is to have an Economic and Monetary Union
We all do this at the beginning of every year , we set fine goals , but whether they remain a dream , a sermon or whether they become an agenda depends
The question is , are we prepared to renounce national sovereignty in the area of economic policy , or would we rather do without the cohesion of the Union , or without
I would also have liked to have heard some clear statements from the representative of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) , because , as we know , it is the
Madam President , Mr Van Rompuy , Mr Barroso , I would like not only to hear the President of the European Council say , with quiet assurance , that the Council wants to lay
down guidelines in this area , but I would also like to see the Commission , together with Parliament , taking on the task of actively and with energy working to produce these
In so doing , it should not merely be led by the hand of Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy , but should make a sincere effort to bring Europe together under
(EL) Madam President , as you are well aware , while we are debating the results of the informal European Council , the entire Greek workforce , down to the last man , is on
They are protesting about the European Union itself and the policy of the centre-left and centre-right governments unanimously taking anti-grassroots , anti-labour measures purely and simply in order to safeguard
The European Union , governments and the Commission are trying to terrorise workers throughout the European Union in a bid to make them bow down before the storm of the anti-grassroots
However , in this war , the workers are responding with mass strikes , demonstrations and rallies , about which I have heard you say nothing , Mr Barroso , with demonstrations and strikes being
There is only one answer which the workers can give to the front being put up by the parties of capital , to the European one-way street , to the compromised trade
(IT) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , there has been a formal show of solidarity with Greece , but in reality , the aim was simply to impose a rigid austerity policy on
At the closing press conference , Mr Van Rompuy clearly stated that the idea is to establish a kind of dictatorship of the European Union , turning the Council into an imperial
Before the summit - the Independent revealed - he sent a letter to the Heads of State or Government in which he wrote , in one of the enclosures , that the
He also added that the European Council is very ambitious , that it wants control and wants to act as a leader , albeit , of course , within the scope of consultation ,
These are imperial designs of the architects of the European Union , and they also feature in a project that is circulating in the corridors of the Commission , which calls for
In my opinion , in addition to a well-functioning energy supply and infrastructure , this will require well-trained workers and not wave after wave of migrant workers flooding the labour market
If it is necessary to make the national labour markets more flexible , then it must not lead to the transitional periods for the new Member States being lifted by the
A time of crisis , in which more and more people are becoming unemployed or having to eke out a living from part-time work or 'one-euro jobs' , is not the
(IT) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , President of the Council , you may not be well known , as Mr Farage maintains , but I know that your ideals are deeply rooted in
The vision that you have of your role seems to me to be similar to that of a halfback , of a midfielder who has the job of bringing order
In the light of this example , I believe that it is up to Parliament to risk more than the other players , to be a striker who continually reinvents the game ,
taking inspiration from the new rules so as to strengthen the team's attacking ability and to put our hypothetical centre forward - the Barroso Commission - in a position to
Precisely for this reason , Mr Van Rompuy , I ask you to support the new leading role played by Parliament and to see it not as an obstacle , but as an
We are all required to rise to this historic occasion , to perform a historic role , a historic task , and I am certain that you are the right man to
If we are talking about the 2020 strategy , we are not only talking about the post-Lisbon strategy , but also about the strategy of recognising the failure to fulfil Lisbon ,
It is a strategy that was designed to ensure growth and sustainability , but it has not been fulfilled , because it has not succeeded in ensuring sustainability , from a financial ,
From a financial point of view , Europe has constructed the Monetary Union , but it is very far not only from constructing the Economic Union , but even from coordinating economic policy
From a social point of view , all over Europe , there is discontent among workers , unions and the most disadvantaged classes , who are concerned about the sustainability of the model
In view of the informal Council meeting that was held on 11 February , I would like to ask what commitment the Council , the Commission and all the European institutions want
to make in order to strengthen the commitment to the social pact that was mentioned in the speech by the rotating President of the Union for the next six months ,
A social pact that is able to clearly state that this time , Europe is going to make a commitment to financial and environmental sustainability , and also to preserving the social
Mr President , Mr Barroso talked earlier on about wanting an ambitious strategy , and it is true that there are parts of the document EU 2020 which are ambitious , but certainly
There is a lot , as well , that we seem to have seen before in this strategy , not least about economic growth coming through more and more as a goal rather
We also need to be looking not just at reducing poverty but reducing inequalities , because that has known demonstrable benefits , and we need to make sure that our financial institutions
I am pleased that you said today that you want to meet almost on a monthly basis , because it is your job to bring the Heads of State or
I hope that the lyrics will be the same next week , because as we have all understood - as have you - that would mean that we can and
It would mean the economy sets limits for us and provides us with the means , but that the objectives are set by us , and that the economy should be
It would mean that , as has been said here this afternoon , we need a long-term strategy , not just a short-term strategy , because I believe that is the lesson we can
The lesson we can learn from the past is that we have experienced considerable economic growth , but on the basis of speculation , which has not taken into account justice ,
I therefore really hope , President-in-Office of the Council , that next week , we will have documents that contain an ambitious agenda , an agenda that points to sustainability , an agenda that makes
I would now like to say a few words about the social dimension of the agenda: that is where the demands , dreams and fears of citizens are manifested , the dreams
and fears of those that are within and outside the labour market , of the victims of the arrogance of the financial markets , which has taken control of the real economy
That is where the hopes lie that we will put an end to this , that we will make a policy for full employment , for quality jobs , for jobs that are
However , I will begin by reiterating my great disappointment that your first political move was not to come and present yourself to the representatives of the peoples of Europe
The democratic lesson of the French and Dutch referendums of 2005 and of many other peoples , had they been consulted , is that citizens are saying they are not against
It is therefore thanks to Mrs Merkel , who was in your seat in 2007 , and to Mr Sarkozy , who had just been elected President of the Republic of France , that
Mr Van Rompuy , you must understand that nothing can be done without the citizens and their representatives , just as our Parliament must understand that nothing can be done without the
Could you tell us what part intergovernmentalism plays in your European strategy , in particular , with regard to the economic governance that we are lacking and the establishment of the
Moreover , you should not be in the passenger seat , but in the driving seat , and the future of the European Union will depend on your ability to steer the
(IT) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in defining the mid-term strategy , the Union will have to take account of the effects of the economic crisis , which is today penalising this
part of the world - and other parts too - and , of course , of the shortcomings that gave rise to the modest results of the previous strategy , the 2000 Lisbon
The crisis gives us some specific pointers with regard to development and full employment , if we want to incorporate - as I believe is necessary - this objective in our
Lastly , we need to reshape and relaunch social dialogue as a force for cohesion and for curbing the dangers of long-term unemployment with which we have to come to
(ES) Madam President , President Van Rompuy , President Barroso - who is not here , but whom I am also addressing - the truth is that it has been very good to
see you together and , in my opinion , this is because we have seen that there is a move towards and a focus on what should be the foundations of the
What most interested me about the proposal that we have seen in writing and what you have said is that there only need to be a few objectives: only the
top-priority objectives; that they need to be tangible , that we need to be able to measure them and they need to be constantly evaluated in order to see whether or
In some cases , this is because they are very new sectors , such as the digital market , but in other cases , there is such a degree of fragmentation and such
barriers that we are depriving the European economy of the large-scale framework that it needs in order to be able to really develop all the competitiveness that it needs , which
If , in the Commission and the Member States , you say that we will first carry out a rapid consolidation of the budgets and then deal with the economy and
However , if you read the data carefully and listen to the analysts , then you know that at least half of the Greek excesses are the fault of speculators -
(HU) Ladies and gentlemen , as a member of the Trio Presidency and as a Hungarian MEP , I follow with great appreciation the activity of President Van Rompuy for the strong
However , if we think it is addressed to the citizens of the EU , whom we want to win over to our side , whom we want to work with and
not against in shaping a stronger , more competitive Union that delivers more benefits to citizens than it does now , then we must proceed in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon
The EU has been strengthened by the existing community policies , and moreover , it goes against the founding treaties to discard cohesion and agricultural policies that serve well the interests
(EL) Madam President , this is a very interesting debate being held here today on the strategy for 2020 , but we all know full well that the informal European Council on
We also know that the informal summit culminated in a statement by the Heads of State or Government giving political support to Greece , expressing a readiness to take action
I should like to take this opportunity to remind the House that the Greek Government and the Greek Prime Minister have repeatedly emphasised that Greece is not asking for money ,
it is not asking for German or Austrian or Swedish or any other European taxpayer to pay its debts , which it will deal with , which it will limit through its
While we are on the subject , Mr Verhofstadt , it is not correct that Greece has said that it has provided all the information on the Goldman Sachs bond; it has
Moreover - I cannot see the President of the European Commission here; I should like to express my perplexity as to why explanations were only requested from the Greek
authorities and from Greece about a practice which was applied to saturation point by numerous Member States in the euro area over the ten years from 1998 to 2008 , as
Something which should be self-evident , not only by reason of its participation in the euro area , but also , more generally , by reason of its participation in the European Union:
Greece is asking for its partners not to do or say anything to fuel speculation and to stop sowing doubt as to whether or not Greece will be able to
(IT) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I must express my sincere regret , and that of the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , which I have the honour of chairing ,
It is absurd that the Commission's proposed strategy for the next 10 years does not include the central issue of the challenge relating to food security , growth and job retention
I would remind you that agriculture provides a whole host of essential services relating to , among other things , food , biodiversity , the landscape and the environment , and these are tasks that
My other question is this: what carrots and sticks are we to employ to enable the EU 2020 strategy to be more successful than the Lisbon tragedy , since the
Research and development could be based on public-private partnerships and on encouraging business people to invest in research laboratories and institutes in order to discourage the brain drain to
As an important step towards making strategy 2020 a success , I would therefore like to speak in particular about how essential it is for the various EU institutions to stop
It is , therefore , very important for national egoisms to be genuinely transformed into a sense of national responsibility and also a sense of responsibility at the European level , because unless
we address the issue of harmonising social policy and harmonising tax policy as soon as possible , it will not be possible to fulfil the objectives of economic policy or of
Madam President , I am most grateful to President Van Rompuy for describing his job spec , but I still do not quite understand why he is declining to answer my parliamentary
We are witnessing an unprecedented speculative attack which - I am sorry to say - has lately taken the form of slander of the worst form by some of the
What it has asked for and is asking for is real proof of solidarity from the other Member States within the framework of European Monetary Union because , in the
We must invest in energy efficiency measures for the benefit of both housing and modernising industrial facilities , thereby enabling us to create more than two million new jobs by
Last but not least , the ageing population and fall in the birth rate necessitate reform to the social systems so that every citizen in the European Union can be
- Mr President , honourable Members of the European Parliament , the session went a little bit over time and the President of the Commission had to leave because of other
I would like to start by thanking you all for a fascinating debate , for many interesting ideas , and for the enthusiasm and support you are showing for the EU 2020
I can also assure you that we have learned the lessons of the Lisbon Strategy and therefore we will focus on a lesser number of targets and we will
We are also very much encouraged by the sense of urgency in the European Council where it is very clear that the atmosphere today is very different from that
We must make sure that they will not see it as another administrative exercise but that they will see it as an approach on how to improve life in
In the EU 2020 strategy , we would like to introduce a three-interlocking-pillar system based on a smart , greener and inclusive economy and we would like to build upon these pillars
We talked much today about Greece and I would like to assure you that there was consensus that the euro area Member States would take determined and coordinated action if
A mission led by the Commission with the ECB and drawing on the IMF for technical support is now in Athens to assess the need for Greece to take
Let me be very clear; we have the tools to safeguard financial stability in the euro area if needed; this involves , in particular , the euro area Members , the Commission and
But each stage in this process must be allowed to take its course , and it is now for Greece to press on with the reforms and to put the
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am glad that we have had this debate; I am glad that I accepted your invitation to come here , at the very beginning of
We had a debate just recently , on 11 February , we will have a spring Council at the end of March , and we will finalise the 2020 strategy , or the
I would like to use a language that also reflects what is positive about the European Union , because surprising though it may seem , there are also positive things that
It is the first time that the big powers , new and old , have come together to combat the crisis , in an imperfect way , but we will continue to work
We have to find a balance between abandoning the budgetary stimuli too quickly and returning , in the medium term , to budgetary equilibrium , which is absolutely necessary to fund our
So it is a difficult balance that we have to find , and the Stability and Growth Pact provides us with the means to do it , because it does not
As far as the Lisbon Strategy is concerned , we know its handicaps , but we must not forget either that the financial and economic crisis has completely disrupted the implementation of
It is not by chance - and I have repeated this in the written conclusions that you have read - that we want to link the budgetary discussion , effectively
This is because , if we say that we need to do more research and development , for example , then we must make provision for that in the national budgets and
I do not say that I have heard it here , but outside this House , at European level , people are demanding hard measures , major reforms , hard reforms , and when people
We can encourage them , stimulate them and provide the right framework for them , but it is at national level that a large number of reforms will have to be
I myself did not draw up the Treaty of Lisbon , others did , but it does not provide for any sanctions , penalties , or negative measures as regards the implementation of
On 11 February , it told us that if the current measures are not enough to achieve a reduction in the deficit of 4% of GDP in 2010 , it would
We have made a commitment to carry out more monitoring , not only on the initiative of the European Commission , but also with the help of the European Central Bank
In the same way as we learnt lessons from the crisis of the 1930s , we must now also learn lessons from the financial crisis: more regulation , more monitoring of
Ladies and gentlemen , I believe that I have felt the same ambition in this House; I have felt the same political will to pursue an economic policy and strategy which
As many of you have said , this is not just the responsibility of one or two people; all the European institutions and all the Member States must assume collective
It is therefore in this frame of mind that I have come to meet you here this afternoon , and it is in this frame of mind that I will
I believe that in order to restore the potential for economic growth , we need to start with changing the economic model itself , which must focus on what generates innovation
Europe has already had a lesson , having been unable to implement the goals set out in the Lisbon Strategy and I hope that it will learn from the mistakes that
Therefore , in future , I call on you to pay greater attention firstly to the creation of jobs and to create not just any jobs , but try to ensure high
Secondly , it is very important to fight for gender equality and the abolition of poverty , especially with regard to people in the most vulnerable groups , as they are most
Although the European Council is very ambitious in this matter , I would nevertheless call on you to ensure even more active participation by the European Parliament , national parliaments and

(IT) Mr President , you have remembered the victims of the attacks in Russia
Only recently terrorist attacks also took place in Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan , countries which - like Russia - are outside the European Union
I think it is only right that we remember those victims too
You are right , Mr Speroni
I agree
With these introductory words , we in the European Parliament also refer to events of this kind which are happening throughout the world
We remember all victims with great pain
We also sympathise with the victims' families and friends , and with the countries where these things happen
However , this was an exceptional case , because such things have not happened in Russia itself for a long time
This is why I mentioned it
However , you are absolutely right , Mr Speroni
We should remember that every week , throughout the world , there are many very depressing cases of this kind

Mental health (short presentation)
The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mrs Tzampazi , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , on Mental Health
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , there is now an ever-increasing awareness that there is no health without mental health
individuals and their families and on society as a whole
The figures speak for themselves: one in four people will experience some form of mental disorder
Depression is one of the most common disorders and , by 2020 , will be the most common illness in the developed world
Some 59 000 suicides are committed in the European Union every year , 90% of which are attributable to mental disorder
Vulnerable and marginalised groups , such as disabled people , are more likely to suffer mental health problems
Also , in an ageing Europe , neurodegenerative disorders are becoming ever more common
We will therefore all agree that there is a need to take a concerted approach to the challenges posed by mental health and that it concerns us all
social support and protection to those who need it
Health and Wellbeing
treatment to people with mental health problems and to their families and carers
In the report , we stress the need to provide high-quality , accessible , effective and universal mental health services and up-to-date legislation
We call for emphasis to be placed on the training of everyone in key positions
We call for access to appropriate education , training and employment and for the creation of a supportive environment , with particular emphasis on vulnerable groups
We call for emphasis to be placed on the prevention of mental ill-health through social intervention
We call for the Member States to empower organisations which represent people with mental health problems
We propose the adoption of a platform to monitor the implementation of the Pact
We call on the Commission to present the conclusions of the thematic conferences
We stress the need to produce appropriate indicators with a view to improving the assessment of needs at national and European level
At the same time , we are formulating proposals within the framework of the five priority areas of the Pact

Member of the Commission
- Mr President , I congratulate the European Parliament and its rapporteur , Ms Tzampazi , on this own-initiative report on mental health
The report quite rightly underlines the great impact mental health has on general wellbeing , on education , on learning , and on social cohesion in the European Union
in this field
In my view , there is some reason for optimism
There is more awareness of the importance of mental health and wellbeing across all sectors , compared to a few years ago
which were mentioned by the rapporteur
Further positive developments include the fact that many Member States have revised their mental health strategies or are setting up action plans , for example , in Finland and Hungary
Socio-economic learning has been included in school curricula
In the United Kingdom , life issues are now a subject in their own right in many schools
Employers are increasingly aware of the links between wellbeing and productivity
CSR Europe has even created a toolkit for wellbeing in the workplace
However , let us be clear
There can certainly be no reason for complacency , and much more remains to be done
There could be new risks for mental health as a result of the current financial and economic crisis
asylums
The economic downturn worsens the future prospects of young people , especially school leavers
Job insecurity in the workplace , and its ensuing concerns over the stability of incomes and rising levels of unemployment , create new major threats for mental health
Over the next two years , the Commission will organise a series of thematic conferences on the five priorities of the mental health pact
These will be joint events with Council Presidencies and Member States
A first international conference on stigma and psychiatric care will be organised by the Czech Presidency on 29 May this year
The first thematic conference on mental health in youth and education will take place in Stockholm on 29-30 September , in cooperation with the Swedish Presidency
The second thematic conference on the prevention of depression and suicide will be organised with Hungary in December
In the first semester of 2010 , the Spanish Presidency will host a thematic conference on the mental health of older people
Furthermore , we are in contact with Member States regarding two further conferences on mental health in workplace settings and on combating stigma and social exclusion
Parliament's report includes many concrete suggestions which constitute a valuable contribution to future debates in these conferences
health at European Union level
One of the suggestions in the report is to set up a structure to oversee the implementation of the European Pact for Mental Health and Wellbeing
I agree that there would be significant added value in periodically reviewing progress against the objectives of the pact
We will seriously consider how we can best put such an idea into practice
Once again , I would like to thank Parliament and its rapporteur for this very supportive report and its very important recommendations
The item is closed
The vote will take place on Thursday , 19 February 2009

The differences in standards that apply to prevention and the guarantee of first-rate care are too great , both among the EU countries and regionally within countries

We should not forget , however , that the most important preventive mental health work is always the responsibility of educators and agencies outside the family and home
This entails promoting healthy lifestyles , and listening to children and young people and paying attention to them
top quality research
There should be more funding in particular for medical research into the links between prevention and mental and physical health problems
Mental health disorders are national health problems in many countries , as they have a significant influence on the people involved , their families and society in general
Mental health disorders also often lead to disability and can thus cause a significant economic burden on society
In accordance with the World Bank's 1993 development report , four of the ten most common causes of disability were mental health and/or neurological disorders

Such a situation is often caused by the prevalent partly negative public and political attitude in society and the stigmatisation of the mentally ill
This , in turn , leads to insufficient attention being devoted to mental health , limited availability of services , the shortage of alternative treatment methods and insufficient information about treatment possibilities

As we know , mental health is a fundamental value for every person , and we , the representatives of the nations of Europe , must not forget this fact
I think it is a good thing that , today , we have turned to this issue in the forum of the European Parliament
Mental illnesses , a flood of suicides and depression have become a threat to contemporary society
These problems do not only affect people who live under constant stress , but also children , young people and the elderly
I think that we should take far-reaching steps to defeat these diseases of civilisation
This is also why I support research and free access to the results of this research , as well as specialists

Such people very often display antipathy towards others , feel alienated , and have a fear of the censure of society

Mental health and wellbeing are a major challenge during this century we are living in

and Eastern Europe
are confidential and which will not stigmatise these children , in order to meet their social and emotional needs
Bearing in mind that mental health determines the quality of life of the European Union's citizens , this issue must be dealt with just as seriously as physical health matters
In fact , a European action plan for this is required in order to respond to the challenges posed by mental disorders
When we talk about health , we are usually referring to physical wellbeing
Yet mental illness can be as much of a handicap to the daily lives of sufferers , and has extensive adverse social effects
Parliament's initiative to improve information on mental health is a very positive step , therefore
There should be more public discussion of approaches to mental disorders and , in addition , methods for preventing mental illness should be made accessible to the general public
The workplace setting should be particularly emphasised in this connection
health in that particular setting
Only motivated , balanced workers are in a position to meet the demands made of them
Awareness of this issue should therefore be raised among businesses and public bodies
On the whole , by recognising mental disorders , Parliament is indicating a modern understanding of health and offering many sufferers a positive perspective in the long term
We realise that mental health problems frequently have an impact , from a humanitarian and financial point of view , both on the personal , family , professional and social lives of the
We all have an obligation to defend mental health and safeguarding the rights of mental patients and their families is an ideological and political position whereby the state provides

In keeping with this , the report on mental health , which was approved unanimously by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , includes a series of recommendations to
promote the mental health and wellbeing of the populace , to combat the stigma of discrimination and social exclusion , to strengthen preventive action and self-help , and to provide support and adequate
Within this framework , we stress that , in order to prevent depression and suicide , we need to implement multi-sectoral programmes and set up networks , to develop a healthy climate in
schools , to improve working conditions , to adopt measures to improve the quality of life and , finally , as regards combating stigma and social exclusion , we stress that public information and awareness
For this , I should like to thank the members who contributed with their proposals and I hope that we shall send out a message that mental health is a
The fact that Parliament is adopting this report only two years after a resolution responding to the Commission's Green Paper on mental health signals the urgent need for more action
This was evident from the great support for the Commission's high-level conference 'Together for mental health and wellbeing' and the European Pact for Mental Health and Wellbeing , both of
Member States could be tempted to reduce budgets for mental health or to reduce their efforts to build up modern mental health systems with community-based services instead of outdated
The report not only highlights the relevance of mental health in the European Union , but also demonstrates that there are many opportunities to act in the area of mental
I support this report since it entails a comprehensive approach to the challenges we face in the mental health sector , such as combating stigma , discrimination and social exclusion , but
As a relatively new science , mental health is not widely recognised as a priority , but recent technological developments have allowed us to explore more of the human brain , showing the

Mental health is also very relevant in workplace settings where it can severely hamper performance , so we need to promote good practices among employers that reduce unnecessary stress and
Not only does mental ill-health entail an expense that is a burden on the healthcare sector and the entire social and economic system; it also detracts from the quality
Although there have been dramatic leaps forward as regards standards of care and general attitude , people who suffer from mental health problems and their families are being marginalised more and

The employees of the new Member States are discriminated against in many areas
The first area is the amendment of the Staff Regulation , the legislation on public servants
The second includes the fact that new categories have been created , and the lower categories are applied to the delegates of the new Member States
The third area of discrimination is that all the secretarial staff from the new Member States have been employed in the lowest category
The fourth area of discrimination is that the employees of the old Member States were suddenly elevated to a higher category before May 2004
There is discrimination also in the area of benefits as well as in the area of examinations in people‚Äôs mother tongue

Mr President , in the last Parliament MEPs voted overwhelmingly in support of the EU appointing an Aids ambassador/envoy
The EU continues to do much to combat the rise of Aids and to provide information on preventive health programmes and support for access to anti-viral treatment for all
However , EU programmes need tighter coordination to ensure that EU Aids initiatives are producing optimal results
I believe the appointment of an EU Aids ambassador would enhance the international effort to combat the spread of this tragic disease
The total number of Aids sufferers worldwide has now reached 40 million and continues to rise
forward with this proposal and add impetus to the effort to put Aids on the top of the EU development agenda
citizens of Poland and of the other new EU Member States for the past few months , namely the suspension of food exports to Russia

None of the obstacles mentioned can justify Parliament‚Äôs seat remaining in Strasbourg when all of its business is conducted in Brussels
In fact , there are no substantial or rational reasons to do so
Plenary sittings in Strasbourg are simply an extravagance , a luxury that costs millions of euro a year to organise
There can be no doubt that this money could be put to a more sensible use , for example by providing more funding to the European Union‚Äôs poorest regions

in order to recover the victims of
In principle , President Wade responded favourably to this here in this House a year ago
On various occasions in this House , we have also asked the Commission to take action
I would therefore make a fresh appeal to the Commission , the Council and President Wade of Senegal
The relatives of the victims are entitled to take leave of their loved ones in a dignified manner
They are asking for a final resting place where they can grieve , and alongside this , they are also enquiring about the possibility of identifying the victims
Mr President , I am directly appealing to your respect for the values mentioned in the European Constitution
Respect for human dignity requires support from the European Union
The Romani population is the largest minority in the EU
The Roma face serious human rights discrimination: segregation in schools and in the labour market
Sadly , in some parts of the European Union very serious human rights abuses against the Roma have been reported in recent years
The Roma have increasingly come to be a focus of attention of European policy- and law-makers following reports of social exclusion and serious human rights abuses throughout Europe
It is time to continue in the steps of the few who already recognise , here in the European Parliament , the crisis of the Romani population
Today , we need to combat discrimination by reaching cross-party agreements for the sake of a better Europe

Mr President , there is an issue I should like to bring to the attention of the House
Nearly six months have passed since the enlargement of the European Union to include ten new Member States
Since then , the new Member States and the old Member States are supposed to constitute a single common structure
Integration is supposed to be apparent in many key areas , yet we are experiencing marked delays in the full integration of the new Member States
new Member States , and so that their full integration with the other Member States can be accelerated
This applies primarily to transitional periods relating to the free movement of persons and the free movement of services
These two areas are crucial for genuine European integration and for developing the entrepreneurship necessary for the development of national economies
the old Member States
are not experiencing
The problem of asylum seekers and illegal immigration in Europe is urgent , serious and worrying
not proportionate to its size and population
Therefore I believe that one of the solutions is that the burden should be shared
This is a matter that transcends frontiers and therefore it should have an international solution , possibly through a common effort by the United Nations and the European Union
We cannot remain idle and postpone this issue
Do you not think , Mr
asylum seekers and the countries involved
Mr President , it was just announced that tomorrow we will vote urgently on financial aid for Serbia and Montenegro
However , a week ago there was an extraordinary book launch in Belgrade
It was by Radovan Karadzic , formerly President of the Bosnian Serbs

Mr Karadzic's book is called
Mr Karadzic was not present at the launch
itself a miraculous chronicle of the night
It does not inspire confidence that these forces are doing enough to harass him and his network of loyal supporters so that he can be brought to justice
I hope Parliament can send a message that Nato and the Bosnian Serb police need to try a little harder
Mr President , very recently , two MEPs from the Netherlands , my own country , were refused entry to Cuba
They were deported from that country when they were travelling to talk to human rights activists , so-called dissidents
This is characteristic of what is happening in Cuba , because it fits in with a systematic pattern
Dissidents , including trade union leaders who , a few years ago , were able to talk to us , are now often sentenced to long prison sentences
Things are going from bad to worse , and contact with politicians such as ourselves is also affected
even manage to get a meeting
I am saying this because some people here are urging in favour of a with Fidel Castro
My response to that would be that it is serious incidents of this kind that should lead us to persist in the common policy as it stands at present
I have received 22 requests
We are clearly not going to be able to satisfy all of them , otherwise we would far exceed the half an hour set aside for these purposes
honourable Members
Mr President , I should like to remind you that , this weekend , presidential and legislative elections took place in Tunisia

it being clear to everyone that this arrest is linked to Leyla Zana‚Äôs appearance in the European Parliament
So far , I have not received a response to this
You will be aware that , last Friday , legal proceedings were commenced against Leyla Zana , this being the third time she has faced them
in my view , this is very important in the context of the continuing discussion about accession negotiations with Turkey
Mr President , I should like to express my concern about the defence of EU working languages
COSAC meetings to just six
I am aware that in this House , too , there have been times when , for reasons of cost-cutting , some Members have had difficulty in using their languages as working languages
In the proposal tabled by the Dutch Presidency , only six working languages are safeguarded ‚Äì those of the six biggest countries
Of course , Portuguese is the language of a country that is not one of the biggest and is therefore in jeopardy
The question before us , Mr President ,
Mr President , in 1993 , the European Parliament adopted a resolution commemorating the victims of National Socialism
Last year , ten years after that event , an exhibition was also mounted on the subject in this House
and that the historical research available on the subject is factual
the future
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today , 25 October , is the day we in the Basque Country are celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Guernica Statute
legal and political framework stemming from the Spanish Constitution , and it has given us Basques the greatest degree of self-government there has ever been in that region
I can assure you that the Guernica Statute is the best framework for creating trust , well-being , development and freedom in the Basque Country
for the next generation of Basques
Parliament to send our congratulations to the Presidency of the Basque Parliament on the occasion of this anniversary
stocks exceed even last year's record highs
Yet the headline story fed to the media , in advance of that advice , referred only to cod stocks and the lack of improvement therein in the North Sea
This has echoes of last year's situation when , after the publication of scientific advice , there followed threats to close the entire North Sea to all fishing
Ultimately , at the December Council last year , the Commission tabled a quota recovery plan which quickly proved to be unworkable
It did nothing to safeguard cod and it prevented Scots fishermen from catching their allowed haddock quota
Sea Regional Advisory Council in the setting of quotas in advance of this December's Council , so that a sensible and workable plan on quota setting procedure can take place
That concludes the speeches on matters of political importance
Report of the European Central Bank (2004/2144(INI))
innovative nature of the ECB‚Äôs report for 2003 , presented under Mr Trichet‚Äôs guidance
A period such as 2003 can be analysed from two perspectives: what exactly happened in 2003 and what was decided in 2003
These are two distinct notions , because , according to econometrics , monetary decisions have a delayed reaction on actual developments of something in the region of 12 to 18 months
What we are therefore discussing here today is , in some respects , the policy of 2002 and its orientations in 2003
rises
Unfortunately , 2003 also saw a major slowdown in the EU in relation to its major competitors ‚Äì the United States , Japan and China , among others
It is therefore with this information in mind that we must analyse the orientations given in 2003 by the ECB , which were both practical and doctrinal
cut their interest rates sharply , the ECB retained the same interest rate virtually until December
the positive effects of this in 2004
this orientation and the way in which it was justified in the 2003 report
interest rates might be taken to a negative level
Secondly , we are told that the M3 money supply is important in the long term , yet not in setting monetary policy
I feel that both of these theories are perfectly justified
Our report welcomes this major orientation , and we shall table the amendments again to welcome it even more clearly
to the general public and that this accountability entails dialogue with Parliament
this ECB report represents a major step forward
I feel that the next step is to develop this dialogue further , and in our report we make proposals to this end
Thirdly , in our proposals for the future , we are naturally thinking about the new countries‚Äô accession
countries
This is not an issue of two weights and measures; the same rules apply to 2005 , 2006 and 2007 as applied in 1997
Lastly , we must start to consider the new generation of bank notes
We feel that we must keep the one and two cent coins and many of us feel that we should introduce a 1-euro note
It is essential , in our view , that bank notes and coins should bring the general public closer to its currency
It is time to put living people on our notes , as every country in the world does
just now
I am delighted to pursue this dialogue , from the ECB‚Äôs side , in this spirit of frankness and cooperation
present monetary policy , and the activities that fall within its competence , to Europe‚Äôs citizens and to you , the representatives of Europe‚Äôs citizens
The ECB attaches the highest importance to regular dialogue with the European public and with its elected representatives
Mr President , the ECB's monetary policy operated in a rather uncertain and challenging environment in 2003
In the first half of the year , real GDP growth stagnated amid considerable uncertainty related to geopolitical tensions and turbulence in oil prices and financial markets
Following the easing of economic and geopolitical uncertainties , prospects for economic activity gradually brightened after the summer of 2003
Nevertheless , overall GDP in the euro area increased by only 0
5% in 2003
Annual HICP inflation slowed down slightly in 2003 to 2
1% on average from 2
3% on average in both 2001 and 2002
of 2003 , food prices
Rises in indirect taxes and administrative prices also added to inflation in 2003
HICP
This expectation resulting from our economic analysis was in line with our monetary analysis
shifts into safer , short-term liquid assets included in M3
25 basis points in March 2003 and by 50 basis points in June of the same year
Thus , in June 2003 , the interest rate on the main refinancing operations reached 2%
contributed very significantly to the low level of medium and long-term nominal and real interest rates
The resulting yield curve has delivered a financial environment very significantly supportive to economic recovery
The economic recovery , which started in the second half of 2003 , has continued this year
In terms of year-on-year growth rates , we reached 2% in the second quarter of this year
By and large , output growth in the last 12 months was close to present estimates of potential growth in the euro area
We expect a continuation of this growth trend in the coming quarters
On the external side , the world economy is currently recording its strongest growth for 30 years
Some moderation is expected next year , but euro area exports should , nevertheless , continue to benefit from favourable global demand conditions in 2005
On the domestic side , investment should normally benefit from the positive global environment , the very favourable financing conditions in the euro area and the improvements in corporate efficiency
There is scope in the euro area as a whole for a strengthening of private consumption , but naturally some uncertainty as to outlook exists
One of the risks stems from developments in oil markets
fact that the oil intensity of the euro area is significantly lower than in the 1970s
second oil shocks , but it remains true that the oil price increase constitutes an adverse supply shock for the euro area economy as a whole
For the oil price shock to be absorbed smoothly , the policy mistakes of the past must not be repeated and , in particular , 'second-round' effects must be avoided
As regards consumer prices , oil-market developments have had a direct impact on the euro area HICP
Following an annual rate of 1
7% in the first quarter of 2004 , inflation reached 2
3% in the second quarter and 2
2% in the third quarter
Inflation rates over the past year have also been driven up by exceptionally strong rises in indirect taxes and administered prices all over the euro area
Nevertheless , looking ahead , the available information does not indicate -‚Äì in our eyes ‚Äì that stronger underlying inflationary pressures are building up domestically as yet
Wage developments have remained moderate since the last quarter of 2003 , and this trend should continue
Provided that there are no further significant shocks to prices , annual inflation rates should drop below 2% in the course of 2005
However , I should stress that , over recent quarters , we have seen several upward risks to the outlook for price stability emerge , and these call for ongoing vigilance
This again relates to oil price developments and possible second-round effects stemming from wage- and price-setting behaviour
Other concerns relate to long-term inflation expectations and also monetary trends
Indeed , the downward trend in annual entry growth since mid-2003 appears to have halted over the summer of this year and the shorter-term dynamics of entry have strengthened
This reflects in part the fact that the historically low level of interest rates in the euro area continues to support monetary expansion
The low level of interest rates is also fuelling the growth of credit to the private sector , and we have witnessed continued strong growth in loans for house purchase
Given the strength of M3 growth over the past few years , there is presently substantially more liquidity in the euro area than is needed to finance non-inflationary growth
I now turn to other aspects we are looking at
A good and credible monetary policy is certainly a necessary condition for sustainable growth and job creation , but not a sufficient condition by itself
Other conditions must be met , in particular sound fiscal policies and appropriate structural reforms
In this respect , in the area of fiscal policy , last year proved disappointing
The average fiscal deficit in the euro area increased from 2
4% to 2
7%
Moreover , the fiscal situation remained of great concern in countries that had already recorded significant imbalances in 2002
The aggregate euro area fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio is not expected to improve in 2004 and the average debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to deteriorate further
This is certainly a source of concern
Last year fiscal policies in the EMU faced a number of serious challenges
concerned in abeyance
On the very same day , the Governing Council of the ECB supported the view of the Commission
The Stability and Growth Pact is the cornerstone of EMU
It is key to providing an economic to a single currency area which has no federal government and to ensuring macro-economic stability on a sustainable basis
The Governing Council of the ECB is of the opinion that substantial improvements in the Pact's implementation are needed , particularly as regards the preventive arm of the Pact
and we insist on the importance of preserving the full integrity of the nominal anchor of 3% in the corrective arm of the Pact
to political interference and electoral cycles
On that particular point we are in full agreement with Ecofin
On a more positive note , both 2003 and 2004 have seen some progress towards structural reforms in several euro area countries
While implementing these reforms has not always been easy , I am confident that we will be able to see their positive effects in the years ahead
I have said clearly that the ECB is backing governments , parliaments and social partners that have embarked on those necessary reforms in the euro area
We cannot be complacent
In many areas further reforms are needed
The continuing reform process is key to enhancing the euro area's production potential and ensuring future growth and employment opportunities
The year 2003 was also marked by the final preparations for the enlargement of the European Union by 10 new Member States , with effect from 1 May 2004
As far as the ECB is concerned , the integration of the central banks of the 10 new Member States proceeded smoothly
Important challenges remain for these countries on the road to adopting the euro
Last week , the ECB , like the Commission , published the first Convergence Report dealing with these countries , together with Sweden
The report identifies several priority areas in which individual countries will be required to make further efforts before they can adopt the euro
The picture that emerged varied significantly from country to country , but many share similar challenges with regard to price stability , fiscal sustainability , exchange rate stability and interest rate convergence
In addition , institutional convergence has not yet been achieved in all countries , in particular in the area of central bank independence
I cannot over-emphasise the latter's importance for the successful conduct of monetary policy
The ECB very much appreciated the favourable comments contained in the European Parliament's draft resolution on the ECB's monetary policy strategy in 2003
We have always strived to demonstrate a strong commitment to achieving our primary objective of price stability
Inflation has remained subdued , despite a sequence of adverse disturbances
price stability and for consolidating an exceptionally favourable yield curve , because , on a medium to long-term basis , these inflationary expectations are incorporated in the market rates
I have noted that on the most important issues the views expressed in the draft resolution are very similar to those held by the ECB
Nevertheless , there are a number of issues where we have slight differences of views
not be made public
whole
Such public discussions would have adverse consequences for the credibility and the effectiveness of the ECB's monetary policy
after Governing Council meetings
explaining monetary policy decisions immediately after they are taken
the Governing Council
The ECB is the only major central bank which makes possible immediate interaction with the media
These features make the ECB , in our view , one of the most transparent central banks in the world
as regards developing joint rules and standards in the field of clearing and settlement , which is also mentioned in the draft resolution
These standards represent a highly significant contribution towards a securities infrastructure that is safe and integrated
furthermore , a source of financial instability
and regulations in force , we do not wish , under any circumstances , to prejudge any decisions that may be taken in future
to ensure that they remained in line with the provisions of the directive if , once again , such a decision were taken
with more details and greater transparency , including on the critical aspects of current policy
with the whole thing
Mr Lipietz‚Äôs original report contains some criticisms of the ECB , and with these we do not agree
Let me begin with interest rate policy , one general criticism of which we regard as misplaced
keel; the economy is growing , the euro is stable , and interest rates are low in real terms
stability and moderate rates of inflation
responsible for full employment or economic growth; to do so would be to lay far too great a burden on it
These matters are for the national governments to deal with
Mr Trichet pointed out that this is where Budget policy is important , and the national governments have failed to discharge their responsibilities in this respect
We cannot correct that by overburdening the ECB
We also share the view , expressed by Mr Trichet , that the votes of individual members of the Governing Council should not be published
To do so would politicise the ECB , and would do Europe‚Äôs present economic development no good
subject again
the due time , of summary minutes without individual votes; the matter should then be left there
To sum up , we should allow the ECB the freedom to act in the manner laid down in the Maastricht Treaty on European Union
why the rapporteur has not dissociated himself from it
We regard the report , as it stands , as balanced and good , and in this form we endorse it
We do not believe that it needs to be amended
‚Äì A debate such as the one we are having today is very important as it affects millions of people throughout the whole continent
At times , I find it amusing that , in this House , we seem to make the mistake of thinking that the entire debate is exclusively for us economists or bankers
and to whom we are responsible , who do not even know what we are talking about
As I said , the matters that we are discussing today and that are the subject of the Central Bank report affect the daily life of millions of people
Mr President , I come from a very small village , with a total of 800 inhabitants , in the smallest Member State of the European Union , namely Malta
Nevertheless , what we are debating with such pompous words sometimes affects the lives of families as much as it affects multinationals , which have very powerful lobbyists here and in Brussels
These normal families , or ordinary people as they are referred to in English , pay taxes and abide by the law
It is to them that we owe our first allegiance in all the decisions we take
I believe that , in the future , the main task of new Member States of the European Union must be to put their economies on strong foundations
They must do this whilst being careful not to rip the social fabric which in many countries , including mine , has taken many years to weave
It is in these terms that the issue of when to adopt the euro must be considered
social achievements of recent years
Things should not be done in a hurry , but planned wisely
Our first priority should be our need to be more competitive both as individual countries and as a continent
have already adopted the single currency
This was a positive experience for many countries
Nevertheless , there were complaints about unwarranted price increases implemented as soon as the system changed over to the euro
These complaints , especially from those who , in our society , can least afford price increases , were justified in many cases
Last year , this Parliament asked the Central Bank to investigate those incorrect workings of the system that resulted in price increases
an amendment to this effect
I urge my fellow MEPs from the other groups again to vote in favour of an investigation , thereby enabling us to be consistent
Finally , this is a very difficult time , but it is not a time for losing heart
It is a time when we need leadership and vision
of continuing the work of his predecessor Mr Wim Duisenberg
Mr Trichet , your performance in office to date has helped to ensure , and indeed further enhance , the European Central Bank‚Äôs credibility and independence
the European Parliament
What makes the report convincing is its format , its clarity and the wealth of useful information it contains
We are glad to see that the ECB‚Äôs annual report stresses the maintenance of price stability as the Bank‚Äôs primary objective and principal task
that it has priority
This is where we are as one with the Group of the European People‚Äôs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats
We are also aware that the ECB is independent
The European Central Bank needs no lectures on what its interest rate policy should have been like in the past or what it must be like in the future
aggressive cutting of interest rates
of reforms , particularly in the large euro zone countries
for far too long , been put off or tackled merely half-heartedly
To these things , Mr Trichet , you have already referred in your speech
champion of transparency
of the meetings of its Governing Council , including the voting results in full , albeit without attribution of individual votes
Group of the European People‚Äôs Party has also called for
This would enable the public to have first-hand and readily-accessible information on the economic positions of their own country and of all the countries in the euro zone
Such a volume would make for greater transparency and could also build up the public‚Äôs identification with the European Union
the Stability and Growth Pact and , together with Eurostat , to compel the countries of the euro zone to produce reliable figures
What has happened with Greece must not be allowed to happen again
We look forward to your feedback , Mr Trichet , and to continued close cooperation with you in the future
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there are economic theories that are astoundingly impervious to reality
growth
inflation in the euro zone currently stands at just above 1% , which is verging on deflation
Has this brought us less unemployment and more growth
The crisis is , of course , attributable not only to misguided monetary policy
benefits , thereby helping to strangle mass purchasing power and to increase poverty in Europe
Monetary policy does , however , bear its share of responsibility as a result of cuts in interest rates that have been too late and not enough
years ‚Äì not a few of them because the high cost of borrowing has bled small businesses dry
market and when cuts in key interest rates serve primarily to increase the finance houses‚Äô profit margins , instead of being felt by smaller enterprises and consumers
In this respect , too , the ECB has failed
increasing profits
To the ECB , those who look at the world from this angle
Mr President , by setting up a currency union with a common currency , twelve of the EU Member States have taken considerable risks with employment
The EU countries are characterised by limited ability to adjust to various structural changes and are therefore afflicted by permanently high unemployment figures
thousands of German workers forced needlessly into unemployment
These problems will increase when industrial activity shifts to Eastern Europe and Asia , badly affecting each of the eurozone countries to varying degrees during the next five years
Unfortunately , the policy of the European Central Bank has exacerbated these unemployment problems in quite a few Member States
In common with most modern central banks , the European Central Bank operates mainly with an inflation target
This is completely in accordance with economic theory , but too low a target has been chosen
The central banks in Great Britain , Sweden , New Zealand and the United States have higher inflation targets
Modern research indicates that the inflation target should be set at an average of 2
5% or perhaps 3% over an economic cycle so as not to drive people unnecessarily into unemployment
The ECB and its top people should therefore increase their inflation target to an average of at least 2
5%
They deserve to be sharply criticised for their inability to adjust their policy to the way in which the European mixed economy operates
to know how he feels about it
Commission and may perhaps continue to be such for a little longer
Did the question present itself to you , too , as to what we in Europe have done wrong
approach
be effective
The same is of course true of the other crucial question about inflation that you , the new President , must ask yourself
It was apparent from your speech that there are certain areas in which we appear already to be moving back from deflation towards inflation
What the Greek Government has pulled off , with the more or less active collaboration , or in any case , negligence , of Eurostat , could perhaps become a problem in other countries
‚Äì to be much more critical , and much more vigilant , than your predecessor
of data , really serious problems with transparency
I share the view that more transparency would be a good thing
The President allocated me two minutes and thirty seconds , and I would like to make full use of them
trust , which has been consistent and has met with success , and for your defence of the Stability and Growth Pact
not yet realised that there is a link between stable prices , low inflation , growth and employment
for which the European Central Bank aims , and on the success of your policy of making the ECB more independent and a stronger and communicative player
over the national issuing banks
rates of inflation , of stable prices , of growth and employment and of the benefits to the economy
We do know that the euro is worth more than the public think it is
independence
in its quest for price stability
Is the euro zone economy , for all that , in good health
Obviously not
Results are mediocre , growth is weak , domestic demand is running out of steam and unemployment is severe , whilst inequality and poverty are on the rise
stability in Europe with weak growth and high unemployment
the investment needed to meet the Lisbon objectives or by laying the groundwork for a counter-cyclical budgetary policy capable of restarting the machine during periods of slowdown
forms of economic governance from any political control
I would add that the upshot of this choice is that the most damaging strategies are encouraged
This report , despite its author‚Äôs opinion , is thus symptomatic of this phenomenon
In demanding structural reforms , it stigmatises social systems and pension schemes
It also calls for an increase in the working hours of European workers
(Christian Democrats) and European Democrats
Accordingly , we shall submit several amendments in the course of this debate , and if those amendments are not adopted we will vote against
Bank
I have read this report with more than the average level of interest
taken on board
This brief and pithy resolution contained not only political but also practical wishes
the EUR 1 note
Personally , I cannot see the need for such a note , but I would like the Bank to investigate this in view of confidence in the currency
On page 101 of your annual report , you indicate that the Executive Council will revisit this issue in the autumn of 2004
My first question to you , Mr Trichet , is why you did not , in accordance with Parliament‚Äôs resolution , set up a working party
the EUR 1 note
to the Stability and Growth Pact
with regard to how the Stability Pact is to be handled
It is in fact you who guarantee the Stability Pact in the euro zone
Here , I am referring in particular to the example of Greece , where we need Europe to exert tighter control , something that I hear said , alas , all too infrequently , even today
and , if they were not , new ones could be called for
Otherwise they would not be regarded as having been reported
That would be a first step , and we expect to have to debate and decide , within the life of this Parliament , whether more currencies are to be added
are correct
I find it intolerable that it has to date been impossible to give an answer as to whether or not the figures as submitted are accurate
Let me just briefly turn to what you had to say about the CESR
legal system to circumvent this and arrive at redefinitions
We ask you to see to it that these regulators do not lack a legal basis on which to act
the European Central Bank‚Äôs independence represented by parliamentary control and responsibility
stability and enlargement of the eurozone
The concern stems from the slow economic activity during 2003 , particularly in the eurozone , and the continuing risks to growth
The Union has been designed to bring about both stability and growth; either one of them alone is not enough
Commissioner Almunia‚Äôs initiative is , therefore , very appropriate , and is going to require support
emphasis on a close association between the European Central Bank and investment and growth policy
Nevertheless , the need for structural reforms must not become distorted through erroneous signals; the link between weak economic activity and low working time must therefore be excluded from the resolution
It is not compatible with the criteria of flexibility rather than rigidity , or the productivity criteria
The essential thing is to create more value per unit of time rather than more units of time
In short , a downward model will have a dissolving effect , and we need integrated , intelligent and ambitious economic governance in the economic , social and environmental fields
Mr President , in this final intervention I would like to emphasise three points
the Bank
and not to listen to the sirens‚Äô songs from the left trying to lure him towards other objectives
Lisbon reforms
Because if the pact is broken or made more flexible , we will need tomorrow's taxes to pay for today's obligations
Why are we not growing
set for them in the Lisbon Pact and which appear in the broad economic guidelines
must take and the timetable we must respect
Mr President , do not take any notice of the governments when they urge you to look the other way when fiscal decisions are not complied with
so much success , and convince the Commissioner that that is the course to follow
interesting questions that have been asked
I would ask you , Mr Trichet , to reply in writing to those Members who have asked questions , with a copy to the President of Parliament
like to congratulate the President of the European Central Bank , Mr Trichet , on the excellent quality of the report we are debating today
There has been much agreement during the debate , and this is reflected in the report and has been expressed by the majority of Members who have spoken
of creating an Economic and Monetary Union and creating a single currency with a system enshrining the independent status of the European Central Bank
the state of growth in the European Union , particularly in 2003 , referred to in the report we are debating today , but also during 2004
Macroeconomic stability , healthy macroeconomic policies , the independence of the European Central Bank , are necessary conditions , but they are not sufficient
And we will of course have the opportunity to debate it from next week
our model of growth
today being a good example of that
Independence is not incompatible with dialogue
takes place under the best possible conditions , today being an example of that
I would like to make some specific comments , Mr President
conflict in the Council in November 2003 had mortally wounded that Pact
framework for economic governance is still the one decided upon at the beginning of Economic and Monetary Union
turn it into reality in a more effective and consistent manner than we have managed so far
Secondly , I would like to make a comment , , as Mr Trichet would say , on the one and two cent coins
The notes fall within the competence of the European Central Bank , and Mr Trichet will say what he needs to say on behalf of the Bank
must ensure regulations are complied with
and that is laid down in the regulations and it is the Commission‚Äôs duty to ensure that remains the case in the future
Finally , a comment on the economic situation mentioned by Mr Trichet
we have been experiencing over recent months
which have been raised
I simply wished to confirm that the nature of the dialogue between Parliament and the European Central Bank is such that we have recently decided to publish our quarterly forecasts
This was one of Parliament‚Äôs suggestions , and we are therefore taking a very important step in a direction referred to by several speakers
the Hungarian Parliament which we do not believe is acceptable , and which may well need to be the subject of a debate in the near future
This is why I think that it was important for me to be able to reply to you straight away
independence guaranteed under the Treaty of Maastricht
This was all that I wished to say , Mr President , and I have abided by your request
That concludes the debate
The vote will be tomorrow at 12
30
25 October , 25 years after the approval of that Statute
talking about an Organic Law of the Spanish State which has not been fully complied with
believe has been highly satisfactory
laws have not been complied with
I would like to focus on one of the points in the Lipietz report ‚Äì the possible abolition of the 1 and 2 cent coins
This issue has raised concerns in most of the Member States
Irish consumer organisations are concerned about the possible inflationary implications of following other Member States in reducing the usage of these small coins or indeed withdrawing them
Listening to discussions in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee , it is not clear if these concerns are grounded or not
The debate has centred on statements of personal preference proposing/opposing the argument , using the Netherlands and Finland as case examples
But facts from impact assessment analysis , consumer surveys and so on remain hard to find
The Central Bank of Ireland , as in other Member States , is aware that the cost of minting and distributing both coins is substantially greater than their face value
This does alleviate concerns
Mr Trichet , can you give us the facts on the inflationary effects or otherwise of abolishing the 1 and 2 cent coins
Finally , is the ECB in favour of abolishing these coins as a positive move for the future
The next item is the Commission statement on restructuring of the automobile sector
I shall give the floor straight away to Mr Rehn , to speak on behalf of the Commission

Mr President , we have all seen the latest news about the large-scale job cuts that were announced a few days ago by a major automobile manufacturer
The Commission fully understands the worries and sympathises with the workers in R√ºsselsheim , Bochum , Trollh√§ttan and elsewhere
We are following these developments very closely using the Community competences that are available to us to facilitate better industrial conditions for the car industry in Europe
The sector's difficulties stem partly from the general economic downturn over the past few years
The low GDP growth rate in the EU has had its repercussions on the car industry too
Thus we have seen a decline in sales of motor vehicles and a decline in employment in the automotive industry
Therefore , improving general consumer confidence and economic dynamism is also crucial for the demand and sales of cars
Competitiveness , economic reform and new industrial policy are now high on the political agenda of the Commission and will receive even more focus in the new Commission
We shall also soon learn how Mr Kok proposes to revise the Lisbon strategy to put more weight on higher growth and better job creation
the context of our annual competitiveness report
economy
Its added value and employment have , however , declined between 2000 and 2002
A similar development in employment took place in the US and Japan
Our analysis of Europe's strengths reveals that , due to the large home market , the European motor vehicle industry is well positioned to exploit economies of scale
Moreover , due to the sophisticated demand , EU manufacturers get advance feedback from their customers , which helps them improve product quality
US and Japan
In terms of weaknesses , EU productivity is still lower than that in the US and Japan
over time
Compared to the current level of productivity in the Union , the level of labour costs presents a serious challenge for the car industry in some Member States
Labour costs per hour in the European Union are still somewhat below those in the United States but significantly higher than those in Japan and especially Korea
We can best compete if we can offer better quality , better technology and better services that come with a car
This underlines the importance of innovation
As has been shown by some manufacturers , an agreement can also be reached with the workforce , aimed at reducing costs
For this to happen there has to be a common understanding between management and the workforce as to what objectives are to be achieved
Such agreements make sense if they can be used to save employment , to keep manufacturing locations and to make the car industry more competitive
With regard to threats , our studies see a danger that major innovations are not stimulated by European regulations
in Europe and on the whole world market
This must be addressed by policies of better regulation , which is a major challenge for both of us , the Commission as well as for Parliament
in the sector
This high-level group should also focus on the cumulative impact of legislation on the sector's competitiveness
It is up to the new Commission to take a position on the setting up of such a group
Commissioner Verheugen , or rather Vice-President-designate Verheugen , said at his hearing in front of you in the European Parliament that he is considering setting up such a group
I will certainly support him if he chooses to do so
In conclusion , the Commission is doing its utmost to offer the best possible industrial and innovative framework conditions for the car industry , for the European automotive industry
We need to further develop dialogue in the sector with the main stakeholders involved
Moreover , we must revise the Lisbon strategy of growth and employment to revitalise economic dynamism and to strengthen consumer demand on our continent
Growth and employment must indeed be put centre stage in all Union activities
Has Europe failed as an industrial location
In order to save EUR 500 million , the American General Motors group is seeking to cut up to 12 000 jobs in the EU
Our motor industry is a key industry; two million people work in it , with ten million in firms supplying it
been created in this sector ‚Äì or has Germany failed as an industrial location
At Opel , in R√ºsselsheim , 4 500 jobs are to be cut back
The people affected live in my electoral district , and I have met them
Fear is in the air
After all , they have worked for years already , helping to reduce the costs of the Olympia model
management have to be discussed
part of the management
provocation
Workers‚Äô participation has , particularly when times are hard , resulted in consensus , has secured industrial peace and has always been to the benefit of both sides
agreement on their future in Europe
In my experience , workers are always willing to accept austerity measures if these keep their jobs safe in the long term
no factories should be closed down and that no redundancies should be permitted
What , then , lies behind this crisis
It has been brought about by years , if not decades , of high-level mismanagement in the group
for European consumers , and no strategy for making use of the knowledge , expertise and skills of the relevant companies‚Äô workers
What this very clearly shows is that a change of direction is needed here
It has been said , and rightly , that industrial policy must be put back on the agenda for the European institutions
the various industries that are important to Europe
We are only just beginning to get to grips with the future of European industrial policy
When this House debates the European works councils , we will be reminding you of how important it is that workforces be allowed to speak and that they be involved
I have no sympathy whatever with the Liberals and Conservatives who have prevented a joint resolution from emerging from this debate
You , ladies and gentlemen , have some lessons to learn
but I particularly want to support the workers in Bochum who went on strike
read of their fate in the newspapers
future , including by the Commission
take on the task as part of the Lisbon strategy
I do not know if we are actually prepared , politically speaking , for what lies ahead of us
I share Mr Bullmann‚Äôs misgivings
missed in recent decades
Mr Rehn spoke about research and development policy
that is to say , the cars of the future , built in German and European factories
of ever-bigger , ever-faster cars at ever-higher prices
Being from Lower Saxony myself , I would like to address one particular problem affecting the motor industry there , and in Germany and Europe as well
In recent years , the Commission , represented by Commissioner Bolkestein , has repeatedly attacked the VW Act , under which Volkswagen operates
It so happens that the Volkswagen Group is a living example of an innovative business culture
000
market rules , is also an attack on this exemplary business culture
Mr President , I believe I am the only car worker in this Parliament
My previous job was in a car factory , so this debate is that much more relevant to myself
What we now see is huge pressure for change in the European car industry
Factory is pitted against factory and worker against worker
It is the metal workers who have to pay the price through having to do less satisfying work at high speed
I think that a lot of what is happening is unacceptable
It cannot just be a simple matter of making thousands of workers redundant
We must demand that companies accept their social responsibility
They have a social obligation towards those who work in the factories
They should enter into dialogue with authorities and trade unions in order to find solutions , such as shorter working hours , other than laying off the work force
What we also see is that the regulations are inadequate
Stronger union rights are required , together with intensified cooperation between unions within one and the same company
I think it good that the Commissioner mentioned demand in his introduction
It is true that demand is too low
The question that must also be asked , however is: demand for what
for example ethyl alcohol
much further ahead with the work on developing more environmentally friendly vehicles
This is one of the sins committed by managements in the European car industry
